## Geography
The Sea of Lost Lights lies in the region of Shadesmar corresponding to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical]] nations of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], and [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]], as well as the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]], [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]], and [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. To the west, it flows into the [[Sea of Souls\|Sea of Souls]]; to the east, it reaches the shores of the [[Expanse of the Broken Sky\|Expanse of the Broken Sky]] and [[Expanse of the Vapors\|Expanse of the Vapors]]. A stretch of land separates it from [[Thaylen Sea\|Thaylen Sea]], the Cognitive representation of the island of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]].

### Topographical Features
Like all "seas" in Shadesmar, the Sea of Lost Lights isn't filled with water, but rather small beads that represent the various [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] aspects of physical objects. There are no winds in Shadesmar, and the only known weather phenomenas are the highstorm and the strips of clouds common to the subastral. Nonetheless, the sea roils and the beads constantly move and clack against each other.
The Sea of Lost Lights has numerous peninsulas, corresponding to Physical rivers, and several small islands, equivalent to lakes. The land is made from a material akin to dark glass or obsidian. Channel's are occasionally cut through the peninsulas to make sea travel easier. Many of these channel's are cut through the peninsulas that represent the [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend River]].

### Ecology
There is a variety of plant life in Shadesmar, which, like in the Physical Realm, appears to differ based on region. In the northern section of the Sea of Lost Lights, fernlike plants and mushroom trees can be found growing along the peninsula shorelines that reflect rivers in Alethkar. Further south, a jungle made of black trees with multicolored leaves, red trees that end in minerals, and moss, can be found on the island representing the [[Longbrow's Straits\|Longbrow's Straits]]. Along the southern edge of the Sea of Lost Lights, there are crystal trees with spikey limbs and no leaves.
A fairly sizeable population of non-sapient [[Spren\|spren]] that live within the ocean of beads.

### Notable Locations
True spren live in a number of cities and other settlements within Shadesmar. The Sea of Lost Lights includes the following settlements;


[[Celebrant\|Celebrant]]
[[Candlemore\|Candlemore]]
[[Emberdark\|Emberdark]]
[[Burning Gardens\|Burning Gardens]]
[[Ravizadth\|Ravizadth]]
[[Riino's lighthouse\|Riino's lighthouse]]

## History
At some point in recent past, [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] attempted to conquer all of Shadesmar, including the Sea of Lost Lights. The attempt left them with a poor reputation among other sapient [[Spren\|spren]]. For this reason, they are rare in places like [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]], although their warships still sail there.
At the beginning of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], many cities in the Sea of Lost Lights were taken over by the [[Fused\|Fused]], although they ruled rather lightly, save for occasionally setting things on fire.
After being transported to Shadesmar through the corrupted [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], and their spren, as well as [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Azure\|Azure]], got trapped in the Sea of Lost Lights. They traveled to [[Riino's lighthouse\|Riino's lighthouse]], where they managed to find passage to [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] on a ship crewed by [[Reacher\|Reachers]] and pulled by [[Mandra\|mandra]]. There, they were chased by the Fused and ended up taking refuge on the honorspren ship *Honor's Path*. When the Fused were seen chasing the ship, the humans and their spren escaped, before traveling over the island that represented [[Longbrow's Straits\|Longbrow's Straits]] to reach [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]].
