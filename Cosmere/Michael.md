**Michael** is a student at [[Armedius Academy\|Armedius Academy]] on the isle of [[New Britannia\|New Britannia]].

## Appearance and Personality
He has blond hair. He is privileged, and does not like being reminded that he is not a [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatist]]. He is flirtatious with female students, including [[Eva Winters\|Eva Winters]] and [[Mary Isenhorn\|Mary Isenhorn]].

## History
Michael attended Armedius Academy at the same time as [[Joel Saxon\|Joel Saxon]]. Michael was the son of a [[Knight-senator\|knight-senator]] and was thought of as an important person on the Armedius campus, since he would one day become a knight-senator himself. He was also well-known for the large parties that he held at his summer home in the north.
Joel tutored Michael in math after class; Michael hoped to attend law school after the Academy. The two of them got along well and sometimes hung out together at school. Joel often talked to Michael about [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatics]], but Michael was uninterested. He barely understood how Rithmatics worked and expressed disdain for the Rithmatic students, although he was curious about the true state of affairs at the [[Tower of Nebrask\|Tower of Nebrask]]. Like many people, he questioned Joel's obsession with Rithmatic theory given the fact that he could not become a Rithmatist himself. Because of Joel's low social standing, Michael did not invite him to his summer party.
