**Dean Knighthawk** is the owner of [[Knighthawk Foundry\|Knighthawk Foundry]].
"Dean Knighhawk" is actually an alias, as he thought his given name was stupid. He was born paralyzed, and can only move his head. Instead, he uses epic technology to assume the powers of a telepathic puppeteer, [[The Wooden Soul\|The Wooden Soul]]. With his human-sized wooden puppet, he can carry himself around and work. Knighthawk is pudgy, with drooping jowls.

## History
### Amala
He was friends with [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Jonathan Phaedrus]] prior to Calamity, as was his wife [[Amala\|Amala]]. She became an [[Epic\|Epic]], and succumbed to Calamity's darkness. Phaedrus had to kill her. Since then, Knighthawk has been gathering the powers of healing Epics, but none can revive her. After Phaedrus turned evil, Knighthawk agreed to help [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]] if he would help Knighthawk get Phaedrus' healing powers. He spent the rest of the book monitoring things with his hacking abilities and texting David.
After the events of [[Calamity\|Calamity]], Knighthawk did in fact get his wife back, possibly by Prof's healing powers, although the complete story is more complicated.

### El Paso
After a large Epic battle takes place at El Paso, Knighthawk travels there and sets up a mobile lab to collect DNA from the dead Epics. [[Parik\|Parik]], [[Lifeforce\|Lifeforce]]â€™s head scientist, joins Knighthawk to spy on him and learn his secrets, saying he is part of the California Reckoners. [[Jax (Reckoners)\|Jax]] and [[Zeff\|Zeff]], from the Texas Reckoners, meet Knighthawk at El Paso to get some Motivator technology, and Jax impresses Knighthawk with his knowledge of motivators. Jax gives Knighthawk some suggestions, and Knighthawk gives him the fathom motivator.
