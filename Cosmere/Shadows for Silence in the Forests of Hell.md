## Development and Publication
George R.R. Martin approached Brandon about contributing an anthology short story during a book signing at a convention circa 2011. Brandon eagerly accepted, and decided to create a "dangerous woman" that did not adhere to familiar tropes. He was inspired by the puritan name "Silence", and wanted to make the dangerous part of her character something unexpected. The [[Simple Rules\|Simple Rules]] regarding [[Shade\|Shades]] are vaguely based in Jewish traditions. [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] came up with the planet name "[[Threnody\|Threnody]]", although the name was not revealed until after publication.
The story ended up being around 18,000 words in length. An  was released on Tor's website in July 2013, and the anthology was published on December 3, 2013. Claudia Black supplied the narration for the audiobook version.
*Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell* was bundled with *Perfect State* in a hardcover edition as a 2015 Con Exclusive.
The story also appears in the cosmere short story omnibus *Arcanum Unbounded*, accompanied by an essay on the [[Threnodite system\|Threnodite system]] and a postscript.

## Setting
The story takes place on one of the two major continents on the planet [[Threnody\|Threnody]], in an area known as the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]]. The action centers around [[Silence's waystop\|Silence's waystop]] and the forests nearby.
Threnody is not considered a "major" [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] in the overall narrative of the cosmere and is not currently inhabited by a Shard, but past events in the Threnodite system still hold direct relevance to current events occurring in the universe. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] does not appear in the story, though other [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] may have.

## Plot Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see Summary:Shadows for Silence.
The story follows [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]], the proprietress of a [[Waystop\|waystop]] in the Forests of Hell and secret identity of the legendary bounty hunter known as “The White Fox.” Desperate to remain solvent and keep her waystop out of the hands of her creditor [[Theopolis\|Theopolis]], she takes on the challenge of hunting down [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]], a notorious highwayman, and his crew. The complexity of the job quickly escalates as the night goes on. By the end, there are unexpected consequences for everyone involved.

## Potential Sequel
For more information, see [[The Dust Brigade\|The Dust Brigade]].
Brandon was pleased with the story and has consistently referred to writing a novel set on Threnody, partly because he would use the novel to introduce a group with relevance to the overall cosmere. It is unlikely that Silence would appear in the story, except as a potential cameo.
