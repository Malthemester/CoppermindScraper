**Midpeace** is a period that marks the middle of the [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] year.
The Rosharan year is 500 days long and ends with a four week period of rain known as the [[Weeping\|Weeping]]. Midpeace occurs at the midpoint between Weepings. [[Highstorm\|Highstorms]] occur more frequently as Midpeace approaches and after it ends, but they do not occur at all during Midpeace. Although the exact duration of Midpeace is not mentioned, it is the longest sustained period on Roshar without rain; since "natural" storms that are not highstorms or the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] are rare, many rivers typically dry up by the end of Midpeace.
Residents of Roshar use the fair weather of Midpeace to celebrate and travel. [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], and possibly other nations hold outdoor festivals known as [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fairs]]. [[Yokska\|Yokska]] mentions traveling to [[Liafor\|Liafor]] during Midpeace to see the latest fashion trends.
