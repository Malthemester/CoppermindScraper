## Appearance and Personality
Droz is [[Liaforan\|Liaforan]]. He is lanky and has dark brown eyes and skin. He is curious about [[Kaza\|Kaza's]] royal lineage and her [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] [[Savant\|savanthood]], and strikes up a conversation with her before she scares him away. As a helmsman, he successfully steers the *First Dreams* through a raging storm.

## History
Droz accompanies his captain [[Vazrmeb\|Vazrmeb]] in pursuit of rumored hidden treasure on the island of [[Akinah\|Akinah]] in [[Aimia\|Aimia]].
