**Laqqi** is a village in central [[Emul\|Emul]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It lies in a rural area near the country's northern border with [[Azir\|Azir]].

## History
Laqqi and the surrounding lands were contested as part of the war in Emul during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces took control of most of Emul early in the war, but by early 1175, Azish forces fighting for the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] recaptured the northern half of the country.
After deciding to launch an offensive into Emul, [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] set up a warcamp in Laqqi due to its strategic location about a three day march away from the battlefront. A large number of coalition troops, [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], and leaders temporarily relocated to the city. New tents and buildings were erected, and the village was fortified against storms and [[Singer\|singer]] attacks. In keeping with cultural norms, the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] leaders stayed in austere stone lodging, while the Azish built the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] luxurious quarters. Laqqi served as an effective base, and the offensive into Emul was ultimately successful.
The warcamp in Laqqi was the site of Odium and Dalinar's agreement to hold a contest of champions.
