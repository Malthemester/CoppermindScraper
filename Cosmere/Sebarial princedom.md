## Geography
Sebarial princedom is located in the south of Alethkar, bordered to the north by [[Thanadal princedom\|Thanadal]], to the west by [[Hatham princedom\|Hatham]] and [[Bethab princedom\|Bethab]], to the east by the [[Sea of Spears\|Sea of Spears]] and the [[Eastern Crownlands\|Eastern Crownlands]], and to the south by the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]]. The city of [[Rashir\|Rashir]] is located near the western border with Bethab. The [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend River]] flows through the princedom and its tributaries appear to define parts of the eastern border.

## History
The princedom was founded by one of the ten sons of [[Sadees\|Sadees]] the Sunmaker, who split up Alethkar after his death.

## Warcamp
Like the other princedoms, Sebarial contructs a large warcamp at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. Highprince Sebarial focuses on commerce rather than battle, and his warcamp is notably more advanced than the other camps. It has running water, shops, taverns, well-engineered housing, farms, twelve factories making various goods and supplies, and an information station with scribes and [[Spanreed\|spanreeds]], including at least one connected to [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]]. The camp's gates are open all night. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] thought Sebarial's camp looked more like a city than the other camps.
[[Little Herdaz\|Little Herdaz]] is inside the warcamp, and a number of Herdazians live there even if they are not from Sebarial princedom. [[Lopen\|Lopen]] and other Herdazians disguise [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] and bring him into Little Herdaz to recover after an assassination attempt by [[Moash\|Moash]].

### Manor
Sebarial and his [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]] mistress [[Palona\|Palona]] live in a manor in the camp. Although not as large as manors in Alethi cities, it is far more elaborate than other buildings in the warcamps. The house's exterior has classical columns and is situated behind taller buildings to avoid wind damage. The gardens have ornamental [[Shalebark\|shalebark]], trees, and a flagstone driveway. The interior is mostly white stone with marble, crystal, glass windows, and gold-trimmed statues. There are numerous maids and footmen.
When [[Shallan\|Shallan]] arrives at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], she invites herself into Highprince [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] entourage. She moves into the manor and is surprised by the level of affluence displayed by Sebarial. Her guest quarters are white stone, with a sitting room and rich furnishings.

## Move to Urithiru
Sebarial is one of the few highprinces that sends his armies to join [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] assault on the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] that results in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. This gains him a measure of respect with Dalinar, who names Sebarial the Highprince of Commerce in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Sebarial is given a section of Urithiru and relocates most of the people in his warcamp to the city. Some operations remain at the warcamp due to the need for agriculture and lumber, although Sebarial thinks this is not sustainable and expresses concern about [[Thanadal\|Thanadal]] taking over the camps.
Most of Sebarial's soldiers end up joining the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] army. Shallan decides to live in Sebarial's section of Urithiru, and notes that it stays busier than the rest of the city, much like his warcamp.
