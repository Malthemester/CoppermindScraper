**Stefan Sauvage** is a [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] nobleman and the father of [[Nicelle Sauvage\|Nicelle Sauvage]].

## History
In 336 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Lord Sauvage commissioned a large tapestry map of [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. He included a secret pocket in the map that contained a letter to his daughter Nicelle (also known as Nicki Savage). The letter supposedly included information that Stefan had learned about lost [[Metallic Arts\|metal]] beings created by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] that he called [[Kalki\|kalkis]]. By 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], he had presumably died, as Nicelle referred to the map as her inheritance.
[[Nazh\|Nazh]] stole the map from Nicelle, but after a brief struggle that tore the map in two, she was able to get back the piece that had the hidden pocket. Nazh escaped with the "better" part of the map. Nicelle was known to embellish her stories, but Nazh did in fact annotate a ripped map of New Seran. The details of Stefan's letter remain unknown, and it is not clear if Nazh was aware of it.
