*The Elendel Daily* is a broadsheet published in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is prone to sensationalism.

In an issue from 341 PC , the edition number is written in the [[Steel alphabet\|Steel alphabet]] as [[Steel alphabet\|]][[Steel alphabet\|]][[Steel alphabet\|]][[Steel alphabet\|]][[Steel alphabet\|]][[Steel alphabet\|]]; this is thought to equate to the number 8,042.
