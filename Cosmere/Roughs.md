The **Roughs** are the frontier regions outside the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] separated from the fertile basin by mountain ranges.
The ideal conditions in the basin meant that there was little pressure to expand following the founding of [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. As a result of this, the Roughs were sparsely populated and less advanced than the urban centers even generations later.
Giraffes inhabit the northern roughs, and acacia trees grow there.

## Wax's career
[[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] goes up to the Roughs as a bounty hunter. He kills [[Granite Joe\|Granite Joe]] and Perrin the Black, two of the most notorious criminals in the Roughs. He meets and works with [[Lessie\|Lessie]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]], and [[Miles\|Miles]] in the Roughs. He later realizes that [[Harmony\|Harmony]] sent him to the Roughs to toughen him for what he would have to later accomplish.
