**Edan** is a former [[Arelene\|Arelene]] baron on [[Sel\|Sel]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is lean and balding. He often appears fidgety and nervous, and has a tendency to blurt things out and interrupt the flow of conversation. He alternates between worrying about his financial problems and ignoring them in hopes that they will somehow disappear. His name is based on Aon Eda, which means "superior or lofty".
He is primarily concerned with self-preservation and admits to beating the peasants in his plantation to try and coax more production from them. His attitude towards [[Sarene\|Sarene]] indicates a degree of misogyny. [[Kiin\|Kiin]], [[Lukel\|Lukel]], and [[Ahan\|Ahan]] all dislike him, and he is thought of as spineless and arrogant.

## History
Edan was the baron of [[Tii Plantation\|Tii Plantation]], which primarily grew potatoes. Tii Plantation contained most of [[The Chasm\|the Chasm]] and the infertile land surrounding it, and Edan had never been particularly rich. Edan was a staunch supporter of [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] efforts to undermine King [[Iadon\|Iadon]] due to his inability to maintain power in Iadon's wealth-based caste system. In an effort to make more money, Edan made some questionable investments that were unsuccessful, leaving him nearly bankrupt and in danger of losing his barony within a few months. He continues to live in relative extravagance to hide his true financial situation.
Edan is among the few nobles who attend a meeting of Raoden's former supporters organized by Kiin and Lukel after Raoden is taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. Edan is very nervous about his future and Ahan mocks him mercilessly. Although Edan is dubious of Sarene's plan to increase the morale of Arelon's citizens, he goes along with her suggestions as he has no other options. When Sarene later suggests that the group should side with Elantris, Edan is taken aback, but is not able to argue with Sarene's logic.
Tii Plantation commences its planting for the season, but rain in the area causes mudslides in the fields. Edan presumably abandons any remaining hope of maintaining his barony and flees to [[Duladel\|Duladel]]. Lukel points out that the Dulas will not care about Edan's former nobility and he will likely end up as a farmer.
Despite the lack of resources in Tii Plantation, a number of minor nobles attempt to gain Edan's former title from Iadon. Raoden uses this as part of his cover story when he poses as "Kaloo".
