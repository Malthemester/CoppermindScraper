**Trellium** is the metal used by [[Paalm\|Paalm]] to hide from [[Harmony\|Harmony's]] sight and evade capture. It is the [[God Metal\|God Metal]], or an alloy of the God Metal, that is associated with the same [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] that is responsible for the entity known as [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trell]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Trellium is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust.

## Allomantic Use
When burned by an Allomancer, trellium has unknown properties.

## Feruchemical Use
When used by a Feruchemist, trellium has unknown properties.

## Hemalurgic Use
Trellium can steal Allomantic and Feruchemical abilities and grant them to kandra. Presumably its Hemalurgic ability is similar to that of [[Atium\|atium]], allowing the transfer of any ability with somewhat variable success depending on the binding point.
Using it as a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] spike can keep the user hidden from [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. This has a limited effect, however, and any more than a single spike will make the user visible to the Shard. It is an inherent property of the metal, and not a Hemalurgic attribute, that hides the user.

### Hemalurgic Constructs
[[Hemalurgic chimera\|Hemalurgic chimeras]] are created when a living human is implanted with a trellium spike. Due to their single spike, they are not susceptible to [[Harmony\|Harmony's]] control.

## Theories
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

It is possible that this is the metal referred to by [[Miles Hundredlives\|Miles Hundredlives]] in his last words as "the final metal."
Trellium is the God Metal, or an alloy of the God Metal, of a Shard that was known when it first appeared. It cannot be of Ruin or Preservation, as Harmony does not recognize the metal; it also cannot be of [[Ambition\|Ambition]], [[Invention\|Invention]], [[Mercy\|Mercy]], [[Valor\|Valor]], or [[Whimsy\|Whimsy]], as they were unknown when it first appeared; and it has been confirmed to not be of [[Endowment\|Endowment]]. It is almost certainly not the God Metal (or an alloy thereof) of [[Devotion\|Devotion]], [[Dominion\|Dominion]], or [[Honor\|Honor]] as they are all [[Splinter\|Splintered]], which leaves [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], and [[Odium\|Odium]] as the remaining possibilities. Cultivation has exhibited few signs of interest in affairs beyond [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and it seems unlikely that she was responsible for the metal.
Though Odium's Intent seems to drive him towards conflict with the other Shards, it is unlikely that he is responsible for trellium. Odium's God Metal, [[Raysium\|raysium]], is bright gold, which does not match the appearance of trellium; though this does not rule out the possibility that trellium is an alloy of raysium. Additionally, he might be reluctant to commit the Investiture required to create trellium, especially while he is waging the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] on Rosharâ€”[[Rayse\|Rayse]] has always planned to avoid Investing in a planet, though it is unclear whether Odium's new Vessel, [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], has similar feelings. Furthermore, Harmony distinctly mentions Odium in his second letter to [[Hoid\|Hoid]] but shares that he is worried that a Shard or Shards he cannot identify are encroaching on Scadrial, suggesting that Trell is not Odium or any of the other Shards Harmony is aware of.
By process of elimination, this suggests that trellium is of Autonomy. Notably, Autonomy is known among cosmere scholars as a Shard that often intervenes on other planets and has avatars on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]] and [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]]; [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trell]] may be an avatar of Autonomy manifesting on Scadrial.

## Trivia
In the *Alloy of Law: Masks of the Past* adventure game supplement, trellium allows kandra to use the Allomantic or Feruchemical abilities of another Hemalurgic spike they are spiked with. They also cannot be controlled by Harmony or brass Allomancy but they also lose their blessing.
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] has stated that "trellium" is an acceptable name for Paalm's metal.
