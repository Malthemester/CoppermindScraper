## Background
While on an unrelated sea voyage, the ship *First Dreams* was discovered by [[Smta\|Smta]], prompting Queen [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] to put out a request for an expedition to [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. Earlier attempts at sending [[Windrunner\|Windrunners]] (including [[Leyten\|Leyten]], [[Lyn\|Lyn]], and [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]]) encountered a hordeling able to siphon their [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in the weather pattern around Akinah. The *First Dreams* was then brought to port in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to undergo repairs. At this time, Rysn was both looking for a new voyage to undertake and a way to help Chiri-Chiri. Thinking this offer from Navani could fill both, she toured the *First Dreams*.
Having decided to accept the request, Rysn had Queen [[Fen\|Fen]] write to Navani regarding the expedition. Rysn then traveled to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and first met with [[Talik\|Talik]] to discuss Chiri-Chiri. She then met with Navani and negotiated and agreed on the terms of the expedition. Once the deal was accepted, Fen sent a writ to the crew of the *Wandersail* regarding the expedition.
After [[Lopen\|Lopen]] met with [[Ral-na\|Ral-na]] and Talik, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] spoke with Lopen regarding the mission and Lopen volunteered. Lopen then spoke with [[Huio\|Huio]] and [[Cord\|Cord]] about the expedition, and reported to [[Rushu\|Rushu]] to be briefed on confidential details about the expedition from Navani.

## The Trip to Akinah
Shortly before the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail's]] scheduled departure, Rushu, Lopen, Huio, and Cord travelled to Thaylen City via [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] from Urithiru. Just prior to that, the ship's pet, a skyeel named [[Screech\|Screech]], had died. The crew took this as a bad omen and were apprehensive of continuing. Rysn issued an order to allow any crew to leave without consequence, but only three took the offer.
With everyone aboard and ready, the *Wandersail* sets sail out of the port of Thaylen City.
A few weeks into the trip, Cord discovers that the *Wandersail'*s barrels of [[Lavis\|lavis]] are all contain worms. The crew sees this as another bad omen. In am effort to negate their superstitions, Rysn traded the wormy grain with [[Hexi\|Hexi]] nomads for jerky. The crew was placated and the voyage continued.
Following its two failed attempts at sabotage, the worms and the dead skyeel, [[Nikliasorm\|Nikliasorm]] conferenced with [[Yelamaiszin\|Yelamaiszin]] and the eighteen other [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] that accept Yelamaiszin's leadership. They decide to let Nikliasorm try one more omen before resorting to more drastic meausres.
Some time later, Huio tinkered with Rushu's spanreeds and made a discovery with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] in regards to conjoined fabrials. Just after this, a dead [[Santhid\|santhid]] is sighted. The crew debate for a moment what to do before the santhid dissolves into hordelings.
Shaken, the crew went ashore for a bit. Rysn used the opportunity to contact [[Vstim\|Vstim]] by [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]. While ashore, Rushu and Huio construct a hovering chair for Rysn to use based on his earlier discovery.
On the final approach to Akinah, Rysn confronted and detained Nikli and [[Plamry\|Plamry]], putting them on the main island of Aimia.

## At Akinah
The ship sailed into Akinah's strange storm and breached it without too much difficulty. Immediately after they exited the storm, Chiri-Chiri followed [[Luckspren\|luckspren]] underwater. Lopen and Rushu investigated the city of Akinah and discovered the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] in an underground cavern, beneath a fake Oathgate. Rysn and Cord escaped an attack by Nikli and were guided to the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] by luckspren. Huio and sailors from the *Wandersail* crew were then attacked by Nikli's giant hordeling on Akinah's beach. As other hordelings join in they quickly are surrounded. Lopen returned to aid in the battle against the giant hordelings. When Lopen was in danger of being killed, Huio swore the Third Ideal of the Windrunners and saved them both. Meanwhile, Rysn became the Dawnshard previously housed in the [[Akinah Dawnshard mural\|mural]]. Nikli and two other Sleepless entered the caverns, and Rysn and Cord negotiated a treaty with Nikli. The crew left with their lives and a few extra hordelings on board.

## Aftermath
On the way back, Lopen confronts Huio about his Third Ideal. Right after that, he swore his own Third Ideal. Three of the Soulcasters found were given to Alethkar, while five were given to Thaylenah. Some months later, Rysn tells Vstim about Dawnshards.
