**Mycalin** is a red dye used for coloring fabrics on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
The dye is somehow sourced from slugs that live on the shores of the [[Purelake\|Purelake]]. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] owns an [[Azish\|Azish]] cavalrylord's suit with Mycalin-dyed trousers. When he stains the trousers with [[Aether\|aether]], [[Mem\|Mem]] has a great deal of difficulty cleaning the stain without fading the fine red color or damaging the fabric, but she is eventually successful.
