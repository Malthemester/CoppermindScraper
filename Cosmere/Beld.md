**Beld** is a member of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Beld serves as a member of Bridge Four under [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]]. He is not a slave, so this is likely due to some indiscretion as a soldier. He presumably fights in the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]] with the rest of Bridge Four, although he is not mentioned by name. He is then freed from service under Sadeas when Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] trades his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], [[Oathbringer\|Oathbringer]], for the freedom of the bridgemen.
Despite the fact that he has never been a slave, Beld receives the Bridge Four freedom tattoo on his forehead, composed of the [[Glyph\|glyph]] for freedom, as well as the date of their freedom and the words "Bridge Four".
Beld also serves as a member of the [[King's Guard\|King's Guard]], protecting King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]]. During [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] first attempt on [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] life at the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]], Captain [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] sends Beld and [[Hobber\|Hobber]] ahead of the main group as an advanced guard. Beld is run through by Szeth's [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] and is killed instantly.
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] remembers him, [[Jaks\|Jaks]], [[Malop\|Malop]], [[Pedin\|Pedin]], [[Rod\|Rod]], [[Mart\|Mart]], [[Goshel\|Goshel]], [[Nalma\|Nalma]], [[Dallet\|Dallet]] and the squad, and [[Tien\|Tien]] while trying to say the Fourth [[Immortal Words\|Ideal]] of the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]].
