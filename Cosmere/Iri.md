## Geography and Ecology
The largest city in Iri is [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]], City of Shadows, followed closely by [[Kasitor\|Kasitor]]. Many people in Kasitor worship [[Cusicesh the Protector\|Cusicesh the Protector]], a giant [[Spren\|spren]], as a deity. Iri also contains the city of [[Eila\|Eila]]. Due to its northwestern position on Roshar, Iri is warmer than most other nations.

## History
The Iriali are not native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They believe that they are part of something they call the "Long Trail", of which they are currently in the Fourth Land; fans speculate that this means they have been to three planets before coming to Roshar. It is not known what those planets might be, or when they came to Roshar, though it is known that they migrated to Roshar from somewhere besides [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]], separately from the rest of humanity. They have had what most would consider to be inhuman ancestry in their past, depending on what is considered human.
By the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the eastern portion of Iri has split off to form the kingdom of [[Rira (country)\|Rira]]. Iri continued to claim Rira as a vassal, but that claim was disputed.
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] approached the monarchs of Iri in an attempt to persuade them to join the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. Iri claimed both that Dalinar had stolen their [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and that [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] was no longer relevant as a world power. They gave these as reasons not to side with the coalition, instead joining forces with the [[Fused\|Fused]], who offered them more power than they felt they could gain by siding with the humans. Furthermore, the Iriali people sought peace. Looking back at their histories, they realized that humans had never tried the tactic of capitulation as a way to avoid a [[Desolation\|Desolation]] and felt an obligation to try it, as it was an experience the [[One\|One]] had not yet explored.
By the time just after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Iri had struck eastward and, with the help of Odium's forces, captured most of the western kingdoms in the region of the Purelake. The country became both a stationing ground for troops and the center to which Odium's navy retreated following a defeat by the coalition.

## Politics
The Iriali are ruled by a triumvirate of rulers. The gender of the ruler is apparently unimportant, though currently they are ruled by two kings and a queen. The Queen currently has responsibilities over foreign policy. The nation of Iri claims authority over their "sister nation" of Rira, but Rira disputes that claim.

## Culture
The [[Iriali\|Iriali]] have metallic golden-blond skin and hair that breeds true. Many [[Alethi\|Alethi]] consider a lock of the golden hair of the Iriali to be good luck. The Iriali are particular about chastity laws, and dislike public nudity. The men often wear only waist wraps on warmer days. The Iriali also paint their skin with colors and patterns. The Iriali tend to be less quarrelsome and prudish than the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nations. They mostly have yellow eyes.
Iri has no [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]].

### Religion
The Iriali worship a god they call "The One". According to this belief, the One knew everything but had experienced nothing. And so the One became Many in order to experience all things. As each experience is different, it brings completeness to the One. Eventually, all will be gathered back in when the sum of land is attained and they will once again become One. Every person is a different mind of a single being experiencing different lives. As Many, they need ignorance. Each fragment of the One‚Äôs mind has its own body with different passions and inclinations. They exist in variety to experience all kinds of thought. That means some people must know and others must not. Just like some people must be rich and others poor.
It is likely that this belief is the same one spread by [[Arclo\|Arclo]].
The religion is at least somewhat related to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] with its philosophy of one becoming many.
The Iriali religion involves somehow reading portents of the future in the waves of the ocean. **Tidereaders** look at the waves and use what they see to make pronouncements about the future. The Iriali queen has a tidereader in her court.
The philosophy behind the One is that the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] and the [[Beyond\|Beyond]] are the same thing. When a person dies, their soul rejoins the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] of the Spiritual Realm. Most [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] philosophers disagree with this belief.
