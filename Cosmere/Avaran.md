**Avaran** is an darkeyed [[Alethi\|Alethi]] leatherworker on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
Avaran and his partner [[Yis\|Yis]] worked in [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] warcamp, one working on larger leather pieces, while the other handled fine details. He and Yis also had several apprentices working under their direction. They were consulted by [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] during the investigation into King [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin's]] broken saddle strap. Avaran and Yis both agreed that the strap had been cut. Avaran explained that he believed it likely happened accidentally by misfitting or improper storage of the saddle, but it was possible that it had been cut intentionally.
