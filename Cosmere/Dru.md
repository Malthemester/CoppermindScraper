**Dru** is a slender [[Alethi\|Alethi]] man on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
Dru worked in the district quartermaster's office. After the discovery of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Dru relocated there along with most of the other Alethi from the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. At some point he began seeing [[Drehy\|Drehy]], one of the men of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]].
After the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Dru boiled bandages for the wounded. As [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] had returned from [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] without Drehy, Dru believed that he had been killed and his eyes were reddened with grief. [[Lopen\|Lopen]] saw him working and patted him on his shoulder in an attempt to comfort him. He was presumably reunited with Drehy after Kaladin helped recover him, [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]] and the others from the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]].
