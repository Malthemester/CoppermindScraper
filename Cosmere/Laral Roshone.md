## Appearance and Personality
Laral is a lighteyed woman with pale green eyes. Her hair, black with golden streaks, proves she is not purebred [[Alethi\|Alethi]]; she wears it long and for a while dyes it totally black.
In the years prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], her appearance matures somewhat, her face becoming firm and lean. She also begins to wear her undyed hair in a tail and to wear much more utilitarian clothing than the fancier clothing she had worn previously.
While Hearthstone was occupied by the [[Fused\|Fused]], Laral wore a simple servant's dress, along with a gloved safe hand instead of a sleeve.

## History
 by  Sheep 
### Early Life
Laral was a childhood friend of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] while they grew up together in Hearthstone; they played together, and Kaladin often ate with her in the kitchens of her father's mansion. As they both matured, she began to flirt with him and he began to return her feelings. One day, she, Kaladin, and [[Tien\|Tien]] were out hunting [[Lurg\|lurgs]] when they noticed a group of boys congregating idly instead of worming the [[Lavis\|lavis]] polyps. Laral led Kaladin down to the others and thrust him into what was a very confusing confrontation for him, before returning home after [[Jost\|Jost]] beat Kaladin with his quarterstaff. Her father, who had been ill for several days, died that day while he was tended to by [[Lirin\|Lirin]]. Laral inherited the rest of Wistiow's wealth and was given a dowry by Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] in lieu of the authority over Hearthstone and her father's old property.

### Marriage
>“*You take after your father. Always feeling like you need to save everyone, even those who would rather you mind your own business.*”
\-Laral to Kaladin[6]

For several months after her father's death, Laral was confined to the mansion. With the coming of Brightlord [[Roshone\|Roshone]], she turned to courting his son and heir, [[Rillir\|Rillir]]. She began dressing as a true Alethi lighteyed woman in an effort to capture Rillir's attention, going so far as to treat Kaladin like an errand boy when the she and Rillir encountered him in the mansion's kitchen.
Laral was at Lirin's surgery room with Rillir after he was gored by a [[Whitespine\|whitespine]], panicking and yelling before her guards took her away. After Rillir's death from his wounds, she eventually became betrothed to Brightlord Roshone himself. She wore a bride's prayer [[Glyph\|glyph]] on her sleeve the day that Highprince [[Amaram\|Amaram]] arrived and took Tien and Kaladin into his army, though they did not formally announce their engagement at the time.
At some point during the years 1168 to 1174, Laral married [[Roshone\|Roshone]].
When Kaladin returned to Hearthstone in 1174, Laral berated him for damaging her floor with his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and, more importantly, for thinking that she needed "saving" from her marriage to Roshone. She expressed willingness to help the citizens of Hearthstone weather the new [[Everstorm\|everstorms]] and the lack of [[Parshmen\|Parshmen]], then operated a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] for Kaladin so he could speak with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] before heading back to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].

### The Occupation of Hearthstone
Laral conspired with [[Lirin\|Lirin]] to protect the [[Herdazian\|Herdazian]] General known as The [[Dieno\|Mink]], who was posing as a refugee. The plan is interrupted as [[Lezian\|Lezian]] arrives. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] is revealed to be amongst the refugees, instigating a battle. During the battle, Laral's home (the citylord's manor) is burned by [[Lezian\|Lezian]]. Laral's husband [[Roshone\|Roshone]] is killed by [[Vyre\|Vyre]] within the manor.
Laral is evacuated via The *Fourth Bridge* to Urithiru. Under [[Jasnah\|Jasnah's]] new inheritance laws, [[Laral\|Laral]] gained the title of citylady of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]], which entitled her to meet Queen Jasnah at [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].

## Relationships
### Kaladin
>“*Kal, if you go to war and find a Shardblade, then you'd be a lighteyes... I mean... Oh, this is useless.*”
\-Laral to Kaladin[2]


Laral and Kaladin are friends while growing up together in Hearthstone, though as they grow older, she becomes Kaladin's first crush. Kaladin's parents encourage him to play with her with the hope that one day they would marry. In the meantime, Laral herself encourages Kaladin to become a soldier and win a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] so that, as a lighteyes, he could be her equal in a marriage. When she moves on from him and becomes romantically involved with the Roshones, Kaladin has a difficult time accepting that she is doing so of her own choice.

### Roshone
 by  Sheep 
When Roshone was been given authority over Hearthstone, including possession of the mansion and surrounding lands, Highprince Sadeas gave Laral a dowry in compensation. Because of this, Roshone saw the need of marrying her into her family. She was originally engaged to his son, Rillir, but after his death in a hunting accident, this engagement was made to Roshone himself.
By the time of the True Desolation, Laral and Roshone had been married for several years. She claims satisfaction with the agreement and even defends him before Kaladin when he spoke ill of her husband. She seems to have used the marriage to become politically engaged and has strong loyalty from their soldiers.
Laral and presumably Roshone's children were evacuated from Hearthstone and now reside in Urithiru.
