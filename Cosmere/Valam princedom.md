## Geography and Ecology
[[House Davar\|House Davar's]] estates are located in the former Valam princedom. They are described as "backcountry" and it takes at least a half a day to travel across them. [[Revilar\|Revilar's]] lands border those of House Davar. The size of the princedom and its location within Jah Keved are not known, but [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] describes her family's lands as "nowhere near" the capital of [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] on the southern coast.
The area appears to have a temperate climate, with distinct seasons. Flora and fauna are typical of eastern Roshar, including [[Rockbud\|rockbuds]], [[Shalebark\|shalebark]], and [[Jella\|jella]] trees. Many species of [[Cremling\|cremlings]] also flourish. Domesticated animals include [[Axehound\|axehounds]] and horses.

## Economy
The princedom's lands are largely rural and contain a notable amount of arable land. Agriculture appears to drive the economy, including commodities such as [[Breachtree\|breachtree]] cotton and [[Shum (plant)\|shum]] as well as textiles made from those materials.

## History
The ruling family of the princedom was House Valam, led by Highprince [[Valam\|Valam]]. There were ten prominent [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] landowners who directly served Valam, including Lin Davar and Revilar. Valam used his illegitimate son [[Redin\|Redin]] as an enforcer. Valam had other children (including [[Sudi Valam\|Sudi Valam]]), but they all preceded him in death.
The princedom had sufficient power to emerge victorious in the bloody [[Veden civil war\|Veden civil war]] of succession in 1173. This victory was influenced by Taravangian and the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]], who had [[Szeth\|Szeth]] assassinate the other six highprinces who were vying for the throne. Valam became king of Jah Keved and quickly recognized that Taravangian had contrived this outcome. However, due to his severe illness and lack of heirs, he turned the kingdom over to Taravangian anyway. Valam then instructed Redin to kill him, presumably dissolving the Valam princedom.

## Politics
The landowners who served Valam effectively acted as autonomous rulers of their lands. The highprince lived in Vedenar and did not regularly visit many areas of the princedom.
