>“*Young lady, you need to get away from these people.*”
\-Gin to Marasi.[1]


Aunt **Gin** is the owner of the Copper Gate, a hotel in [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. [[Wax\|Wax]] and his group stay in her hotel.

## Appearance and Personality
She is described as having a masculine face. She wears an oversized hat festooned with flowers and she is easily flustered.

## History
>“*Fire? Shoot-outs. Robbery. Hostage situations. Explosions?*”
\-Aunt Gin reading from Steris' list.[1]

She escorted Wax and his group up to their suite on the top floor of the hotel where she said they would have the entire floor to themselves. While she was brushing off [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] first attempt at acquiring her hat Wax stomped by in his [[Mistcoat\|mistcoat]] and asked her if the windows of their suite opened. Turning pale she replied that they had been painted shut to keep them from rattling in the wind. She cut herself off with a gasp as Wax started tearing all of the windows open. Wayne tried trading one of his shoes and some of the hotel's peanuts for Gin's hat, but was interrupted by [[Steris\|Steris]] who proffered a notebook containing, among other things, a list of seventeen possible disasters that might befall them while they were staying in the hotel to Gin who with some shock and disbelief accepted it. [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] entered the room and, to the unease of all humans present, started discussing what size breasts she should wear to the party that night. After MeLaan's bags arrived with her bones Marasi escorted her out of the room. She tried convincing [[Marasi\|Marasi]], who seemed to be the only other sane person in the room, to leave these crazy people before she got hurt. Marasi brushed aside her concerns and, after asking Gin to find a list of graveyards for her, pushed her firmly out the door.
When the group was fleeing New Seran they gave Gin a large amount of cash before leaving the hotel. As they were pulling away in their carriage, hearing bells in the distance, Gin asked Wax if that was the sound of the constables coming to her. Wax replied that it was indeed the constables, and as they rolled away Steris yelled back at Gin that "framed for murder" was on page seventeen of her list.
