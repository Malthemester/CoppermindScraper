## Lines of Making
[[Rithmatics\|Rithmatists]] are able to create chalklings by drawing Lines of Making. More detailed and beautiful chalklings are stronger than more simplistic ones. The reason for this is unknown. The shape of a chalkling has a significant amount of influence on its abilities. A knight, for example, is strongest when attached to a bindpoint whereas a creature with long teeth and claws is better at attacking. Likewise an amorphous blob can take a number of hits from Lines of Vigor but moves slowly whereas a creature with many legs can move quickly but isn't as strong when attacking. Binding a chalkling to a Line of Warding strengthens it. Chalklings can be difficult to outrun and do not get tired.

### Glyphs
There are a wide variety of glyphs that are used to "program" chalklings. The sequence of glyphs is written beside the chalkling and determines which actions the chalkling takes, in what order, and for how long. Upon completion, the glyphs vanish and the chalkling begins executing its instructions. The form of the glyphs are not standardized, although the meanings of each glyph are fixed. An number below a glyph can be added to determine duration of a *Go* command or the angle of a *Turn* command.

## Wild Chalklings
The origin of wild chalklings is currently unknown. The first interaction between wild chalklings and European settlers is a subject of some debate as well.
When wild chalklings come across a human, they will attack him or her aggressively, leaving only a mangled corpse behind.
As of the events of [[The Rithmatist\|The Rithmatist]], wild chalklings are confined to the [[Tower of Nebrask\|Tower of Nebrask]], where they are led by creatures known as the [[Forgotten\|Forgotten]].
Acid is used to combat chalklings as it is able to dissolve them more swiftly and completely than water.
The Forgotten controlling [[Inspector Harding\|Inspector Harding]] was able to turn Rithmatists into wild chalklings that reformed when destroyed by chalk or acid.. After it was killed, the victims were restored. It is unclear whether all Forgotten have this ability.
The [[Scribbler\|Scribbler]] was able to turn captured Rithmatists into wild chalkings. These particular chalklings reform when destroyed by chalk or acid. After [[Joel\|Joel]], [[Melody\|Melody]], and [[Fitch\|Professor Fitch]] defeated the Scribbler, the victims are restored.
