**Kauri** is a [[Kitsen\|kitsen]] who travels to [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]] under the leadership of [[Hesho\|Hesho]] and acts as his shieldbearer and navigator.

## Appearance and Personality
For more information, see [[Kitsen\|kitsen]].
Kauri wears a red and gold uniform and carries an ornamental shield. This shield is a physical symbol of her duty as [[Hesho\|Hesho's]] shieldbearer. The duties and responsibilities of such a post are not made clear but it seems that shieldbearers serve as personal assistants, providing information and fulfilling menial tasks. She also is tasked with piloting a small hoverplatform that the kitsen of the *Gaualako-An* use as transport outside of their ship.
Kauri is the navigator of the *Gaualako-An*. Though her duties as a navigator are not clear, she is often tasked with explaining details about the universe in Hesho's stead. Consequently, she is knowledgeable, skilled at explaining, and generally helpful.

## History
Before coming to Starsight, Kauri worked as Hesho's navigator on the *Gaualako-An*. After arrival and after being accepted as a trainee, she changed ships to work again as Hesho's navigator on the *Swims Against the Current in a Stream Reflecting the Sun*, also known as the *Swims Upstream*. Kauri later takes control of the *Swims Upstream* after Hesho's death.
