\- Febrth to Graves[1]


**Febrth** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] man who is a member of the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Apperance and Personality
Despite being Thaylen, Febrth also has the characteristic red hair of an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]], indicating a mixed heritage. Febrth's belief in the Passions is unflinching, he believes that they will guide him so he has no outside information or guidance. Despite the fact that the Diagram asks that its members abandon their previous faiths, Febrth maintained that he could believe in both.
Febrth was a truly terrible cook, the stew he makes looks like mush and tastes of [[Crem\|crem]].

## History
Nothing of Febrth's early life is known. He was an ardent follower of the [[Passions\|Passions]] who was recruited by the Diagram. He accompanied [[Fia\|Fia]], [[Moash\|Moash]] and [[Graves\|Graves]] on their trip across the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] to [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. On one of the evenings that Febrth made stew for dinner, he and Graves argued about their location. Febrth believed that they needed to continue traveling south, despite what Graves's map indicated. Febrth believed that the Passions would guide him to their destination. Shortly later that same evening, their camp was ambushed by a group of the [[Fused\|Fused]] and Febrth was killed.
