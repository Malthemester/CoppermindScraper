## Geography
Svorden is located on a peninsula at the northeastern tip of [[Sycla\|Sycla]] (Opelon). The country has many miles of coastline and presumably controls an archipelago off its eastern shore. Most of its land border to the southwest is with [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]], with Fjordell fortifications just across the border. To the south, Svorden has a small river border with the nation of [[Geant\|Geant]] that includes their capital city of [[Velf\|Velf]]. The Svordish capital, [[Seraven\|Seraven]], is at the northeastern tip of the country. According to [[Adien\|Adien]], Svorden is two million one hundred six thousand two hundred and thirty-eight steps from [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]].

## History
Little is known of Svorden's history, but it was occupied and annexed by the new [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]] at least a century prior to the [[Reod\|Reod]]. Since being annexed, Svorden has operated as a vassal state of Fjorden; they adopted the state religion of the Empire, [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], and [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]] is in direct control of their government and military. Svorden's status as a center of culture and academics allowed the nation to maintain its way of life more than other Fjordell vassal states; they have continued to make scientific discoveries, and they have maintained diplomatic and trade relations with many other nations. Their most notable involvement in the ongoing conflict between the Empire and the [[Aonic\|Aonic]] nations of [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and [[Teod\|Teod]] was the addition of their formidable navy to Wyrn's military resources.

## Politics
### Government
Svorden is politically the second most important nation in the east, after Fjorden. Although Svorden is still referred to as a "kingdom", it is considered a de facto province of Fjorden. Positions of power in the government are given to devout followers of Shu-Dereth, as determined by the chain of command within the church.
Unlike other nations in the Empire, Svorden has maintained a strong national identity, including its own language. They also seem to have some control over their own diplomatic relations with other nations. [[Sarene\|Sarene]] served as a [[Teo\|Teo]] envoy in Seraven. Svorden once sent gifts, including a table, to the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]], but the relationship between the countries later became strained. Despite the ongoing hostility between Fjorden and Arelon, people of Aonic descent such as [[Lukel\|Lukel]] are allowed to travel to Svorden for schooling.

### Military
They are known for the strength of their navy. It was gladly commandeered by Wyrn Wulfden the Fourth after he annexed the country, since Fjorden itself lacked maritime strength. The navy is powerful enough to pose a serious threat to the [[Teo\|Teo]] armada. Svorden also has soldiers, although Wyrn has generally not utilized them.

## Culture
>‚Äú*Even with my training at the university in Svorden, I still couldn't follow half of his theories.*‚Äù
\-Lukel, on Raoden[13]

Svorden is the center of culture and learning in eastern Sycla, and the [[Svordish university\|Svordish university]] is well respected across the continent. Svordish scientists and philosophers are leaders in numerous academic fields, including anatomy, art, and astronomy. Theories espoused by Svordish scientists generally gain traction across Sycla, including the idea that humans can only retain six languages and that eclipses occur when the moon falls into the planet's shadow. Embalmed bodies are kept at the university for study. Svordish literature is well known on Sel and includes heroic epics. [[Shai\|Shai]], a citizen of the distant Rose Empire, is able to read books written in Svordish.
The Svordish game of [[Leky stick\|leky stick]] is popular in a number of nations. Shark fights are held in Svorden as a form of entertainment.
It is not known if Svorden has a regional Invested Art that allows its residents to access the [[Dor\|Dor]].

### Religion
As part of the Fjordell Empire, the Svordish people are required to follow the [[Derethi\|Derethi]] religion. The concept of [[Svrakiss\|Svrakiss]] originated in Svorden, implying that they once had their own religion that included a heaven. Svrakiss have been integrated into Shu-Dereth as a representation of pure evil, although it's unclear how closely the Derethi version adheres to the original Svordish beliefs.

### Language
Svorden has its own language; because of their rich literary tradition, it is read by educated people in other parts of Sel despite the fact that some people find it difficult to learn. [[Jalla\|Jalla]], who hails from Svorden, speaks the [[Aonic\|Aonic]] language with a thick accent.

### Economy
>‚Äú*That is why you lack the riches and blessings found in nations like JinDo and Svorden.*‚Äù
\-Hrathen[14]


Svorden's people are are relatively wealthy. They have highly skilled tradespeople, including the finest locksmiths in the Empire. Svorden is therefore a lucrative market for trade; despite the long distance to Svorden, merchants in the west utilize trade routes in order to sell goods there.

## Notable Citizens
Jalla is the only person known to hail from Svorden. Notable visitors to Svorden include Lukel, [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]], and [[Sarene\|Sarene]].
