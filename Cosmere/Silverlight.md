**Silverlight** is a city in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], located in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. It is an ancient city that existed in some form long before notable cosmere events such as the [[Reod\|Reod ]] and the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
It is the residing place of [[Khriss\|Khriss]], [[Nazh\|Nazh]], and [[Guyn\|Guyn]]. Some residents hail from other planets, but there are humans who were born and raised in Silverlight, including [[Iyatil\|Iyatil]]. It is a meeting point for [[Worldhoppers\|worldhoppers]] and [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatically aware]] experts, and it is the base of operations for the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]]. Due to the diverse knowledge of its residents, Silverlight has the best parties in the cosmere.
It has several universities; Khriss was involved in the founding of at least one of them. Silverlight scholars are aware of many esoteric facts about various planetary systems in the cosmere. This includes manifestations of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], the locations of [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularities]], the existence of [[Splinter\|Splinters]], and the history and current status of [[Shard\|Shards]]. They seek to learn more about cosmere mysteries that they cannot fully explain, such as the existence of a perpendicularity on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]] or the nature of the [[Evil\|Evil]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]]. As part of their research, they travel throughout the cosmere investigating unusual events and situations, although some people prefer to avoid the more dangerous fields of study. Most people in Silverlight are aware of [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. The universities are in contact with the [[Ire\|Ire]], one of the most cosmere-knowledgeable groups in existence, but the Ire are not always willing to collaborate with Silverlight's scholars.
Residents of Silverlight are known to use silver chains that originate on Threnody, possibly to anchor themselves through [[Cognitive anomaly\|Cognitive anomalies]] while traveling to different planetary systems.
