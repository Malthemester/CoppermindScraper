## Appearance and Personality
Goradel is a young, fair looking man. He has a square jaw and is slightly bald.
He is proud and felt guilty about joining the Lord Ruler, but thought it was necessary in order to survive.
The man usually is in a good temper, although he could get tense after spending more time in [[Urteau\|Urteau]].
According to [[Spook\|Spook]] Goradel could be easily overlooked with his directness and courtly manners, but he is determined, trustworthy and someone to count on. He doesn't like the idea of being sacrificial, but won't let that hinder his dedication.

## History
### Early life
Goradel grew up with his family in Luthadel, but they worked on the fields outside the city. When he couldn't endure the hopelessness of that work any longer, Goradel joined the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] army and was disowned by his family.

### Guard at Kredik Shaw
When [[Vin\|Vin]] infiltrated [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]] on the night of the [[Collapse\|Collapse]] Goradel was on guard outside. Vin could easily have killed him and the other guards, but convinced them to join the rebellion. Goradel was the first of them to rip off his insignia and leave Kredik Shaw.
Somehow Goradel managed to find [[Dockson\|Dockson]] in the chaos of the Collapse, and tells him that Vin is captured by an [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]]. Then [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] is brought in, and he and Goradel team up to rescue Vin out of Kredik Shaw.
Goradel leads Elend and five of the latter's soldiers into the dungeons of Kredik Shaw, where they encounter Vin and [[Sazed\|Sazed]] who have already broken free but are surrounded by at least twenty enemy guards. Goradel, Elend and his soldiers start attacking the guards to distract them from Vin and Sazed, but Vin finds a last flagon with [[Allomancy\|metals]] and deals with the guards in a matter of seconds.

### Siege of Luthadel
During the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]] Goradel was part of the scout squad for undermining activities in Elend's army. He voluntarily answered Elend's call to help keeping the skaa in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] warm. He comes to report to Elend and [[Demoux\|Demoux]] that all of the furniture in abandoned houses is already removed, but that most roofs and inner walls of these buildings are also constructed of wood and can be demolished to burn.

### Coup of Urteau
Meanwhile Goradel was promoted to captain by [[Ham\|Ham]]. He was head and spokesman of the guard that accompanied Sazed, [[Breeze\|Breeze]] and [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]] during their journey to [[Urteau\|Urteau]] and the [[Coup of Urteau\|Coup of Urteau]]. He and his men were responsible for keeping a watch over Sazed, ambassador of the [[New Empire\|New Empire]], guarding their headquarters at the Lord Ruler's storage cavern in Urteau, and make sure that [[Beldre\|Beldre]] wouldn't escape. Whenever possible Goradel kept watch over Sazed personally. After spending more time in Urteau Goradel tended to primarily look to [[Spook\|Spook]] for commands instead of Sazed.

### Messenger
When Spook woke up for the first time after the Coup of Urteau, he told his visitors that he urgently needed to send a message to Vin. Breeze replied [[Brass\|Soothing]] that he should rest, but Goradel offered to deliver the message himself because Vin once spared his life, and thus is willing to risk his life for her. He departed with [[Spook's note\|Spook's note]], which warned her that [[Ruin\|Ruin]] was able to manipulate people who had metal inside of their body.
Somewhere on his way to Vin, the latter being on her way to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], Goradel was approached by [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]] [[Marsh\|Marsh]] who attacked Goradel and his horse. Goradel was already worn out from making his way through the ash, but was still able to offer quite some resistance to Marsh. After failing to pull out the Inquisitor's back spike, he attempted to cut Marsh sinews with a knife he had hidden in one of his boots, but received a fatal kick in the chest upon which Marsh killed him with an axe.
