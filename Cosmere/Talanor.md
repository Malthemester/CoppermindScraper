Talanor only had a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], he did not own a suit of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. As none of the full Shardbearers would accept his challenge to duel for Shards, [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] decided to try challenging Talanor. He felt that Talanor was eager for notoriety, and would accept for the chance to gain prestige, as well as Adolin's Shards. However, it appears that he also denied Adolin's challenge.
