## Geography
Kasitor is located in central Iri, in the northwest corner of the Rosharan continent. The city is situated on a bay, and it is not far from a small mountain range. The climate in Kasitor, like most of Iri, is very warm. It is the second most populous Iriali city‚Äîit has fewer residents than [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]], but more than [[Eila\|Eila]].

## History
[[Axies the Collector\|Axies the Collector]] visited Kasitor as part of his efforts to research and observe [[Spren\|spren]]. He intentionally got drunk while researching [[Alespren\|alespren]] and was beaten and robbed. He woke up nude in an alleyway next to a rather eccentric [[Beggar (Kasitor)\|beggar]]. Axies wrapped himself in a blanket while observing Cusicesh, but that too was stolen, and he was taken to the city's dungeons by some guards.

Kasitor's most well-known feature is a massive [[Spren\|spren]] known as Cusicesh, the Protector. The spren resides in the city's bay. There is a viewing platform at the docks to accommodate the large crowds which congregate daily to observe Cusicesh emerging from the water, occuring at precisely seven forty-six in the morning. Four golden pedestals are also located in the bay where the spren's arms fall into the sea.

## Culture
The residents of Kasitor generally have long, golden hair that signifies pure Iriali blood. They wear minimal clothing due to the warm climate, and paint their exposed skin in various colors and patterns. Although they are not prudish, they are very particular about their chastity laws. They are generally a peaceful people.
The docks in Kasitor contain large ships, indicating that mercantilism is likely part of the local economy. Buildings in Kasitor are often made of bricks.
Cusicesh's presence has an influence on Kasitor's culture. Locals use Cusicesh's daily emergence to adjust their clocks. Though some worship Cusicesh as a god, most simply consider him to be a part of the city. Axies notes that Cusicesh commonly has a "draining" effect on people.
