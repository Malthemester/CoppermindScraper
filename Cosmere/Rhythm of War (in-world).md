**Rhythm of War** is the name [[Navani\|Navani]] and [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] chose to give the shared notebook they maintained, while experimenting with the different [[Lights\|Lights]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It was symbolically named after the [[Rhythm\|Rhythm of War]] to represent Honor and Odium working together, if only for a short time. Raboniel had a copy of this book made for Navani, while the original was sent to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], as she wanted the discoveries made by them to give both sides the tools to finally end the war.
The [[Fused\|Fused]] scholar of human art forms, [[El\|El]], later uses the original notebook to replicate their work, and kills [[Lezian\|Lezian]] permanently to test it out.

|** by  Kelley Harris **|**Navani:** A cracked diamond affixed to the end might give the exact result I am seeking.**Navani:** The metal caps unscrew for versatility in experimentation. **Navani:** A fabrial pump removes the remaining air. **Navani:** The rhythms cause patterns in the sand, different patterns for the different kinds of light. There must be an answer of some kind here, though I wish I could consult a true scholar concerning this.**Undertext (Raboniel):** Now that we have seen where this line of exploration has led, I am amazed that you were able to extrapolate this, Voice of Lights.**Navani:** The tones are becoming easier for me to hear. I recognize the tones of the different kinds of light and struggle to hear if there is something more.**Undertext (Raboniel):** Your research has yielded great fruits. There was a time I thought it impossible for one of your kind to hear the rhythms. How could I have anticipated the magnitude of what you have kept hidden from me? I fear I have underestimated you and your kind.|
|** by  Kelley Harris **|**Navani:** The white gold metal vein down the middle conducts Investiture. Raboniel calls the metal raysium and says there is not enough in this dagger to collect her soul or that of a Herald. I am not sure I believe her.**Undertext (Raboniel):** Navani is right not to believe. I have given her few reasons to trust me, after all, but in this thing I do not lie. Why give into my enemy's hands the means to destroy me?**Navani:** I will proceed with my experiments. Our discovery of Warlight, paired with my eventual understanding of this dagger might yield a way to stop this war.**Undertext (Raboniel):** Though I think we disagree on what an acceptable end to the war actually looks like.**Navani:** The ruby is housed in a metal other than raysium; silver, maybe?**Undertext (Raboniel):** I can confirm: the metal is not raysium but a silver-nickel alloy and does not affect the dagger's function.**Navani:** I suspect the vein of raysium continues through the dagger's hilt and somehow attaches to the ruby at its base.**Undertext (Raboniel):** The raysium vein is removable, reversible, and conducts Investiture directly to the gemstone.**Navani:** Touching the dagger to half of the ruby does not pull out the half spren. Cracking one half, however, allows the spren to escape. The dagger immediately pulls the spren along the raysium vein and into the gem at its base.|

## Excerpts
### From page 1
>“*I find this format most comfortable, as it is how I’ve collaborated in the past. I have never done it in this way, and with this kind of partner.*”
\-Page 1[4]


>“*I approach this project with an equal mixture of trepidation and hope. And I know not which should rule.*”
\-Page 1[5]


>“*I approach this project with inspiration renewed; the answers are all that should matter.*”
\-Page 1, undertext[6]


### From page 3
>“*In my fevered state, I worry I’m unable to focus on what is important.*”
\-Page 3[7]


>“*"When in such a state, detachment is enviable. I have learned that my greatest discoveries come when I abandon lesser connections."*”
\-Page 3, undertext[8]


### From page 5
>“*This song—this tone, this rhythm—sounds so familiar, in ways I cannot explain or express.*”
\-Page 5[9]


>“*I am led to wonder, from experiences such as this, if we have been wrong. We call humans alien to Roshar, yet they have lived here for thousands of years now. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge there are no aliens or interlopers. Only cousins.*”
\-Page 5, undertext[10]


### From page 6
>“*It would have been so easy if Voidlight and Stormlight destroyed one another. Such a simple answer.*”
\-Page 6[11]


>“*We must not let our desires for a specific result cloud our perceptions.*”
\-Page 6, undertext[12]


>“*But how can we not, in searching, wish for a specific result? What scientist goes into a project without a hope for what they will find?*”
\-Page 6, undertext[13]


>“*I find this experience so odd. I work with a scholar from the ancient days, before modern scientific theory was developed. I keep forgetting all the thousands of years of tradition you completely missed.*”
\-Page 6, undertext[14]


### From page 10
>“*This point regarding the Rhythm of War’s emotional influence will be of particular interest to El.*”
\-Page 10[15]


>“*Who is this person? You used no title, so I assume they are not a Fused. Who, then, is El?*”
\-Page 10, undertext[16]


### From page 13
>“*In other circumstances, I would be fascinated by this sand to the point of abandoning all other rational pursuits. What is it? Where did it come from?*”
\-Page 13[17]


>“*I am told that it is not the sand itself, but something that grows upon it, that exhibits the strange properties. One can make more, with proper materials and a seed of the original.*”
\-Page 13, undertext[18]


>“*The sand originated offworld. It is only one of such amazing wonders that come from other lands—I have recently obtained a chain from the lands of the dead, said to be able to anchor a person through Cognitive anomalies. I fail to see what use it could be to me, as I am unable to leave the Rosharan system. But it is a priceless object nonetheless.*”
\-Page 13, undertext[19]


### From page 21
>“*As we dig further into this project, I am left questioning the very nature of God. How can a God exist in all things, yet have a substance that can be destroyed?*”
\-Page 21[20]


>“*I am not convinced any of the gods can be destroyed, so perhaps I misspoke. They can change state however, like a spren—or like the various Lights. This is what we seek.*”
\-Page 21, undertext[21]


### From page 27
>“*Do not mourn for what has happened. This notebook was a dream we shared, which is itself a beautiful thing. Proof of the truth of my intent, even if the project was ultimately doomed.*”
\-Page 27[22]


>“*I leave you now to your own company.*”
\-Page 27[23]


### From the final page
>“*Opposites. Opposites of sounds. Sound has no opposite. It’s merely overlapped vibration, the same sound, but sound has meaning. This sound does, at least. These sounds. The voices of gods.*”
\-Final page[24]


>“*Voice of Lights. Voice for Lights. If I speak for the Lights, then I must express their desires. If Light is Investiture, and all Investiture is deity, and deity has Intent, then Light must have Intent.*”
\-Final page[25]


>“*Intent matters. Intent is king. You cannot do what I attempt by accident. You must mean it. This seems a much greater law than we’ve ever before understood.*”
\-Final page[26]
