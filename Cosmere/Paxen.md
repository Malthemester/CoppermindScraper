**Paxen** is an [[Idris\|Idrian]] slumlord in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is nicknamed the "Gentleman Idrian" and earns a living by running brothels. Despite the [[Austrism\|religious beliefs]] of his homeland of [[Idris\|Idris]], he is comfortable in his fancy, bright clothing and carries a fine cane. He has achieved at least the first [[Heightening\|Heightening]], which is also taboo. Based on his conversation with [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]], he is more concerned about earning money than about supporting the cause of his monarch. While he is not above taking risks for monetary gain, he is also a pragmatist and demands "commitments" from Vivenna before lending his assistance with her plan.

## Relationships
One of [[Denth\|Denth's]] contacts, and former supporter of [[Vahr\|Vahr's]] rebellion, Paxen seems to be very well connected in the Idrian slums. He, along with [[Rira (character)\|Rira]] and [[Ashu\|Ashu]], agrees to meet with Denth and Vivenna to discuss causing unrest in the city. Vivenna hopes that her efforts to stir up trouble will inspire her fellow Idrians in the city and undermine [[Hallandren\|Hallandren's]] attempts to go to war with her homeland.
