**Old Chapps** is a slightly insane fisherman who lives in the [[Idris\|Idrian]] dock slums in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. He has lived in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] at least since he was a teenager.

## History
He did his fishing during the night to avoid paying a tariff. He was occasionally hired by slumlords in the city to weigh down bodies and drop them in the bay. In his youth he sold out his mother out of desire for her apartment, framing her for a theft. He was feebleminded and did not realize that he would subsequently become responsible for paying rent; he still lived in the apartment. After his mother died in prison, Chapps tied rocks to her feet and left her body in the bay.
While fishing one night, he heard a voice in his mind that directed him to a spot on the water. He didnâ€™t think anything of it as the sea often "talks" to him. The voice commanded him to drop his net in a specific location; when he pulled it up, he found a [[Nightblood\|black sword in a silver sheath]] entangled in the net. The sword was able to easily influence Chapps's unstable mind and it asked him if he wanted to destroy evil. Chapps took the sword onshore and cleaned it up. [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] later found Nightblood in a tenement (likely Chapps' apartment) alongside multiple corpses, including that of Chapps.

## Trivia
Brandon cites Old Chapps as an example of an unexpected viewpoint character with a unique voice. He enjoys writing them and tries to include a few in each of his books.
