The **grindings** or **grinding coughs** was a disease on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Symptoms
The symptoms of the grindings were fairly noticeable. Those who were infected with it were stricken with a persistent and horrible sounding cough. They also had an excess of phlegm, and often mumbled feverishly during the night. By the time the symptoms were noticeable, the patient was often past the spreading stage.

## Treatment
The most important element in treating a patient with the grindings was administering a large amount of water or other liquids for a period of five days or so. Preferably the water should have sugar mixed with it. Hydration was crucial. Two handfuls of crushed [[Bloodivy\|bloodivy]] administered every day was also effective.
