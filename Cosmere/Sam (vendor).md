**Sam** is a hotdog vendor who owns a hotdog stand in [[Newcago\|Newcago]]. After [[Steelheart (Epic)\|Steelheart]]’s defeat, Sam opens up his stand again, though he doesn’t get much business. He serves his hot dogs classic Chicago style, loaded with every topping except for ketchup. [[David\|David]] and [[Abraham\|Abraham]] visit his stand and order hot dogs, and Sam gives them half off because of their service to the city.
