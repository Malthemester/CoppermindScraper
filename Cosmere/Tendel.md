Senior Mastrell **Tendel** is a [[Sand mastery\|sand master]] on the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. He is apparently in charge of coordinating the entrance exams for prospective sand masters looking to join the [[Diem\|Diem]].
Tendel, along with Lord Mastrell [[Praxton\|Praxton]], is present for the entrance exam of [[Kenton\|Kenton]], [[Traiben\|Traiben]], and [[Drile\|Drile]]. He is impressed by Drile's power, remarking that it has been years since he has seen a child so powerful. Upon finding out that Drile is [[Reenst Rile\|Reenst Rile's]] son, he remarks that Drile is a "profitable catch in more way than one."  When Kenton is barely able to manifest sand powers, he sympathetically apologizes to Praxton, who brushes off the comment. He, along with most of the Diem was killed by [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] [[DaiKeen\|warrior-priests]] when they attacked a weakened Diem.
