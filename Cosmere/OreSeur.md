**OreSeur** is a [[Kandra\|kandra]] from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
His [[Contract\|contract]] is with [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] at first. He mainly imitates Lord [[Renoux\|Renoux]] and keeps an eye on [[Vin\|Vin]] while she acts as Valette Renoux. Upon Kelsier's death, his contract is passed to [[Vin\|Vin]]. She is angry with him because he knew of Kelsier's plan to die and inspire the skaa to fight, but did not stop it, though OreSeur only acted in accordance with his contract. Eventually, Vin‚Äôs disgust at the idea of a kandra eating humans drives her to order OreSeur to ingest the bones of a wolfhound instead. Mid-transformation, he is secretly killed and replaced by [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]].

His contract is assigned to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] by [[KanPaar\|KanPaar]] even though it would be to act against the Lord Ruler, due to the high price Kelsier was willing to pay for it. Being a rather rebellious member of the Third Generation, OreSeur is one of the few kandra willing to accept this job, and he leaves the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] after a long period of retirement to do it.
Like [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]], he is of the third generation of Kandra and is thus over 700 years old.

## Trivia
Brandon wanted to write a short story from OreSeur's perspective to explore the kandra's motives for taking Kelsier's contract, as well as his feelings after [[Rashek\|Rashek]] was killed.
