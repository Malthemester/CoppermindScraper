The **Allomantic Agreement of '94** is a law regulating the use of [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]. It is in effect as of 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], so it must have been enacted in year 194 or 294 (the apostrophe in the title implies that it was not in year 94).
One of its provisions is the prohibition of using [[Zinc\|Rioters]] for commercial gain, i.e. to influence customers into buying by manipulating their emotions. However, there is no law against paying Allomancers for their services, e.g. Coinshots as couriers or [[Soothing parlor\|Soothing parlors]].
Significant government resources are used to enforce this law, with entire departments watching for violations of it.
