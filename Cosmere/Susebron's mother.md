**Susebron's mother** is a [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] woman living in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] during [[Susebron\|Susebron's]] childhood. She cares for and raises Susebron, reading stories from a book of children's tales, which he later inherits when she is taken away by the priests, as well as teaching him various things, such as the static nature of [[Returned\|Returned]] bodies.
Due to the nature of the God Kings' line of succession, it is possible that she is not Susebron's biological mother, but was simply made queen when an infant returned. However, she is later confirmed to be the real mother of Susebron, and was formerly a poor merchantâ€™s wife from far northern Hallandren. She died at some point during Susebron's life, and he remarks that the way she died is suspicious.
