**Rin** is a captain of [[House Davar\|House Davar's]] guards in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
In 1172, after [[Luesh\|Luesh]] infiltrated the Davar household, an increasingly unhinged [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]] hired new guards including Rin and [[Levrin\|Levrin]]. The new guards, led by Rin, were violent, intimidating, and highly loyal to Lin. [[Balat Davar\|Balat Davar]] remarked that the old guards that the Davar children had grown up with (including [[Beal\|Beal]] and [[Ten\|Ten]]) were more friendly, and that he did not like the new guards; Rin especially frightened Balat.
Balat revealed that he had recently seen [[Helaran\|Helaran]], who had told Balat that he would probably not see him for a long time. Lin subsequently took Rin aside and asked him to travel to [[Valath\|Valath]] to find and assassinate Helaran and bring him his head. Lin promised Helaran's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] to Rin as payment for the deed. [[Malise Gevelmar\|Malise Gevelmar]] overheard the plot and confronted Lin, who began berating her; Lin whispered something else to Rin before he departed.
