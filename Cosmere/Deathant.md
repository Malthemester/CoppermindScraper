**Deathants** are a form of insect native to the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]] islands on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]]. One bite from these yellow creatures is enough to kill a person, even though they are only as small as a pinhead.

## Behavior
They usually live in underground nests that can sometimes be recognized by a bulge in the ground. When something disturbs their nest, they swarm out through cracks in the ground, making an audible hissing noise, and attack the source of the disturbance. Larger nests may have permanent cracks that allow for faster ingress and egress. [[Trapper\|Trappers]] and other students of the Pantheon's dangers know that placing a source of smoke near the nest entrance can inhibit the ants from attacking.
Deathants have some sort of ability to sense mental signatures like other predators in the Pantheon, as [[Dusk\|Dusk]] notes that they would not consider [[Kokerlii\|Kokerlii]] edible. Dusk considers them a constant, deadly nuisance since their small size makes them easy to miss—especially at night—and they are present almost everywhere on [[Patji (island)\|Patji]], including on leaves, branches, and the jungle floor. They can sometimes even infiltrate a trapper's [[Safecamp\|safecamp]], although this is less common.
