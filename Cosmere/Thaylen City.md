## Geography
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] Thaylen City on the map of Thaylenah
Thaylen City is located on the northwestern coast of the largest of the islands forming [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. It sits on the shores of [[Longbrow's Straits\|Longbrow's Straits]], a strip of ocean dividing Thaylenah from the [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] mainland. The city was built inside a massive natural [[Lait\|lait]] to protect it from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. It's also surrounded by mountains, offering additional protection. While the local climate is warmer than in the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] across the Straits, it's still cold, especially at night. Thanks to its location, the city ordinarily suffers only the mildest of stormwinds, but once the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] begins, it's exposed to the full brunt of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].
In [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], Thaylen City can be recognized by the dais of its [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], which sits a little off the shore on the [[Thaylen Sea\|Thaylen Sea]]. A single bridge allows for accessing the dais from land.

 by  Isaac Stewart  A map of Thaylen City
Thaylen City is built on the mountainside and divided into a number of districts, called Wards. The **Ancient Ward**, located in the city's center, is Thaylen's oldest section. It's built out of stone and rises slightly above the surrounding ground, with a street layout following a [[Cymatics\|cymatic]] pattern.
From the west, the Ancient Ward is followed by the **Low Ward**, where numerous businesses and government buildings are located. The Low Ward is bracketed from the west by a long wall going north to south between the mountain slopes. This city wall served as a minor windbreak for those fortunate enough to have lived right by it when the Everstorm arrived. A portion of it was breached during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], though the gap was later filled in with [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] metal by [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]].
Past the city wall lays the area now known as the **Thaylen Field**. Prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], this part of the city was well-developed, with numerous taverns, warehouses and shops. The famous Thaylen docks were located on the shore there, stretching across the southern portion of the peninsula. Unfortunately, the area was not built to withstand violent weather, due to the protection offered by the mountainside. As such, it was swept away by the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], leaving it ruined and empty.
Surrounding the Ancient Ward from north and south are the **North Ward** and the **South Ward**. To the east, the city begins to climb up the mountain slope in a series of tiered terraces called the **Loft Wards**, which climb up to the **Royal Ward**. The Royal Ward is the city's representative sector. It includes numerous palaces and mansions, including the Royal Palace, the seat of the Thaylen monarchs, as well as ten temples dedicated to the [[Herald\|Heralds]] of the [[Almighty\|Almighty]]. Following the Everstorm, those temples were mainly used to house the numerous wounded and homeless citizens.
The city's [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] is located on the same level as the Royal Ward, albeit further north, closer to the oceanside cliffs. A small ramp leads up to it from the city proper. To the east, right past the Royal Palace, a trio of roads departs the city, forming Thaylen's only land connection to the rest of the island.
In the past, the city had a developed system of aqueducts, cisterns and sewers; however, most of it has been torn apart by the first passing of the Everstorm.

### Landmarks
 by  Marie Seeberger  A view of the city from above

The ancient [[Thalath\|Thalath]] Oathgate is located on the northern-eastern edge of Thaylen City, next to the Royal Ward. Back in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch, it would've been beyond the city limits, in contrast to how other major settlement of the era, like [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] and [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]], were arranged. Presently, it has been turned into a sculpture garden, and provides an excellent view of the city. It's eventually unlocked by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Shallan\|Shallan]], who fly there after Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen]] agrees to ally with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]].
While the Oathgate was locked along with all the others, the Thaylens retained some memory of the platform's original purpose. The local folklore refers to it as a "portal of worlds", claiming that only the most [[Passions\|Passionate]] would be able to reopen it. While the story is particularly popular among young girls, the Oathgate holds great religious significance for all the Thaylens.


The Thaylen docks had been one of the city's greatest points of pride before the Everstorm swept them away. They lay outside the fortifications, on the southern part of the shore, taking advantage of a natural bay there. They were constructed primarily of wood, which is why they were so easily destroyed.
The area surrounding the docks had developed over time into a market and warehouse district. A notable feature there was the grand bazaar, a marketplace famous even in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. Unfortunately, as the area was entirely constructed from wood, the Evestorm all but flattened it. This part of the city was eventually renamed to **Thaylen Field**.


Like most largest cities, Thaylenah has ten major temples, each dedicated to one of the [[Herald\|Heralds]]. The temples are all located in the Royal Ward, and when visiting Thaylen, it's traditional to see all of them, which allows the local ruler to show off both the city and its piety. During the True Desolation, the temples are instead used as makeshift hospitals and shelters for people injured and displaced in the Everstorm.
The most notable temples are:

**The Temple of Battah** - located in the northwestern part of the Royal Ward, it's the second-oldest temple in the city. It's particularly notable for the [[Simulacrum of Paralet\|Simulacrum of Paralet]], a massive statue that once adorned the plaza in front of it. The Simulacrum was knocked over by the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], sending large chunks of it into the Loft Wards; Dalinar rebuilds it with his [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] powers upon his first visit to the city.
**The Temple of Ishi** - the oldest temple in the city. It sits in the southern portion of the Royal Ward.
**The Temple of Talenelat** - located in the central part of the Royal Ward, in a stone plaza dedicated to the Herald. A set of steps leads up to an arched enterance, and both the outer and inner walls are covered in mosaics showing Taln standing fast against the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]]. The temple fared poorly against the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], with the entire roof having collapsed from a lightning strike, possibly because [[Odium\|Odium]] targeted it deliberately out of vengeance. It's in the temple of Talenelat that Dalinar discovers his ability to mend buildings; as such, it's the first he fixes.
**The Temple of Pailiah** - located in the north-eastern part of the Royal Ward. It's open, allowing wind to flow through it. [[Renarin\|Renarin]] goes there to pray when he begins seeing visions of the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].

For more information, see [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]].
The Gemstone Reserve is a national bank of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. It's located in the Low Ward, near one of the entrances to the Ancient Ward. The structure is build like a fortress, to protect its contents. It has no windows. Within are numerous vaults storing various gemstones, including some of the largest and most unique ones, like the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]]. People can sell and buy their writs of ownership, allowing them to trade large sums easily.
During the Battle of Thaylen Field, the building is destroyed by a [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]] on orders of Odium, who wants to prevent Dalnar from accessing King's Drop, a [[Perfect gemstone\|perfect gemstone]].


The Court Square is a plaza somewhere in the city; its exact location is unknown, though the name suggests it might be near the Royal Palace. During the Battle of Thaylen Field, it's assaulted by the possessed Amaram soldiers. Initially, it's protected by the highguards [[Hrdalm\|Hrdalm]] and [[Tshadr\|Tshadr]], both in [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]; eventually, Hdralm departs to combat one of the [[Thunderclast\|thunderclasts]] attacking the city while Tshadr remains to hold the Square.

## History
### Heraldic Epochs and Era of Solitude
 by  Isaac Stewart  The ancient Thaylen City; in the present, this part is known as the Ancient Ward
Thaylen City is one of the oldest settlements on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], though its exact origins are uncertain. The modern history dates it as about four thousand years old; however, the existence of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] and the [[Cymatics\|cymatic]] pattern of its appearance suggest that it's much older than that. During the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], it was located in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Thalath\|Thalath]]. Its proximity to the Thalath Oathgate indicates that it might've been the capital even back then. At the time, it was a far smaller city, consisting only of the district now known as the Ancient Ward.
The ultimate fate of Thalath and how it became [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] is unknown. Thaylen City, however, retained its high status, and in the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]] it remained the capital of the newer kingdom, as well as a major shipping and banking hub. It grew far beyond its original constraints, becoming one of the greatest metropoleis of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] alongside cities such as [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] and [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. In the closing years of that age, it came to the attention of people researching [[Dawncities\|Dawncities]], who investigated it due to the cymatic pattern of the Ancient Ward. Among others, [[Kabsal\|Kabsal]] used its perfectly symmetrical shape as a proof of the existence of the [[Almighty\|Almighty]].

### The Everstorm
>‚Äú*We tried to prepare, but a nation cannot upend four millennia worth of tradition at a snap of the fingers. Thaylen City is a shambles, Kholin.*‚Äù
\-Fen Rnamdi[2]


When the [[Listener\|listeners]] summoned the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] tried to warn the various cities of the world, including Thaylen, about the upcoming catastrophe. The Thaylens believed him after confirming his information with [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]], one of the cities struck earlier, and strove to prepare. There wasn't enough time, though, particularly as [[Odium\|Odium]] targeted the city deliberately, both as a strategically-important location and as the stage for his confrontation with Dalinar. The once-extensive docks, along with the entire seaside district, were all but wiped out; most of the city's other Wards were heavily damaged by lightning, strong winds, and even debris falling from the terraces above. The temple of [[Talenelat\|Talenelat]] in particular was wrecked near-utterly, possibly out of grudge Odium might have against Taln for holding out for as long as he had.
Along with the Everstorm came the awakening of the city's [[Parshmen\|Parshmen]] population. While the Thaylen were warned of this, they again didn't have enough time to respond properly. As a result, when the Parshmen awoke, they stole the remaining ships, both the military and private vessels, and sailed away, escaping their former captors. They would later become the crews of the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] fleet.

### Alliance with Urithiru
Dalinar quickly pinpointed Thaylen City as one of the critical locations for the upcoming war. However, when he began to make his overtures of peace to various world leaders, Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen Rnamdi]] initially rejected him, on the grounds that letting [[Alethi\|Alethi]] armies into her capital would essentially surrender her already-weakened country to them. In time, Dalinar managed to convince her to agree, and dispatched [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to reopen the Thaylen City Oathgate.
Later, Dalinar visited Thaylen City personally along with [[Navani\|Navani]] and king [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], and was given a tour of it by Queen Fen. It was then that he discovered his [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] ability to mend broken structures, and began to aid in rebuilding the city, earning respect from the Thaylen. Alongside him, Taravangian's surgeons and [[Renarin\|Renarin]] likewise assisted with handling Thaylen City's copious wounded, further cementing Thaylenah's position in the alliance. Later, the army of the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]], under command of [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]], was sent to the city to assist with the rebuilding.

### Battle of Thaylen Field
For more information, see [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
 by  Ashley Coad  Dalinar confronting Nergaoul on Thaylen Field
Following the revelations of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]], Thaylenah was one of the few countries to remain with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], mostly because they had no other choice in their weakened state. It was then that the Voidbringer armies, led by Odium himself, arrived on the shores of Thaylen City, having sailed there from the nearby country of [[Marat\|Marat]]. Though the defenders attempted to prepare for battle, things changed dramatically when Odium first summoned a pair of [[Thunderclast\|thunderclasts]], and then released [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] upon the Amaram troops, turning them against the people they were supposed to protect.
One of the thunderclasts breached the wall and made for the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]], intending to secure the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]], a [[Perfect gemstone\|perfect gemstone]] that could trap Nergaoul. At the same time, Dalinar went down into the Thaylen Field to face Odium directly. In the ensuing confrontation, Dalinar managed to open [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]], providing the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] present with much-needed [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]].
What resulted was a pitched battle between the defending forces -- mostly the Knights Radiant and Thaylen troops, later reinforced by [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] soldiers brought by [[General Khal\|General Khal]] through the Oathgate -- and Odium's soldiers, consisting of the two thunderclasts, the Amaram army and the [[Fused\|Fused]]. Much of the city was ruined in the process, although the wall was patched by [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] soulcasting the air in the breach into metal. Ultimately, Nergaoul was trapped in the King's Drop and the remaining Voidbringer forces withdrew.
The battle once more left Thaylen City in shambles, now augmented by the corpse of one of the thunderclasts. Massive surgeon stations were set up in the Low Ward to care for the numerous wounded, and the various alliance members pitched in to aid with the rebuilding. However, much work remains to be done, and whether the city can be brought back to its former glory is questionable.

## Politics
>‚Äú*Strategically, Thaylen City is far more important than Jah Keved‚Äîbut at the same time, far worse defended.*‚Äù
\-Dalinar[1]


Thaylen City serves as the center of Thaylen commerce and politics. The reigning monarch resides there; likewise, the various merchant councils, as well as the Thaylen navy, have their headquarters in the city. Its vast port is home to numerous trading and naval vessels. Moreover, the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]] holds vast majority of the country's wealth, allowing for long-distance trade via [[Spanreed\|spanreeds]].
Unfortunately, the city suffered vast losses in the Everstorm, dealing a severe blow its power. The grand docks and warehouses were destroyed; the ships, stolen by the escaping [[Parshmen\|parshmen]]. The Gemstone Reserve was wrecked in the Battle of Thaylen Field, and though majority of the gems contained within appear to have survived, they were scattered across the city, and it's questionable whether the government can retrieve them all. In the present, Thaylen City is all but reliant on [[Alethi\|Alethi]] support to survive the Desolation.
Nonetheless, it remains important. It's one of the few cities with [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] controlled by the people opposed to [[Odium\|Odium]], giving it an instant access to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and allowing the alliance to project power in the South of Roshar. Moreover, the city's location makes holding it crucial to any strategy in the region. Whoever controls Thaylen City controls the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]], and can threaten the entire coast, from [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]] all the way to [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. As such, it's important for the alliance to keep it, which was the main impetus for the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
