**Oroden** is the youngest child of [[Lirin\|Lirin]] and [[Hesina\|Hesina]], and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] baby brother.
Oroden, along with the rest of the people of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]], was sheltered in [[Roshone\|Roshone's]] manor when the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] came to [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Kaladin estimates him to be about a year old when he meets him for the first time. His name means 'child of peace'.

## History
 by  Elisgardor  Having his height measured by [[Hesina\|Hesina]]
For more images, see [[Oroden/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Oroden was relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with the population of Hearthstone, where he lives on the sixth floor with his parents, sleeping in a small closet. Kaladin visits and plays with him at least once.
When Urithiru is assaulted by [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces, Oroden was initially taken care of by a 'village girl', presumably from Hearthstone. Oroden is present when soldiers come to take fallen Radiants from Lirin's care into custody, and begins crying when after Kaladin kills the [[Regal\|Regal]] in protection of [[Teft\|Teft]]. After this, Lirin, Hesina and Oroden are imprisoned in the the clinic, held by [[Lezian\|Lezian's]] guards, and later by [[Leshwi\|Leshwi's]] after [[Venli\|Venli]] intervenes. The family stays together when Lirin and Hesina begin looking after the fallen Radiants.
