**Inis Julien** is a senator from [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Julien was part of a delegation from Elendel that was invited to [[Bilming\|Bilming]] to view the unveiling of new warships known as "[[Pewternaut\|Pewternauts]]". The ships were personally developed by the mayor of Bilming, Lord [[Bastien Severington\|Bastien Severington]]. Julien was subsequently quoted on the front page of *The New Ascendancy* mocking the ships, which he believed to be superfluous. Julien's comments may have have contributed to the resentment of Elendel that Severington later displayed during a speech at [[Kelesina Shores's party\|Kelesina Shores's party]].
