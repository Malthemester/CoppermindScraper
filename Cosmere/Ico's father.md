This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Ico's father** is a [[Deadeye\|deadeye]] [[Lightspren\|lightspren]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He was bonded to a [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] before the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], and was "killed", becoming a deadeye, when his Knight betrayed his oaths.
[[Ico\|Ico]] refers to him as his father, but the nature of familial relationships among spren is not fully understood. Ico keeps him locked in the hold of his ship in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] to keep him from wandering off in an attempt to find the human that wields his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] corpse in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. The fate of his father seems to have made Ico skeptical that a human such as [[Adolin\|Adolin]] could have any true regard for a deadeye spren such as [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]].

## Trivia
Although Ico's father is trapped on his son's ship, he can be summoned as a Shardblade regardless of his location in Shadesmar compared to the location of his wielder in Roshar. There are some minor side effects if they are far apart (such as a slightly longer summoning duration) that may be explored in future books.
