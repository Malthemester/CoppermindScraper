**Melhi** is a [[Liveborn\|Liveborn]] hacker.
She is snubbed by [[Kairominas\|Kairominas]], taking offence at Kai's epiphany of the [[Wode\|Wode's]] steering him into a "perfect battle", and particularly at Kai's refusal to fight her. After this Melhi repeatedly hacks Kai's world and sends robots to fight him. This culminates in the creation of Sophie, a perfect human replica who Kai takes a liking to on a date ordered by the Wode to fulfill [[XinWey's Doctrine\|XinWey's Doctrine]]. She helps him defeat a robot sent by Melhi and then shoots herself under the command of Melhi.
