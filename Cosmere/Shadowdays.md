## Definition and Usage
>“* There are histories from the time when the Radiants lived. That’s not as far back as the shadowdays or the Heraldic Epochs.*”
\- Renarin talking about history[3]


The exact definition of when the shadowdays ended seems uncertain and differs between people. The majority of people seem to accept them as ending after the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]], although it is possible some consider them to extend past that point. [[Renarin\|Renarin]] states that there was a time after the shadowdays when the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] still existed. However, [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] comments that the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] is old enough to nearly be part of the shadowdays.

>“* Legends. The Recreance is an event so old, it might as well be in the shadowdays.*”
\- Dalinar speaking of the Recreance[4]


Based on these comments, it is likely the shadowdays are generally considered to have ended sometime between the Last Desolation and the Recreance.

## Art and Literature
There are very few surviving pieces of artwork or writing from this time, leading to the lack of knowledge about them. Much of the knowledge of that time comes from fragments, such as a copy of a copy of a mosaic. *The Way of Kings* is the only complete text from the shadowdays prior to the translation of the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]], but lost texts like the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] were rediscovered along with the Dawnchant's translation. The carved pillars in the [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]] eastern hall is art surviving from this time.

## Powers and Weapons
One of the hallmarks of the shadowdays are mythical weapons and powers. The [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]] were forged by [[Honor\|Honor]] and used by the [[Herald\|Heralds]] in fighting [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]. The true nature of the abilities of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] during this time are also mythical to most Rosharans, including [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] and glowing [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]].

## Notable People
Notable people who are believed to have lived during the shadowdays include [[Derethil\|Derethil]], a king, and [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]], the writer of *The Way of Kings*.
[[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] also lived during those days, and she is able to recount to [[Navani\|Navani]] what her grandmother told her after seeing the humans first arriving on Roshar from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]].
