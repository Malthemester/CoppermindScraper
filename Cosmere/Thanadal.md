## History
While out on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Thanadal refused to discuss the issue of a joint plateau assault with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], sending a messenger declining the possibility without even meeting him in person. Because he began to be vocal about Dalinar's faults, [[Adolin\|Adolin]] invited Resi to a duel and defeated him, quietly countering the accusations. Later, Adolin dueled [[Salinor Eved\|Salinor Eved]], another of Thanadal's Shardbearers, and won his Blade in a particularly brutal manner during Dalinar's campaign to win the other highprinces' Shards.
After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and the following settling of the tower city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], most of the Alethi [[Highprince\|highprinces]] moved across the Shattered Plains with their war camps in tow. When they vacated the craters they had occupied as well as the surrounding land and resources, they left them for Highprinces Thanadal and [[Vamah\|Vamah]], who had decided not to make the move. Thanadal took advantage of the opportunity to build himself a virtual kingdom of his own in the area. The political implications of Thanadal's refusal to join the others in Urithiru with regards to its subsequent rising power is uncertain. However, [[Highprince of Commerce\|Highprince of Commerce]] [[Turinad Sebarial\|Turinad Sebarial]] worried over Thanadal's continued seizure of Alethi resources on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], and [[Aladar\|Aladar]] expressed worry to Dalinar that without Thanadal's forces joining those at Urithiru, their armies would be too weak to establish Urithiru as the bastion of order he had envisioned.
Thanadal was a member of the Sons of Honor. During the year following the Battle of Thaylen Field he had rose up their ranks and became aware of the group's secrets. The Ghostbloods ultimately assassinated him despite him trying to negotiate.
