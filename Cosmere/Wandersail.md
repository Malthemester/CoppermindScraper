For the Thaylen merchant vessel, see [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail (1174 ship)]].
The *Wandersail* is a legendary ship on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
It was captained by [[Derethil\|Derethil]], who had the ship built to travel through [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. The ship sailed into the open ocean in an attempt to find the origin of the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]]. It was shipwrecked on a ring of islands in the middle of the ocean that surrounded a giant whirlpool "where, it is said, the ocean drains".
Derethil and his men met a people known as the [[Uvara\|Uvara]], or the People of the Great Abyss. The crew of the *Wandersail* were welcomed by the Uvara, and the ship was repaired in their shipyards. Eventually, Derethil and the crew uncovered some disturbing aspects of Uvara society and quickly left the islands on the *Wandersail*, using the momentum of the whirlpool to get them away from it. They were accompanied by a single Uvara woman named [[Nafti\|Nafti]].

## Historicity
The story of Derethil and the *Wandersail* is told to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] by [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. Hoid answers cryptically when Kaladin questions the story's authenticity, and it may contain some elements of truth.
The tale is known in [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]], as [[Vstim\|Vstim]] gifts a [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|newly built ship]] named after the *Wandersail* to his former apprentice [[Rysn Ftori\|Rysn Ftori]]. Rysn considers the story of the original *Wandersail* nothing more than a fanciful myth, while Vstim believes in the message of the story, if not the specifics.
