**Aonic** is the term used to refer to an ethnic group that exists on the planet [[Sel\|Sel]]. The Aonic people migrated to the region surrounding [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] several thousand years before the [[Reod\|Reod]] occurred. Aonic people are more lighter skinned than people from [[JinDo\|JinDo]], with people from [[Duladel\|Duladel]] in between, since they're a mix of Aonic and JinDo. Most people in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and [[Teod\|Teod]] are of Aonic descent. They look similar for the most part, although the Teos tend to be taller than people from Arelon, and [[Sarene\|Sarene]] (who was from Teod) had light hair, as opposed the average brown hair in Arelon.

## Elantris
Only people who are of Aonic descent can be taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] and become [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]]. The precise reason for this is unknown as Elantris predates the arrival of the Aonic people. They are generally followers of [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]].
