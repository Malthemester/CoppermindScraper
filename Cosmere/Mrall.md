## Appearance and Personality
Mrall is a thick-armed, Thaylen man who shaves his head and eyebrows. He claims that he can simply turn off emotions and stop feeling a certain way, but is still awed by the level of destruction caused by the war they created in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. He also considered [[Valam\|Valam's]] request for his bastard son to kill him cruel.
He is no scholar but is a full participant in the Diagram organization. He believes in the cause and is not afraid to speak his mind.  He is very supportive of the methods used by his organization to "save what they can" from [[Odium\|Odium]], and considers themselves "the only victors of the day" when Taravangian is received in Jah Keved with cheers.

## Attributes and Abilities
Mrall has a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings and experience commanding guards. Though not a scholar, members of the Diagram take his opinions on their course of action into consideration.

## History
Once, on the day that Taravangian solved [[Fabrisan\|Fabrisan's Conundrum]], Mrall had to have Taravangian locked up because Taravangian believed that it was reasonable to draft a law requiring all citizens below average intelligence commit suicide for the good of Kharbranth.

>‚Äú*Do you realize that the Eighty‚Äôs War between Emul and Tukar has lasted six years, and hasn‚Äôt produced nearly this level of desolation? Jah Keved ate itself in a matter of months!*‚Äù
\-Mrall to Taravangian at their arrival to Vedenar[1]

Mrall accompanied Taravangian to [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] after the [[Veden civil war\|Veden civil war]] where Taravangian gained control of the Veden throne. When [[Szeth\|Szeth]] arrived to confront Taravangian, Mrall had his guards separate Taravangian from the Veden soldiers so Taravangian would not be associated with the Assassin in White. Mrall made excuses, claiming the king was old and overcome with grief. Mrall then brought Taravangian to see [[Highprince\|Highprince]] Valam on his deathbed.
When the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] discovered [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Mrall accompanied Taravangian and other key members of the Diagram as they took up residence in the tower city. On a day of notable brilliance in Urithiru, Mrall had to revise his original restrictions on Taravangian, after [[Adrotagia\|Adrotagia]] realized he had cheated the test. Mrall was later disturbed to see that Taravangian had made changes to the [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]].

>‚Äú*You‚Äôre being thrown away! After all you‚Äôve done, Odium casts you aside? At least go to Jah Keved.*‚Äù
\-Mrall to Taravangian before his departure[5]

After [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] did not yield to Odium at the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Mrall questioned the Diagram's accuracy, concerned that it might be flawed. Prior to Taravangian's meeting with Odium, he suggested drafting a change of plan.
When Taravangian left Urithiru to go with the Coalition‚Äôs forces in [[Emul\|Emul]], planning to betray them and be captured, Mrall was greatly saddened. He wept openly as Taravangian prepared to leave, and didn‚Äôt like that Taravangian was separating himself from the Diagram and disbanding the group. Mrall didn‚Äôt want to abandon Taravangian to his fate, and felt that Taravangian‚Äôs life was being thrown away. Taravangian explained his reasoning briefly, and Mrall bid him farewell with a firm handshake and a hug.

## Relationships
### Taravangian
>‚Äú*Do you accept this assessment and these restrictions, Your Majesty?*‚Äù
\-Mrall to Taravangian[1]

Mrall is Taravangian's bodyguard, but the king also considers him one of his closest and most loyal friends. Not only is he close to the King himself, but is the final adjudicator of his daily capacity. He is the one to decide what tasks he would be allowed to do without supervision, based on daily tests and the elderly man's behavior.

### Adrotagia
Adrotagia trusts Mrall and seems to be his confidant when it comes to Taravangian's state and decisions. They also seem to be friends.
