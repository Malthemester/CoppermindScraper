**Kurdon** is a burly taskmaster at the [[Tresting plantation\|Tresting plantation]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].

## History
In 1022 [[Final Empire\|FE]], Lord [[Themos Tresting\|Themos Tresting]] surveyed his fields and was disquieted to see a [[Skaa\|skaa]] in the southern section of the plantation give him a defiant look and then seemingly disappear ([[Kelsier\|Kelsier]]). Tresting summoned Kurdon and ordered him to work the skaa in that section harder, although he did not reveal the true reason due to the presence of a visiting [[Obligator\|obligator]]. Tresting told Kurdon to beat a few of the skaa at random, and Kurdon nonchalantly obliged, as he held no regard for skaa.
That night, Kelsier killed Kurdon, Tresting, and the rest of the plantation's staff while rescuing [[Jess\|Jess's]] daughter; he also burned the manor to the ground.
