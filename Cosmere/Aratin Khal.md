## Appearance and Personality
Aratin is lighteyed, and is at least in his mid-thirties. He has a very muscular physique, with a head that appears almost too small for his body. Aratin has a noticeable gap in his teeth that is visible when he smiles. While wrestling, Aratin goes shirtless with traditional vehah leggings, and presumably wears a [[Takama\|takama]] after his bouts.
Having been raised in a prominent Alethi family, Aratin is capable of polite, formal speech with other lighteyes of a high [[Dahn\|dahn]]. He can be informal when given permission, however. His father taught him to respect but not fear his superiors, and he is willing to wrestle [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] without worrying about hurting him.

## Attributes and Abilities
The Khal family is a linchpin of the Kholin army; Aratin's father is a general, his mother is a prominent scribe and politician that participates in military strategy, and his brothers are both captains. Aratin's rank is unclear, but he is well known to Dalinar.
Aratin is extremely strong and an accomplished traditional vehah wrestler, often winning difficult bouts. In late 1173, he went on a winning streak, remaining undefeated for at least several months into the next year.

## History
Aratin was born the second son of General Khal and Teshav, after [[Halam\|Halam]] but before [[Meleran\|Meleran]]. General Khal played a large role in raising Aratin, teaching him how to treat his superiors. Aratin presumably lived on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] and traveled to Urithiru through the [[Narak\|Narak]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] during or after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. He often wrestled in a large training room near the quarters of the Kholin soldiers in the tower.
In early 1174, Aratin was challenged to a wrestling match by Dalinar Kholin, who had become restless waiting for a dueling partner. Aratin warned Dalinar that he had not lost a match in months, but happily agreed to the contest. Aratin managed to trip Dalinar over his hip and tried to put him in a chokehold on the ground. Dalinar managed to wriggle free of the chokehold, but Aratin grabbed him under the arms and pressed his face to the mat, pinning Dalinar. Dalinar tried to break free of Aratin's grip by arching his back and twisting, putting pressure on Aratin's shoulders as he held Dalinar down. Aratin seemed to start slipping, but the match was interrupted by [[Navani\|Navani]]. Dalinar raised a fist and bowed to Aratin, congratulating him on his victory; Aratin told him that it had been an honor. Once the duel was over, Aratin's friends came over to congratulate him on his victory, and he winced and held his shoulder when one slapped him on the back. Dalinar realized that Aratin had held the advantage and he should have given up sooner to avoid any injuries.
