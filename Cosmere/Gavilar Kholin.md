## Appearance and Personality
 by  Grant M. Hansen 
>‚Äú*My husband was an excellent king, (...) but he didn't have a single scholarly finger on his left hand. (...) He was a man built after the classical masculine ideal.*‚Äù
\-From Navani's biography of Gavilar[5]


For more images, see [[Gavilar Kholin/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Gavilar looks regal with his beard combed, glowing gemstones on the fingers and a uniform of newer styles. He has strong features, a square chin, a black beard with a hint of white, and pale green eyes. He has a set of bright blue Shardplate, which he often lends to others in favor of wearing a modern suit, and wears a black iron circlet as crown.
He's an ambitious man who is obsessed with the rise of House Kholin and overshadowing the Sunmaker and his legacy. He wants to lead a sustainable kingdom and doesn't overlook responsibility. He is very knowledgeable of history; he has theories on why Sunmaker‚Äôs kingdom did not stand as well as knowledge on the history of some blades including Oathbringer that would eventually be Dalinar's. He is known for his political skill for making alliances and is more inclined to trick his enemies into turning against each other, though he doesn‚Äôt feel guilty if his strategy included pillaging or brutal killing, as his best friend and trusted adviser Torol Sadeas would push for. He had a tendency to use those around him, even if he cared for them.
If he was still alive, Gavilar would be proud of some aspects of Dalinar and less proud of others; for example, he would think Dalinar not ambitious enough.
In his youth, he had a habit of summoning and dismissing his Blade when getting ready for a battle, perhaps as a way to relieve stress. It's unknown if he retained it in his middle age.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Shardwielding
Gavilar's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], [[Firestorm\|Firestorm]], was six feet long with a design along the blade that resembled burning flames that "almost seemed to glow." Gavilar's plate is painted blue with gold bands around the edge of each plate. The helm has three waves of wings which are small and almost horn-like. People who see his plate consider it beautiful. Gavilar's skill in using the blade and plate can be matched by very few people. Gavilar's Shards are now used for training purposes.

### Visions
For more information, see [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]].
Sometime before his death, Gavilar begins receiving [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] from the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] during every [[Highstorm\|highstorm]]. These visions feel real to him. He experiences them as himself, but other people in the visions see him as someone else, not as an outsider. At the end of every one of them, Gavilar hears the voice of [[Honor\|Honor]] speaking to him, commanding him to "unite them." As the visions are pre-recorded, Gavilar cannot communicate with Honor. Much like his brother, he was on the path of becoming a [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]], but unlike Dalinar, he never reached that stage.

## History
### Early Life
 by  botanicaxu  Young Gavilar and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]
Gavilar and Dalinar were born into a provincial branch of the Kholin family. His mother died when he and his brother were young, and his father was absent from his life and spent his time dueling. After their father suffered a permanent head injury in a duel, Gavilar took over a paternal role for his younger brother Dalinar, teaching him things like how to shave. Gavilar was only fourth dahn, and not considered a serious contender for highprince. He conquered the [[Kholin princedom\|Kholin princedom]], killing some of his relatives and taking the title of highprince for himself. From the start, Gavilar was supported by his brother. Dalinar would often introduce Gavilar to people he felt Gavilar should know. This led to some confusion when Gavilar was introduced by his brother Dalinar to [[Navani\|Navani]]. Dalinar introduced them because he wished to court Navani himself, but Gavilar believed Dalinar intended him to court Navani with the introduction.

### Unification of Alethkar
[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] remembers the beginning of the war as he and Gavilar wanting "stuff" that others had and fighting to get the "stuff." Gavilar never refuted that story at the beginning, but, by around the time of the battle on Rathalas, he was looking more towards building a kingdom that would mean something. This seems to be connected to the birth of his first child [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]].
Gavilar, Sadeas and Dalinar led the war. Gavilar claimed the throne and made alliances; [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] dealt with problems; and Dalinar won battles. Gavilar was more inclined for a strategy that would turn the highprinces against each other. Sadeas, however, pulled him towards brutality; he did not seem to be concerned if his troops pillaged a city. It is implied that the war was very long and bloody, but Gavilar eventually won it after the defeating Highprince Kalanor, who was pushed into battle after Gavilar's forces pillaged his villages and killed all peacemakers.
Towards the end of the war, Gavilar started talking of the [[Alethi Codes of War\|Alethi Codes of War]], likely after he started receiving [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] from the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]].

### Ruling Alethkar
>‚Äú*He is exactly what we need ... Hard enough to lead a war; soft enough to be beloved during peace. He has foresight and wisdom.*‚Äù
\-Sadeas on Gavilar[22]

After winning the war, Gavilar took the throne as King of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. Gavilar did prove to be a proficient leader; he made sure the vision was towards a unified kingdom, and politics were the main tool for doing so. He wanted to ensure Elhokar would be able to hold it together without need of "putting out fires."
He was not soft, but approached things differently, using propaganda, talking to heirs of the highprinces on civic projects, censuring Dalinar and Sadeas on losing the Rift, and even the initial approach towards rebels, trying to scare them by fighting on the borders. Some highprinces considered this softness or weakness, yet he could be hard; some examples are his disappointment on knowing Dalinar had spared the heir of [[Tanalan\|Tanalan]] or the way he talked of attacking [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]] or [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]].
It was during this time that he was most committed to the Codes of War. He talked of the Radiants as truly great when Alethkar was looked up to.

### Gavilar and the Listeners (1165 - 1167)
>‚Äú*We live without honor, for your gods once brought ours. Without them, we have no power. This world is trapped, Eshonai! Stuck in a dull, lifeless state of transition. Unite them. I need a threat. Only danger will unite them.*‚Äù
\-Gavilar to Eshonai[3]


In approximately 1165, Gavilar and Dalinar made an expedition to the south of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] where they discovered the [[Listener\|listeners]], referred to by the humans as Parshendi. Dalinar, while scouting at a campsite, was the first to meet them. Although the other members of the expedition initially did not believe tales of intelligent parshmen, [[Eshonai\|Eshonai's]] group came to the camp the next day. At first they couldn't believe parshmen could live on their own, but they found that these parshmen were friendly, curious and learned the Alethi language quite easily. Gavilar's [[Stormwarden\|stormwardens]] began calling them Parshendi. Although Gavilar had never before been scholarly, he grew more and more fascinated by the Parshendi. Despite Dalinar's attempts to return to Alethkar, Gavilar wanted to stay on the Shattered Plains to learn more about the Parshendi. Gavilar's officers thought the Parshendi were savages, but Gavilar thought the Parshendi were "an enclave of memories. A window into the past."
It's unknown why Gavilar made the treaty with the Parshendi. Many people believe it was because he knew the listeners had shardblades, but as a member of the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]], Gavilar wished to start a Desolation to return the Heralds. He believed bringing back the Parshendi's old gods would benefit both the Parshendi and the humans, despite [[Eshonai\|Eshonai's]] insistence that the Parshendi abandoned their gods. Even while witnessing her horror, he believed the Parshendi would be pleased that the Alethi were allies in seeking the return of their old gods.

### Assassination (1167)
For more information, see [[Assassination of Gavilar\|Assassination of Gavilar]].
The night of his assassination, Gavilar was attending a feast celebrating a treaty with the listeners. Before the feast he spoke in the lower palace floor with five people, including [[Amaram\|Amaram]] and [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]]; in his conversation with Taravangian, he discussed the [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] he had been seeing and warned the other king that a storm was coming. When he discovered that [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] had seen the meeting, he decided to speak to her about his plans. Gavilar wanted to bring back the listeners' gods, the [[Unmade\|Unmade]], and start a new [[Desolation\|Desolation]]. Despite Eshonai's protests to the contrary, he believed this would benefit everyone, including the listeners. He then gave Eshonai a [[Black sphere\|black sphere]] and asked her to take it to [[The Five\|The Five]] and tell them what he had told her.
At some point during the feast, Gavilar slipped into the hallway to speak privately with Amaram. It is not known what they discussed. His daughter, Jasnah, found them talking. He rebuked her for her contempt for the party and expressed an interested that she and Amaram become closer acquainted. When Amaram left, Gavilar refused to tell Jasnah what they were discussing and went back into the party.

>‚Äú*Tell‚Ä¶tell my brother‚Ä¶he must find the most important words a man can say‚Ä¶.*‚Äù
\-Gavilar's last words[1]

When Gavilar learned that [[Szeth\|Szeth]] was in the palace to assassinate him, he put on his [[Shardplate\|shardplate]] and prepared to act as a bodyguard while Sadeas prepared to act as the fleeing king. Szeth initially fell for it, fighting him and leaving to pursue Sadeas after he temporarily incapacitates Gavilar. When Gavilar does not follow Szeth, however, Szeth realizes the ruse. he returns and continues fighting Gavilar. Gavilar's helm was shattered and his plate was damaged, but he managed to injure Szeth by punching his face. In order to finish the fight, Szeth lured Gavilar onto the balcony and broke it using [[Lashing\|lashings]].

 by  Thorkild Skov  Gavilar fighting [[Szeth\|Szeth]]
A piece of wood gravely injured him by stabbing him in the side where his plate was damaged. As he was dying, Gavilar had a small, strange [[Black sphere\|black sphere]] that he gave to Szeth and told him not to let some unknown group get it. He wished his brother to know the "most important words a man can say". Szeth then proceeded to write in Alethi those words in Gavilar's blood on a wooden block, which was later deciphered by [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]]. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] then took this to mean the words of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].
At the end of his life, he believed he was being watched. Gavilar expected an attempt on his life, but not by the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. His suspects included [[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar]], [[Restares\|Restares]], and [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], despite being on apparent good terms with Sadeas at the time. The Parshendi ordered his assassination because he was going to bring back their old gods, but he never became aware of this reason.

### Legacy
>‚Äú*Gavilar the Majestic, first king of Alethkar in the new Kholin Dynasty, thirty-second highprince of the Kholin princedom, heir of the Sunmaker and blessed of the Almighty. His accomplishments will be lauded by all, and his dominion extends to the hereafter.*‚Äù
\-Spoken at Gavilar's holy interment[4]


At Gavilar's holy interment, he was lauded by the presiding ardent. His body was Soulcast into a stone sculpture. At the interment, the Alethi highprinces swore the [[Vengeance Pact\|Vengeance Pact]] and would go on to fight the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] to avenge his death.
A number of works about Gavilar's life exist, including "Gavilar's Account", dictated by Gavilar to Jasnah a year before his murder; "Matain's account"; and "King Gavilar Kholin, A Biography" by Navani. Navani's biography crafted Gavilar a selective legacy, leaving out his abusive, dismissive treatment of her and his family so only she would have to bear the burden of who he really was.

## Relationships
### House Kholin
>‚Äú*You have no fame, accomplishment, or capacity of your own. Everything distinctive about you came from someone else.*‚Äù
\-Gavilar to Navani[28]


There is not much information on Gavilar's family dynamics, but there are hints of complex relationships. Gavilar feels strong affection for his brother [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], but he tends to use people around him as tools to further his goals. Although he and his wife Navani were once close and plotted the conquest of Alethkar together, when Navani talks with passion on her spren research, Gavilar simply ignores her. Later in life as Gavilar develops larger goals, he stops including Navani in his plans. He leaves her to handle the public-facing duties of the monarchy alone and repeatedly tells her she is worthless. A few suggestions of Gavilar's relationship with his children exist. Dalinar references Gavilar's problems with young Jasnah and what he describes as her lunacy. Jasnah herself mentioned a childhood disease nobody remembered. Jasnah spends a lot of time with Gavilar discussing the Parshendi, and later says it was a rare time when she truly connected with him. Though she seems to respect his opinion, Gavilar often treats Jasnah as part of his legacy rather than a person, ignoring her resistance to marrying Amaram and demanding she follow the Vorin church in spite of her convictions. At this point in his life Gavilar has a low opinion of Elhokar, telling Navani he is not even capable of mediocrity. Many of his dismissive feelings toward his family are likely masked, kept out of his interactions with them. After his death most of the Kholins have remember him positively and even revere him. Dalinar refuses to allow criticism of Gavilar and devotes himself to protecting Elhokar, the remaining piece of his brother. Jasnah takes great interest in the changes near the end of his life. Elhokar remembers him as a perfect king Elhokar will never live up to, so dislikes when Gavilar is mentioned. Only Navani sees the darker side of his character, and she hides it, writing him a legacy of being the ideal Alethi man.

### Sadees the Sunmaker
>‚Äú*Hopefully my accomplishments won‚Äôt be as ephemeral as his.*‚Äù
\-Gavilar to Toh in reference to the Sunmaker.[6]


During his conquests and reign, Gavilar looked towards the [[Sunmaker\|Sunmaker]] for guidance. Although the Sunmaker is revered by most in Alethkar for creating a united empire, Gavilar has a more negative view of him. Gavilar blames the destruction of the Sunmaker's empire on his greed and inability to be satisfied with what he conquered. Gavilar hopes that he'll be able to create a longer-lasting empire and overshadow the Sunmaker in the minds of the people. Despite his criticisms of the Sunmaker, Gavilar is willing to use his connection to him to his advantage. For example, Gavilar did not wish to wear a crown because the Sunmaker refused to.

### Sons of Honor
Although Gavilar was not in charge of the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]], he was an influential member of the group. He was responsible for an expansion in the ranks of members, including bringing in [[Amaram\|Amaram]]. He was an important enough member to have access to and knowledge of their plan to return the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]], including the black spheres. Despite this, Gavilar suspected [[Restares\|Restares]], leader of the Sons of Honor, of his assassination, indicating that there might have been some conflict or suspicion between the two.

## Trivia
In *The Way of Kings Prime*, Gavilar went by the name Nolhonarin. Much like Gavilar, Nolhonarin dies before the story proper begins.
