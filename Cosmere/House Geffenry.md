**House Geffenry** is a noble house on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].

## History
They were allied with [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]], although they desired a stronger alliance and access to Tekiel's canal routes across the eastern plains.
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] murdered Tekiel ally [[Charrs Entrone\|Charrs Entrone]] and dumped his body in the gardens of [[Keep Tekiel\|Keep Tekiel]] after Entrone had been gambling against [[Crews Geffenry\|Crews Geffenry]], a known [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]]. Kelsier did not know or care whether the nobility would end up blaming House Geffenry, Tekiel enemy [[House Izenry\|House Izenry]], or some other house for Entrone's death; he just wanted to cause chaos and house wars.
According to [[Kliss\|Kliss]], House Tekiel came to believe that House Geffenry had secretly murdered Entrone in the hopes that his death would make Tekiel nervous and potentially more willing to strengthen the Tekiel-Geffenry alliance. Kliss and [[Milen Davenpleu\|Milen Davenpleu]] suspect that Tekiel then ordered the killing of [[Ardous Geffenry\|Ardous]] and [[Callins Geffenry\|Callins Geffenry]] in retaliation.
