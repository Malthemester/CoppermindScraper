**Leggers** are small to mid-sized crustaceans native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They have long, thick bodies supported by dozens of pairs of spindly, spinelike legs. They also have hairlike spines used to sense wind strength and direction that they can raise and lower. Kaladin was surprised to see a deep purple one while travelling with [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv's]] caravan.
