The **True Desolation** follows the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. [[Odium\|Odium]] and his servants wage war against the rest of Roshar, hoping to eventually allow the [[Shard\|Shard]] to break free of the ties bonding him to the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]].

## Lead-up
After the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]], nine of the ten [[Herald\|Heralds]] could no longer bear to return to [[Braize\|Braize]] to be tortured by the [[Fused\|Fused]], and instead gave up the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. One Herald, [[Talenel\|Talenel]], had been killed in the final battle and had automatically returned to Braize; with him there, the Oathpact remained intact and the Fused were sealed away. They also left behind the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] to continue to protect the people of Roshar.
Around the time of the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]], the newest generation of Radiants learned that humans were not native to Roshar and had essentially been taking the [[Singer\|singers']] land for millennia. Around this time, something—possibly [[Melishi\|Melishi]] trapping the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]]—caused the singers to be stripped of their [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]], leaving them mostly unable to act for themselves. [[Honor\|Honor]] did not support the Radiants through these events, instead raving about how they would destroy Roshar. As a result, all of the Knights Radiant except the [[Order of Skybreakers\|Order of Skybreakers]] broke their [[Immortal Words\|oaths]], killing their [[Spren\|spren]] in an event known as the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Some time after this, Odium finally [[Splinter\|Splintered]] Honor, though not before Honor was able to make some arrangements to guide the people of Roshar through the coming fight with Odium.

>“*Unite them. The sun approaches the horizon. The Everstorm comes. The True Desolation. The Night of Sorrows.*”
\-Honor during one of Dalinar's visions[4]

Sometime prior to the reunification of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] began sending the [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] that Honor had recorded to potential [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Bondsmiths]] to warn them of Odium's coming, guide them to refound the Knights Radiant, and encourage them to unify Roshar against the threat of Odium and his armies. [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] received these visions prior to his death and, shortly thereafter [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] began to receive them as well. The spren were also aware of Odium's impending return and a few Radiant spren began to return to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] to bond with potential Radiants.
The [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] collected a [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattle]] that predicted the coming of the True Desolation. When confronted about his knowledge, [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] told Dalinar that the information came from the Herald [[Battar\|Battar]].

## Beginning
>“*Who am I? I ... I am Talenel'Elin, Stonesinew, Herald of the Almighty. The Desolation has come. Oh, God ... it has come. And I have failed.*”
\-Talenel upon arriving in Kholinar[7]


The True Desolation formally began due to unknown reasons, four and a half millennia after the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], allowing the Fused to return to Roshar. The Herald [[Talenel\|Talenel]] then returned to Roshar to warn the people of their coming and prepare them to fight, arriving outside of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. Upon entering the city, he proclaims that the Desolation has come and that he has failed, before falling to the ground, unconscious. Talenel is later brought to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] where he is widely viewed as a madman. He repeats the same mantra warning of the coming desolation.
Meanwhile, some [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] were laying the groundwork for the Fused to return. One, [[Ulim\|Ulim]], successfully made contact with the singer [[Venli\|Venli]], who was researching new forms to help the [[Listener\|listeners]] fight the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] against the Alethi. With significant help from Ulim, Venli discovered stormform. Though [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] worried about that stormform would open the listeners up to their gods, she volunteered to take the form as a test of its nature and abilities. She is unable, however, to control the form and, with Venli's assistance, convinced most of the rest of their people to adopt it as well. During the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], the stormform singers used its power to summon a new storm of Odium, known as the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. Much like the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], it continually rounds the planet, though in the opposite direction. It restored Connection and Identity to the singers and allows the Fused to be reborn in the body of a singer as it passes over a region.
