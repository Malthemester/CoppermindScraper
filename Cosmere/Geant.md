**Geant** is a nation located on the continent of [[Sycla\|Sycla]] (also known as Opelon) on [[Sel\|Sel]]. During the [[Late Era\|Late Era]], it is under the domain of the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]].
Geant lies at the eastern edge of the Fjordell Empire. It borders [[Svorden\|Svorden]] to the north, [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] to the northwest, [[Hraggen\|Hraggen]] to the west, and [[Hrovell\|Hrovell]] to the southwest. The eastern side of the country is coastal, and unclaimed desert lies to its south. A large river defines most of its northern and western border, and a second river crosses the southern part of the country. Based on available maps, the largest city and presumed capital appears to be [[Velf\|Velf]], which lies on the northern river border with Svorden.
Since Geant is part of the Fjordell Empire, the official religion is [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]]. Unlike Svorden, Geant has not maintained a national identity; it no longer has its own language and the residents speak Fjordell.
