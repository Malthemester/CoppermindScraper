**Rick O'Shea** is an  [[Epic\|Epic]] that can make objects unstable through touch, which then explode under any significant impact. A gauss gun, which [[Abraham\|Abraham]] purchased from [[Diamond\|Diamond]], replicated his power by charging up a bullet and turning it into an exploding projectile. Diamond says he is a standard kinetic energy Epic.
Abraham dislikes this Epic's name due to it being a pun on the French word ricochet, comparing it to "something Cody would say."
[[David Charleston\|David Charleston]] notes that Rick O'Shea was a newer Epic, and so wasn't one of the Epics in the old days that was imprisoned and experimented on. David wonders, then, if such research still occurs.
