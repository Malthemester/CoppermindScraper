## History
In the year 2071 a failing phone company called Northern Bell Incorporated invested in developing [[Cytonics\|Cyto]], a cybernetic-based telepathic linking. The few signals that they managed to get through the system attracted the attention of the [[Tenasi\|tenasi]]. When the United Governments military accidentally shot down the tenasi ambassadorial ship, the PC brokered the [[Tenasi Agreement\|Tenasi Agreement]] in exchange for complete autonomy and a monopoly on FTL technology.
After negotiating the Tenasi Agreement, they were the only group of humans with cytonic capabilities or technology, and the de facto controllers of access to it. Additionally, aliens refused to deal with humanity except through the Phone Company.
Though the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] keeps humans contained and [[Earth (Skyward)\|Earth]] has vanished, they managed to maintain their existence through the [[Human wars\|Human Wars]].
