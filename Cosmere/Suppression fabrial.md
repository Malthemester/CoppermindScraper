A **Suppression fabrial** is a diminisher fabrial that can suppress [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].

## Appearance and Functionality
Suppression fabrials appear as a gemstone covered in metal pieces, and can be given tripod legs. They can be made from [[Sja-anat\|Enlightened]] [[Spren\|spren]], and are given [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] to function. They have a short range, roughly the size of a room.
Suppression fabrials have the ability to suppress a [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant's]] abilities. This is done by twisting the gemstone at the base to activate it. When in use, the Radiant will feel a smothering sensation and their [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] will be unavailable to them. They will also be unable to summon their spren as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. Presumably, they can be inversed to stop [[Fused\|Fused]] from Surgebinding.
Most suppression fabrials are lesser versions and prototypes compared to the one the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] uses.

## Sibling
For more information, see Sibling.
>“*It feels like that fabrial I found in Hearthstone. But it’s obviously on a much grander scale, and more powerful, if it’s knocking out Radiants. The one I faced must have been some kind of prototype.*”

The Sibling has a large suppression fabrial built into [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], much more powerful than a normal one. It is built into a construction of garnets and destroying them will remove its effects. It normally incapacitates Fused, [[Regals\|Regals]], and [[Unmade\|Unmade]] while inside its range. Some of the Unmade are able to resist the effects, as well as other highly Invested individuals. This fabrial can have varying power levels, from merely stopping some of the Fused from Surgebinding to knocking them unconscious. When in effect, [[Rhythm\|rhythms]] are disrupted.


If the Sibling is corrupted, the suppression fabrial can be inverted, instead incapacitating Radiants. While in effect, Radiants inside of the range (roughly hundreds of yards from the tower) will fall unconscious. Their spren will also be pushed back into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], put into a deep sleep-like state. Those who have bonded a dead Shardblade will be unable to summon it, though an unbonded one will remain unaffected.
If a Radiant is far enough in their [[Immortal Words\|oaths]], they may be able to resist the effects, as well as keep their spren in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. Those able to resist will instead feel an external oppressive pressure of darkness. They are still able to take in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and it will continue to heal them. The worse the corruption of the Sibling, the weaker the healing gets. If a Radiant is also a Regal, they will be mostly unaffected by the suppressor, even at the First Ideal. Those using an [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] will still be able to Surgebind and summon their blade.
Fabrials will stop working while inside the range of the suppressor fabrial. Fabrials made from Enlightened spren will still work, but only with Voidlight. The [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] remain unaffected, and can still be used by an Honorblade.
