**Lakstone** is a mineral mined on [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. It is used to make [[Lak\|lak]], the currency used in [[Lossand\|Lossand]]. It's metallic silver in appearance, and can be broken down into small shards.
[[Delius\|Delius]] once financed a lakstone mine at [[Vey\|Vey's]] suggestion, hoping to make a fortune. He eventually went bankrupt and had to sell the mine to Vey, who hit a seam of lakstone only a week later. The profits from the mine were enough to make him the Lord Merchant in the Lossandin [[Taishin\|Taishin]].
