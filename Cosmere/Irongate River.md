The **Irongate River** is the main river in the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]]. It starts at the eastern edge of the basin and then flows directly through [[Elendel\|Elendel]], splits around the [[Field of Rebirth\|Field of Rebirth]], and finally into the [[Hammondar Bay\|Hammondar Bay]].

## Geography
The main body of the river flows fairly straight westwards from its source in the east. It is unclear whether the source is in the [[Faleast Range\|Faleast Range]], the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]], or further outside the basin similar to at least two of the other major rivers/canals in the basin. Inside the city the river has been engineered to flow straight due east, and has been split such that it flows around the circular island forming the Field of Rebirth. After flowing under the three bridges close to the Northside Sixth Octant precinct it opens out under the outer ring-road bridge and flows into [[Hammondar Bay\|Hammondar Bay]]. The six major canals which channel the other six rivers in Elendel Basin are all also engineered to flow into the river around the Field of Rebirth, forming the other spokes which border the eight Octants of Elendel.
A rail line travels the length of the river along the southern bank, terminating at the inner ring-road of the Third Octant, with further connections through to most of the other rail lines. Outside the city the rail deviates from the river, providing a straighter route out to [[Steinel\|Steinel]]. Two spurs from the main line provide access to stations on the river at [[Dryport\|Dryport]] and across the river closer to Seinel. At Steinel the rail forks, one branch following the river more closely out to the eastern mountains, the other travelling south west to [[Elmsdel\|Elmsdel]] and [[Garmet\|Garmet]]. At least fifteen stations lie along the river, five of which in the city boundaries.
Lady [[Carmine Feltry\|Carmine Feltry]] is planning on opening a racetrack for motorcars on the old fairgrounds near the river.

## History
[[Wax\|Wax]] once visited [[Eastbridge\|Eastbridge]] which spans the river and provides a crossing point for both the outer ring-road and one of the rail stations. Wax was both impressed by the scale of the construction and humbled by the fact that it could be so easily obscured by the mists. While chasing [[Paalm\|Bleeder]], he caught up to her at Eastbridge and their final fight occured on the bridge, over the river.
Before leaving for [[New Seran\|New Seran]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]] caught a boat in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] and asked to reserve it for the whole day, starting with a trip to the Third Octant, which included traveling on the Irongate.
