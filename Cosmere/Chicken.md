**Chicken** is the name used by many [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] languages -- except the [[Shin\|Shin]] and the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] -- to refer to all species of birds. Only some are what would be called chickens in any other part of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. The term coming to mean all birds is a result of [[Vorin\|Vorin]] languages tending towards generalization, similar to how all alcohols became wines and all small creatures became [[Cremling\|cremlings]].
Chickens are not native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], but were brought to the planet during the initial human migration from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]]. They live mainly in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], with very few found further east and no undomesticated ones as far as [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. This being said, wild chickens can be found in the East - for instance, geese live in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] saw chickens during his visit to the [[Valley\|Valley]].

## Uses
Chickens are often edible, and are therefore an export of Shinovar. [[Vstim\|Vstim]] trades with [[Thresh\|Thresh]] and potentially other Shin for chickens which he sells to the other nations of Roshar, particularly in the east according to [[Rysn\|Rysn]]. Very expensive arrows may be fletched with chicken feathers. The elder [[Tanalan's father\|Tanalan]] wore decorative feathers on his battle helm, which Dalinar found odd. [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrows are fletched with geese feathers; geese live in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], which is why the Unkalaki language has a word for goose.
[[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] believes that eating chicken brings good luck and always eats some before his duels.

## Notable chickens
[[Jeksonofnone\|Jeksonofnone]], a bright green chicken brought by a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] merchant to the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] which could say its name upon command.
[[Mraize\|Mraize]] owns an [[Aviar\|Aviar]] which is referred to as a 'green chicken' by Shallan.
[[Lift\|Lift]] finds a 'red chicken' who belonged to an [[Gereh\|old Feruchemist]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] who Mraize murders early into the singer occupation of Urithiru. She is now raising the bird.
## Trivia
The use of the word 'chicken' to refer to all birds is known as a , or more specifically in this case, *pars pro toto*.
