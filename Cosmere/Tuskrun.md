**Tuskrun** is a predatory species on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]].
They are native to the isles of the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]], including [[Patji (island)\|Patji]]. Tuskrun are nearly the size of humans and hunt in packs, primarily during the day. They follow predictable movement patterns unless they are attracted by the blooming of one of Patji's Fingers. It is possible that they are omnivorous, as tuskrun make mounds while rooting around in the ground.
The trapper [[First of the Sky\|First of the Sky]] was killed by a tuskrun pack on Patji that had been attracted by [[Patji's Finger\|Patji's Fingers]].
