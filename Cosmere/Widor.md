**Widor** is the capital city of [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] on [[Sel\|Sel]], and by extension, the entire [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]].
It contains the [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn's]] palace, [[Zigareth\|Zigareth]]. A sword thought to be the mythical [[Gretgor\|Gretgor]] is enshrined somewhere in the city.

## Trivia
*Widor* could be the title of a future [[Elantris sequel\|Elantris sequel]], however, this is subject to change as Brandon has yet to canonize the name of this book. Because the city may be very prominent in the sequel, Brandon has considered changing the name from Widor.
Widor is not named on the map of Sycla in the 10th anniversary edition of *Elantris*, but it is presumably the city in northern Fjorden labeled as "Wyrn's Seat".
