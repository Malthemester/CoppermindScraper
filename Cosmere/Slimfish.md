## Ecology
Slimfish are a silvery color and swim in schools. They can jump out the water as a group when surprised, but if a large predator gets too close, they all become still. Slimfish are native to the seas around the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]], although they may be native to other bodies of water as well. The slimfish make too small a meal to interest a [[Deepwalker\|deepwalker]], but they still are spooked by its presence.
