## History
### Duladel Republic
The Duladel Republic was one of the major nations on Opelon during the time before the Reod. It was ruled by a group of citizens known as the Republican class. The members of the Republican class were elected by the Dula people. The aristocratic segment of the population was fond of garish clothing. The state religion of the Republic was [[Jesker\|Jesker]] which worshiped the [[Dor\|Dor]] as a sort of overspirit. Although a Duladel-specific magic system has not been introduced, it is possible that one exists.

### Occupation by the Fjordell Empire
About six months prior to the restoration of Elantris, the Duladel Republic collapsed. During a chaotic period a contingent of Derethi priests, led by the gyorn [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]], fomented a revolution. The Duladel Revolution was described as being even more violent than the Arelene Revolution following the Fall of Elantris; the Republican Class was killed in its entirety. A monarchy was then instituted and [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] replaced [[Jesker\|Jesker]] as the state religion. The collapse of Duladel prompted the engagement of Prince [[Raoden\|Raoden]] of Arelon to Princess [[Sarene\|Sarene]] of [[Teod\|Teod]]; their marriage would signify unity between the two remaining non-Derethi nations south of the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]].

## Language
Duladen was the language spoken by the Dula people. It reflected the "laid back, loose culture" of Duladel.
When [[Sarene\|Sarene]] discovers a group of practitioners of the [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jeskeri Mysteries]], she notes that many of them wear robes emblazoned with "Duladen runes".
