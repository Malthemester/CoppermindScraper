## Appearance
By the time he worked as the house steward in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], Gereh is white-bearded and frail. He wears multiple rings on his fingers, presumably serving as his metalminds. He occasionally fidgets nervously with these rings. He also alters his appearance slightly in an unknown way, making himself seem as if he had the epicanthic folds common in many humans on Roshar.

## Attributes & Abilities
Gereh was a Feruchemist with an unknown skillset; although if he was born post-Catacendre, it is likely he is a Ferring rather than a full Feruchemist. He could also effectively hide some of his physical features that made him stand out as a person of non-Rosharan descent. Gereh also had come into possession of a red Aviar. The powers granted by the Aviar are unknown, but the intelligent bird is very loyal to the man and able to feel Gereh's location from a distance.

## History
### Kholinar Steward
Nothing is known of Gereh's early life, or his planet of birth, but he worked long enough as steward in the Kholinar palace to be known as a fixture there, becoming a notable, if minor functionary. While Gereh's apparent profession was steward, he also served as an agent for an unknown master, watching over [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]]. It is likely that in the year 1167, Gereh became aware of [[Axindweth\|Axindweth]], a [[Terris\|Terriswoman]] agent working for [[Odium\|Odium]] in the Kholinar palace. He turned Gavilar against her and forced her to flee the planet.
Shortly thereafter, on the night of the treaty signing celebration with the [[Listeners\|listeners]], Gereh approached Queen [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] in the palace gardens prior to feast to inform her that Brightlord [[Rine Hatham\|Rine Hatham]] was expecting an audience with Gavilar to discuss border disputes and the king was nowhere to be found. He then led Navani to Hatham. Later that night, Navani found a grief-stricken Gereh and after she took his hand he informed her of Gavilar's assassination, although she did not immediately believe he was telling the truth. Gereh seemed deeply distraught by Gavilar's death, crying and shaking in sorrow.

### Retirement and Death
By 1175 Gereh seemed to have retired from active duty in the palace. He came to live in Urithiru with many of the other displaced Alethi and lived a quiet life where he was visited occasionally by [[Lift\|Lift]], who enjoyed looking in on the elderly. Just prior to the occupation of Urithiru by the [[Fused\|Fused]], Gereh's Aviar was away from Gereh for unknown reasons. He was attacked by Mraize in his rooms and was killed by a knife wound to the chest. He was either attacked while he was without his [[Metalmind\|metalminds]], or they were stripped from his body by Mraize after his death. The modifications that Gereh had made to the appearance of his eyes also vanished after his death. Gereh's Aviar had been waylaid by Mraize's Aviar, but it managed to return to Gereh's rooms with Lift's help to find the man's body and mourn over it. Mraize, who had been waiting, pursued Lift out of Gereh's rooms and caught her.
