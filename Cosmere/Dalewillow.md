**Dalewillow** is a species of tree on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Dalewillows have stone bark and long fronds like streamers, which twist when blown in the wind.
Brightness [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] thought that a tree she sketched in [[Shattered Plains\|Sebarial's warcamp]] was related to the dalewillow, as it has similar fronds. The [[Ghostblood\|Ghostblood]], [[Mraize\|Mraize]], left a note for Veil inside the tree.
