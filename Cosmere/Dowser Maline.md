**Dowser Maline** is a criminal in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
Dowser is uncouth; even in formal situations, he does not bother to shave or remove his bowler hat, and he tends to make blunt comments. He is devious and is tends to be suspicious of unfamiliar situations.

## History
He was a well-known criminal who had long been suspected of running an ore-smuggling operation into Elendel. His reputation earned him an invitation to [[Winsting Innate's auction\|Winsting Innate's auction]] alongside a number of other criminals and corrupt nobles, as the auction was a front for passing bribes to [[Winsting\|Winsting]]. Winsting also implied that his brother Governor [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate]] could be bought, which caught Dowser's attention. Dowser was accompanied by a tall, slender woman that Winsting did not recognize. She asked Winsting some pointed questions, and he suspected her of being a spy for the constabulary.
During the auction, gunfire suddenly erupted and all of the attendees including Dowser were killed. One of Winsting's guards thought that Dowser was the first to start shooting, but another guard blamed [[Darm (Mistborn)\|Darm]]. [[Wax\|Wax]] eventually deduced that [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] was a [[Kandra\|kandra]] who had used [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] [[Steel\|steel]] to quickly fire shots from multiple locations, causing the guests to turn on each other. She was presumably in disguise as Dowser's mysterious companion.
