The **drop-dead** is a species of tree native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Drop-dead trees are quite common in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] and are seen growing in the countryside by [[Lift\|Lift]]. Lift implies that there is an official name, but that most of the locals call it by this nickname. They are tall and twisty, with what looks like interwoven vines for trunks. The branches reach toward the sky more than growing to the sides.
The drop-deads survive the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] by having incredibly springy roots. During a highstorm the tree will fall flat to the ground. Afterward, it springs back up to its previous position. They grow in small patches, but far apart.
