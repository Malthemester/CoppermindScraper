## Appearance
Patji's Fingers are massive trees, with large drooping fronds. Each frond has a large blossom on the end, as long as two hands. After the flowers blossom, the tree produces fruit that falls to the ground.

## Ecology
The flowers of Patji's Fingers possess a unique trait. When they bloom, the flowers mimic the minds of an injured and fearful animal. This draws in predators that can sense minds, such as [[Tuskrun\|tuskrun]], hoping to find easy prey. The predators congregate around the tree and kill one another instead, fertilizing the ground beneath the tree with their corpses. These are usually easy to avoid, however if a trapper happens by a tree that has just bloomed he can be caught by surprise.
The trees also play another crucial role in the ecosystem. A large grove of a dozen of them cluster around [[Patji's Eye\|Patji's Eye]], where all juvenile [[Aviar\|Aviar]] visit. The birds eat the fruit that fall to the ground and in doing so consume a parasite in the fruit, which grant them their abilities. However, a human eating these fruits will not gain any abilities.

## History
The trapper [[First of the Sky\|First of the Sky]] happened upon one of Patji's Fingers that had just bloomed and was killed by a tuskrun pack.
When [[Vathi\|Vathi]] and [[Sixth of the Dusk (character)\|Sixth of the Dusk]] were hiding from the [[Nightmaw\|nightmaws]] in Patji's Eye, they tied one of the blossoms to a spear from Vathi's spear gun. They fired it away from them. The nightmaws were confused by the thoughts of the blossom and followed the spear, allowing Vathi and Dusk to escape.
