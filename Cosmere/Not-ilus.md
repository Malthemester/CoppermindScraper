The *Not-ilus* is a raft created by [[Spensa\|Spensa]] and [[Chet\|Chet]] while in the [[Belt\|belt]] of the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]]. They create the main body of the raft from two wooden doors they got from a building they find. They find several large nuts that are slightly bigger than a humanâ€™s head and similar to coconuts, and make cords from the stringy pulp, which they dry. They lash the doors together with the cords, and lash the hollowed-out nuts to the bottom of the raft. Because the nuts are watertight and filled with air, it allows the raft to float well.
[[M-Bot\|M-Bot]] is impressed with the raft, and compliments its structural integrity and remarkable buoyancy. While in the belt of the nowhere, Spensa and Chet use the *Not-ilus* to cross a fragment that is covered with water.
