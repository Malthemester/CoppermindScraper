The **Honorblades** are the magical swords carried by the [[Herald\|Heralds]] to fight the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] during the [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. They were pieces of Honor's soul that gave their wielders access to his essence.

There are ten Honorblades total, one for each Herald. Every Honorblade is unique, covered in various glyphs and patterns. They are technically a type of [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]; they were prototypes of the [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]] Shardblades, and share many qualities with them. Among others, they can be bonded, summoned and dismissed much like a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] can. Like living Shardblades, they can be used to operate [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]]. Though, unlike living Shardblades, they cannot change shape. It's unclear if they require ten heartbeats to be summoned, like dead Blades, or if they can appear instantly; this appears to be tied to their wielders' perception. They are near-indestructible, with the only thing known to be capable of damaging them being [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]]. Honorblades are made out of the [[God Metal\|God Metal]] of Honor.
Unlike Shardblades, however, Honorblades are not [[Spren\|spren]], and are not, nor have ever been, sapient. Rather, they are made of [[Honor\|Honor's]] own [[Investiture\|Investiture]], which he deliberately splintered off himself and crystallized into metallic form.
One does not need to be a Herald in order to use an Honorblade. Likewise, a Herald dying does not cause the Honorblade to be destroyed or vanish. However, the Honorblades do go with the Heralds when they travel to [[Braize\|Braize]], and they appear to have a crucial role in the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], as nine of the Heralds leave them behind in the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]].

### Surgebinding
Holding an Honorblade inherently grants the ability to [[Surgebind\|Surgebind]] without a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]]. This ability is similar to that of [[Metalmind\|unsealed metalminds]], though they rely on different magic systems.
Honorblade Surgebinding is in many ways inferior to Radiant Surgebinding; among others, the Surgebinding healing bestowed by Honorblades is less efficient than Radiant healing. Additionally, [[Surge\|Surges]] require more [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] as fuel to power them, up to dangerous levels. While the latter still applies to the Heralds, they were once powered directly by [[Honor\|Honor]], which made the issue of Stormlight consumption irrelevant.
If a Surgebinder uses an Honorblade that matches the power they already have, their powers will be slightly enhanced.

## History
 by Micah Epstein The [[Herald\|Heralds]] leaving their Blades behind at Aharietiam
### Heralds and Shinovar
>‚Äú*Our Blades must be left. The Oathpact ends now.*‚Äù
\-Jezrien[3]


It's unknown at what point the Heralds received their Honorblades, although it likely happened during the creation of the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. They used them throughout the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] until the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], whereupon nine of them left them at the site of the final battle before walking away from the Oathpact. [[Talenel\|Talenel's]] Honorblade disappeared along with him.
After the Heralds departed, one of the [[Shin\|Shin]] soldiers who participated in the battle stumbled upon them. Likely because of this, the nine Honorblades ended up in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. Over the millennia, they retained the Blades, and even occassinally used them, most notably during the Shin invasions. Even after the invasions failed, they would still train some of their people in the use of the Blades and the associated Surges.
At some point, the Herald [[Nale\|Nale]] reclaimed his own Blade from the Shin, leaving them with eight.

### War of Reckoning
A few years before the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] broke out, [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] family was given to the Honorblades. Szeth became the bearer of [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]]; his father [[Neturo-son-Vallano\|Neturo-son-Vallano]] became the bearer of [[Ishar\|Ishar's]]. Upon becoming the Truthless, Szeth kept his blade. The Blade would go on to cut a swath through the [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] leadership as Szeth became the infamous Assassin in White. Among others, [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]], [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]] of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and two [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasixes]] of [[Azir\|Azir]] fell to Jezrien's Honorblade.
At roughly the same time, the Herald Talenel returned from [[Braize\|Braize]], carrying his own Honorblade. He dropped it upon entering [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], but for unknown reasons, it didn't vanish. Talenel was later collected by one of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] soldiers, [[Bordin\|Bordin]], to be brought to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. The Blade was taken along with them; however, at some point during the transit, it was swapped out for a regular [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. It's unknown at this point who performed the swap and where the real Honorblade is currently located.
During the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Szeth used Jezrien's Honorblade to battle [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] above the Plains. At the end of the fight, Szeth unbonded it and it ended up in Kaladin's hands.

### The True Desolation
Kaladin later passed the Honorblade to Dalinar, who hid it in one of the vents in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. After a while, he gave it to [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]], to use for training and Oathgate operation in absence of their leader. The bridgemen would swap the Blade among themselves every once in a while in order to hide who currently had it and remain unpredictable.
Despite that, agents of the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] managed to figure out the time when [[Eth\|Eth]] held the Honorblade and attacked him. They snuck up to him with [[Teft\|Teft's]] sold-off uniform coat, then killed him with a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and stole the Honorblade before running off. [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] later gave the Blade to [[Odium\|Odium]] at the latter's demands. The Blade was later given to [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]], who passed it onto [[Moash\|Moash]] to allow him to join the [[Fused\|Fused]] in the skies.
At some point very recently, Ishar killed Neturo-son-Vallano and took back his Blade.

## Trivia
In *The Way of Kings Prime*, Honorblades allowed their wielders to locate other Honorblades. This has since been removed.
Surgebinders with Honorblades have been referred to as "unbound."
