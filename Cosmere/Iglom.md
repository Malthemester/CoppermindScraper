Dr. **Iglom** is a doctor in the [[DDF\|Defiant Defense Force]].
She is involved in studying [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] brainwaves. Though Dr. Iglom's colleague, Dr. [[Halbeth\|Halbeth]], believes that the increase in activity in the [[Writellum\|Writellum]] section of Spensa's brain when interacting with the [[Varvax\|Krell]] is proof of the defect, Dr. Iglom is less willing to draw conclusions off data from a single event. [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]] tasks [[Rikolfr\|Rikolfr]] with trying to encourage Dr. Iglom to strongly support the defects existence, particularly in relation to Spensa. In doing so, Ironsides would consider Dr. Iglom to have done her a personal favor.
