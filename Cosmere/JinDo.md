## Culture
As followers of [[Shu-Keseg\|Shu-Keseg]], the JinDo people follow the principle of unity through acceptance, preferring peace and openness above all. When the Fjordell Empire began to expand, the JinDo people decided to submit to Fjordell rule and outwardly convert to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] in order to avoid fighting.
The work of prestigious JinDo philosophers, mathematicians, and artists are well-known in other lands. [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], the official religion of the Fjordell Empire, has its origins in JinDo, as does the [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] religion prevalent in [[Teod\|Teod]] and [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. Like the [[Svordish\|Svordish]], the JinDo language has managed to survive Fjordell hegemony, perhaps due to the influence of JinDo culture throughout the empire.
There is a meditative martial art originating from JinDo called [[ChayShan\|ChayShan]], which can be used to help people focus their minds. This martial art is also the manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in the region. JinDo practitioners of ChayShan can use certain body movements to magically enhance themselves, though this effect appears to be temporary.
The JinDo people are also known for their use of eating utensils called [[MaiPon\|MaiPon sticks]], as well as their strict views on health. Obesity is frowned upon, although some JinDo foods are greasy, like [[HaiKo\|HaiKo]]. Spicy dishes are common in JinDo cuisine, and the nation is a major exporter of spices like [[RaiDel\|RaiDel peppers]].

## Notable JinDo People
[[Keseg\|Keseg]], also known as Keshu: Founder of the [[Shu-Keseg\|Shu-Keseg]] religion, from which [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] branched off.
[[Atsuko\|Atsuko]]: A JinDo artist who once visited the Rose Empire.
Baron [[Shuden\|Shuden]]: A JinDo merchant living in Arelon and one of [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] friends.
## Trivia
In the first published edition of *Elantris*, as well as in *The Emperor's Soul*, the term "Jindoeese" was used to describe things originating from the nation of Jindo. This was changed in the tenth anniversary edition of *Elantris* such that "JinDo" is now used as the nation's name, demonym, and adjectival form.
