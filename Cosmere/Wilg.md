>“*What, you think Wilg flies on clouds and dreams?*”
\-Allik expressing incredulity at Marasi’s comment[1]


*Wilg* is an outrigger of the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship *Brunstell*.

## Appearance and function
It is approximately six feet wide and twice as long. It has a seating compartment, similar to an automobile, with a glass windshield and sides open to the air. It is meant to seat six passengers. It can be [[Steel\|steel]] Pushed to gain flight. In order to stay in the air, passengers use Southern Scadrian medallions to reduce their bodyweight, like a [[Iron\|skimmer]]. It has fans that keep it in the air that are powered by an [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]] [[Ettmetal\|primer cube]]. Once in the air, wings with fans drop into place to provide forward thrust.

## History
It survived the crash of the *Brunstell* and was used by Allik and [[Wax\|Wax]]’s group to escape from the [[Set\|Set]] at the [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] crash site.
