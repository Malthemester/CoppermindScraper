## Appearance and Personality
Fjon is balding, pudgy, and stumpy. He wears the typical red robes of a Derethi priest. He is genial and is seen smiling and exchanging pleasantries with the residents of Kae. His office in the Derethi chapel is somewhat cluttered and decorated with paintings of nature scenes.
Although he is Fjordell, he defaults to speaking the [[Aonic\|Aonic]] language in Kae, until Hrathen admonishes him.

## History
### Head Arteth
Hrathen mentions that Fjon has lived in Arelon for ten years, approximately the same amount of time since the [[Reod\|Reod]] and the fall of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]]. Around five years after Fjon became head arteth, [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] arrived from [[Naen\|Naen]] with numerous Derethi converts, doubling the number of followers in Kae. Fjon is impressed by Dilaf and makes him an arteth, although this is not actually allowable under Derethi law.

### Banishment
When Hrathen arrives in Kae, he immediately dismisses Fjon back to [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] to be retrained in a monastery. Hrathen tells him that he has become complacent and too friendly with the Arelene locals, neglecting his duties as a Derethi priest. Hrathen believes Fjon has not used appropriate discipline with other priests under his command, and half of them will also need to be sent back to Fjorden. Dilaf agrees with Hrathen's assessment of Fjon's weakness.
Fjon is shocked and initially disappointed by his repatriation, but Hrathen shows him orders from [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]] stating that all of Arelon must be converted to Shu-Dereth within three months or the Fjordell Empire will invade. Fjon then capitulates and departs for Fjorden.
Hrathen has a second document from Wyrn that would have branded Fjon a traitor to Shu-Dereth (likely sentencing him to death), but he believes Fjon still has worth and chooses not to use it. However, he does instruct Dilaf to kill Fjon if he attempts to leave the ship bound for Fjorden.
Hrathen is not able to find a suitable replacement as head arteth after Fjon's departure. He realizes that the banishment of Fjon and the other less-disciplined priests left only the most zealous followers behind, and without a head arteth, Dilaf was able to step in as the de facto leader of the chapel.

### Return to Arelon
Fjon reappears during the [[Battle of Teoras\|Battle of Teoras]]. He stabs Hrathen in the chest in a surprise attack before smiling and disappearing into a crowd. Hrathen is confused to see Fjon and does not understand how he found him. It is revealed that Wyrn instructed Fjon to kill Hrathen in order to fulfill his penance to [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] and gain admission to the [[Rathbore Monastery\|Rathbore Monastery]] to train as an assassin. Wyrn used some form of magical foresight, possibly [[Fortune\|Fortune]], to inform Fjon of Hrathen's location. Fjon seems quite happy and content after stabbing Hrathen.

## Trivia
Brandon has some regret that Fjon's sudden reappearance was not adequately set up in *Elantris*, although he does feel that it represents the randomness that can occur in real life.
