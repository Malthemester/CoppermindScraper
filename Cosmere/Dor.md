## Appearance
The Dor often shows its presence through some sort of bright glowing, whether through Aons, the twists of the Dakhor bones, or in the wake of the movements of someone using ChayShan.

## Composition & Nature
The Dor is a mass of plasma-like substance in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], a large amount of power left behind after [[Odium\|Odium]] visited Sel. It is the remnant of the combined powers of Devotion and Dominion after the Shards were Splintered. The Dor exists in the Cognitive Realm and is very dangerous, appearing as a large source of mindless, uncontrolled power. Due to being in the Cognitive Realm it has attained rudimentary emotions.
The programming-esque way Investiture is drawn from the Dor is the result of the fact that its power is trapped in the Cognitive Realm, as well as the personalities of the original Vessels of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]] and the nature of Sel's [[Focus\|focus]]: forms. Those that use the Dor can sense when others are using it.
There is a [[God Metal\|God Metal]] that comes from the Dor.
With a proper conduit, such as certain active Aons, [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] could feed on the Dor. They would, however, likely consume the Investiture of the conduit before consuming a significant amount of the Dor, and, if given more stable access to the Dor, would still likely become saturated with Investiture before absorbing an appreciable amount of the Dor.

## Culture
In [[Jesker\|Jesker]], a religion practiced by many [[Duladel\|Dulas]], the Dor is the overspirit, an unseen energy that permeates the world. They believe that Dor is a force that controls the world. Those who follow the Jesker think that the Dor leads those who understand it towards harmony. It also keeps balance in the natural world. The followers of Jeskeri think that the Dor provides the motivation for all events in nature. It is responsible for everything from water "wanting" to flow downhill to teaching captive young birds how to fly. The Jeskeri Mysteries, a splinter group, look at the Dor in a slightly different way. Instead of a simple passive energy, they see the Dor as fate. The people who follow the Mysteries perform rituals to try to harness the Dor, instead of trying to become in harmony with it like regular followers of the Jesker. They try to invoke it to bring good or bad luck on other people. How the followers of the Jesker became aware of the Dor's presence is still unknown.
