**Rem** is a woman who lives in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She previously lived in Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] warcamp at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. She is killed by her husband [[Ned\|Ned]] outside of [[All's Alley\|All's Alley]].

## History
Rem followed her husband Ned to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], and then to Urithiru. Shortly following their arrival in Urithiru, Rem was strangled by a drunken Ned after she attempted to get him to leave All's Alley. During the attack, Ned scraped Rem's face with the ring that he was wearing. The next day, one of the barmaids at All's Alley was also killed in the exact same way. The hired thugs who protected the bar knew both Rem and Ned, and were unsurprised when Rem was killed. [[Betha\|Betha]], one of the thugs, had planned to leave any actions against Ned to [[Aladar\|Aladar's]] police force, however, after the death of the barmaid, the thugs took matters into their own hands and killed him.
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] learned of Rem's death from Betha while investigating murders that might be related to Sadeas's death. She later realized that the barmaid had been killed by the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], who had copied the initial murder of Rem.
