## Properties and Use
It is a pungent oil that is spread across the wounded area to prevent infection. It is known to scare away [[Rotspren\|rotspren]]. It is perhaps the most effective antiseptic known in Alethkar, and it is preferred to [[Larmic mucus\|larmic mucus]], [[Knobweed\|knobweed]] sap, and soap and water.

## History
Lister's oil was used in the hospitals in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. [[Vathe\|Vathe]], a surgeon who was educated at the [[Great Concourse of Kharbranth\|Great Concourse of Kharbranth]], knew of the effectiveness of lister's oil and trained his apprentice [[Lirin\|Lirin]] to use it. Lirin used it extensively in his surgery, including when he attended to [[Sani\|Sani's]] injury.
Lirin passed his knowledge of lister's oil on to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. Kaladin used it to treat wounds when it was available, and he often wished he had more of it. It was very expensive on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], costing two sapphire [[Spheres\|marks]] per bottle from an apothecary that Kaladin visited. Kaladin commented that even a bottle of cheaper larmic mucus would cost him ten days pay, and a bottle of lister's oil was around five times more expensive.
[[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] was treated with lister's oil in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] after cutting herself with a shard of broken glass.

## Trivia
The name likely refers to an out-of-universe historical figure named Joseph Lister. He was an early pioneer of antiseptics and introduced phenol to sterilize wounds and surgical implements.
