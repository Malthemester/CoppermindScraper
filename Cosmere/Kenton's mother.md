This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Kenton's mother** is a woman from the [[Darkside\|Darkside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
She marries a [[Dayside\|Daysider]], a powerful [[Sand mastery\|sand master]] named [[Praxton\|Praxton]], and gives birth to a number of children, including [[Kenton\|Kenton]]. The marriage between a sand master and a Darksider broke with tradition. The couple's children lacked natural talent for sand mastery, with only Kenton attempting to join the [[Diem\|Diem]]; it was rumored that this was due to the Darksider ethnicity polluting the family tree.
Kenton learned to speak [[Dynastic\|Dynastic]] from his mother, as it was her native tongue. After the attack on the [[Diem\|Diem]], Kenton notes that it has been two years since he has heard someone speak Dynastic, implying that his mother died or otherwise lost contact with him at that time.
