## Keep
House Lekal had a wonderful Keep in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. Their ballroom was shaped like a pyramid with five platforms, one large one for dancing and four smaller ones for eating. House Lekal's nobles bragged that whilst other houses had larger stained glass windows, they had the most detailed ones.

## Estate
House Lekal owns an estate in the south, but within the bounds of the [[New Empire\|New Empire]].
After the fall of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], [[Jastes Lekal\|Jastes Lekal]] crowned himself king of the estate. After his death, [[Audil Lekal\|Audil]] was crowned as second. Acting as 'Chief Ambassador of the [[New Empire\|New Empire']], [[Sazed\|Sazed]] and [[Breeze\|Breeze]] visited the estate, now called [[Lekal City\|Lekal City]], to force Audil's allegiance to [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]].
The estate and kingdom were destroyed by lava from an ashmount, most likely either Zerinah or Doriel.

## Politics
House Lekal is an enemy of [[House Venture\|House Venture]]. They are among the most economically stable Houses in Luthadel, though still weaker then Venture.

## Members
Members include [[Jastes\|Jastes]], a friend of [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]], and [[Audil Lekal\|Audil]].

## Post-Catacendre
After the Catacendre, the Lekals maintained their political power and were the primary rivals of [[Elendel\|Elendel]] Governor [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate]]. Due to this rivalry, House Lekal was one of the only Houses, along with [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]], known to be free of corrupt dealings with the Governor.
