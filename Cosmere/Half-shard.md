A **Half-shard** is a type of augmenter fabrial developed by [[Veden\|Veden]] [[Artifabrian\|Artifabrians]] late during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]].
They are the only known objects able to block a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] apart from [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], other Shardblades, metalminds and aluminium. Despite not granting any of the other benefits of Shardplate, such as enhanced strength and agility, they represent a significant breakthrough in fabrial science. Their bulky size and shape often leads to their users being hampered in ways Shardbearers are not. While inspired by Shardplate, half-shards work according to a different design principle.
Their design consists of a diamond-shaped metal plate with an infused gem attached to its back to increase its durability.
Half-shards were used by King [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]] of Jah Keved in his failed attempt to kill [[Szeth\|Szeth]].
When [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] travels to [[Azimir\|Azimir]], [[Navani\|Navani]] sends along detailed schematics of the new half-shards provided by [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] in an effort to generate good will with the Vizier's. 


## Design
Half-shards are diamond-shaped kite shields, large enough to cover a person's entire side. The back of the shield contains a steel box with a gemstone inside of it.
It is currently unknown which spren is used in the creation of Half-shards, but [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] says in his conversation with [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] that the spren entrapped in the Half-shard could have graced a Knights Radiant. However, he may have been lying or trying to mislead [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]].
