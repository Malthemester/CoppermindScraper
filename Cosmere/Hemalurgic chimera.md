## Appearance
Chimera's human forms are so twisted that they more resemble canines. They move on all fours "in a distinctly inhuman way". They have joints that bent the wrong way at the elbows and knees, and pure black eyes. They retain traces of human traits, such as "fingers that were too long" and hands with opposable thumbs.

## Hemalurgical Attributes
They were given a single Hemalurgic spike of an [[Trellium\|unknown metal]] charged with an unknown attribute. Exactly how they were created and what the single spike does is unclear. Due to their single spike, they are not susceptible to [[Harmony\|Harmony's]] control.

## Abilities
They run fast on all four limbs, and mainly attack by biting with sharp teeth or scratching with their nails. Their thickened skulls are resistant to modern firearms; Bleeder likely designed them that way to improve their ability to fight [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], though he eventually killed some of them with a close range shotgun blow.  Unlike kandra, they do not have the abilities to change forms.
