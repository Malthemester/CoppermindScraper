**Amark** is a [[Bavland\|Bavlander]] and a member of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is described as "sniffly" and speaks with a strong Bav accent. When he lives in Bavland, he wears the grimy clothing typical of mineworkers. He exhibits empathy, as he is upset by [[Took\|Took]] commanding [[Szeth\|Szeth]] to harm himself.

## History
Amark lived in the town of [[Ironsway\|Ironsway]] in Bavland and presumably worked as a miner alongside [[Ton (Veden)\|Ton]]. He and Ton drank together in a run-down tavern with other miners, listening to [[Took\|Took]] tell fictionalized stories about his life and showing off his [[Truthless\|Truthless]], Szeth. When Took ordered Szeth to cut himself, Amark protested, and became even more upset when Took told Szeth to slit his own throat.
During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], he became a bridgeman for [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] army on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] under unknown circumstances, and he was assigned to [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]]. Once [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] made the decision to save Bridge Four, he drastically reduced the casualties that they suffered on bridge runs, but they still lost Amark and [[Koolf\|Koolf]]. Kaladin later thought of Amark and other people that he was unable to save after [[Maps\|Maps]] was killed.
