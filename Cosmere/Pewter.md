**Pewter** is the internal physical pushing metal. An Allomancer burning pewter has increased physical strength, speed, durability, balance, and enhanced ability to heal. It allows the user to push their body far past what they would normally be able to achieve. Feruchemists can use pewter to store physical strength, and, when used as a Hemalurgic spike, pewter steals Physical Feruchemical powers.

## Alloy Composition
The pewter used in the Metallic Arts is an alloy of ninety-one percent tin and nine percent lead.

## Allomantic Use
A pewter [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Thug** or **Pewterarm**.
Pewter's utility is not simply from the increased strength or speed. It grants the user the ability to heal from otherwise deadly wounds, and to recover much quicker. [[Aluminum\|Aluminum]] in a wound will make it impossible for the Thug to heal the injury around the metal for as long as it remains in the body. Pewter also enhances the body's natural balance, granting almost unnaturally smooth movements. It also increases reaction speed and gives them resistance to hot and cold temperatures. Finally, it increases endurance, letting the body continue on long past when it would have normally shut down.
Pewter can be dangerous when it runs out, which is a serious concern since it is the fastest-burning of the eight basic metals. A Thug having just survived a deadly wound can die from the resulting effects when the body runs out of pewter to burn. However, the body will naturally burn pewter in an attempt to heal itself, so even an unconscious Thug can be given additional pewter to survive otherwise life-threatening situations.
Pewter roughly doubles the average personâ€™s strength, and triples it when flared.

### Pewter dragging
By constantly flaring pewter for a long time (pewter dragging), a Thug can achieve incredible things, such as running at roughly the speed of a galloping horse for extended periods. However, this is extremely dangerous and could even be lethal when the Thug stops burning pewter, even disregarding the fact that repeated pewter dragging will lead to [[Savantism\|savantism]], for there is a sudden burst of intense fatigue that had been suppressed by pewter. Several days of rest and sufficient food are required to replenish the Thug afterwards.

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of pewter needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, they would have enhanced physical abilities such as being able to heal more quickly, though not as fast as someone tapping health from a [[Gold\|goldmind]]. Thugs often die before becoming savants, as they feel neither pain nor exhaustion to any great extent and therefore may ignore wounds that later prove fatal.

## Feruchemical Use
A pewter [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Brute**. Pewter is used to store physical strength. However, as opposed to the simply enhanced body granted to an Allomancer burning pewter, a Brute tapping a pewtermind gains muscle mass and becomes physically larger. The additional muscles allow the Brute to have increased strength. For this reason, pewter metalminds are often designed to be able to stretch wider to accommodate the extra muscles. While storing physical strength, a Brute becomes scrawny and weak.
It's possible for a Brute to tap so much strength that their girth makes it difficult for them to maneuver properly.

### Compounding
A pewter [[Compounding\|Compounder]] would be able to use pewter to have a nearly infinite supply of physical strength.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, pewter steals Physical Feruchemical powers ([[Iron\|iron]], [[Steel\|steel]], [[Tin\|tin]], pewter, [[Cadmium\|cadmium]], [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]], [[Gold\|gold]], and [[Electrum\|electrum]]). All [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] were given a pewter spike charged with Feruchemical gold, allowing for their rapid healing.

### Kandra Blessing
The [[Kandra\|kandra]] can use a pair of these spikes as a [[Blessing\|Blessing]]. Like all kandra Blessings, the Blessing gives the [[Mistwraith\|mistwraiths]] sentience, with an unknown added benefit.

## Fabrial Use
A [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] with a pewter cage will express the element corresponding with the trapped spren, creating an augmentor fabrial. For example, a fabrial with a trapped flamespren will radiate heat. As with its use in Allomancy, this consumes [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] more quickly than other fabrials.
