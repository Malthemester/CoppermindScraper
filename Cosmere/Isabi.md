**Isabi** is a young scholar on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
Born the daughter of a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]], Isabi was apprenticed to [[Falilar\|Falilar]] and learned to be a scholar under his supervision. He worked with her to show her how to set up a scale so they could triangulate the [[Sibling\|Sibling's]] location by measuring the weight of the [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] they used to contact [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]]. She approached Navani one day with the blinking spanreed when the Sibling wanted to talk to her; while Navani was in contact with the spren, they rushed to different locations in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to take measurements.
After deliberately losing her half of the device, Navani waited to see if the Sibling would send another ruby. When [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]] showed up with a replacement, Navani asked Isabi to contact [[Kalami\|Kalami]] and ask her to attend an interrogation of the man. As she sent the message, however, Isabi received news of the explosion caused by [[Talnah\|Talnah]] and [[Nem\|Nem]] experimenting with [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] [[Black sphere\|black sphere]].
Isabi was with the group of scholars that accompanied Navani as she followed the Sibling's direction to a sapphire that, when infused, erected a barrier around the crystal pillar that [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] was trying to infuse with [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] to corrupt the spren.
