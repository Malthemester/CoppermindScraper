**Maod** is a member of the [[Ire\|Ire's]] guard.

## Attributes and Abilities
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] notes that the Ire's guardsmen have fair skin and speak the same strange tongue (presumably [[Aonic\|Aonic]]) as the [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] members of the Ire, implying that the guardsmen are also [[Sel\|Selish]]. Maod's presence outside of his own world qualifies him as a [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]], although he is presumably able to exist in the Ire's fortress due to a special connection from the building to the [[Dor\|Dor]].

## History
Maod was one of several guards assigned to watch duty on the roof of the Ire's fortress in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] when Kelsier approached during his search for a way to stop [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. Although Kelsier had learned how to make himself nearly invisible, Maod was still able to spot him sneaking up to the fortress wall. However, he lost sight of Kelsier in the darkness before Kelsier entered the building.
Maod believed that he might have seen a [[Shade\|shade]], a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] from [[Threnody\|Threnody]], although his captain was skeptical. The captain and Maod reported the sighting to [[Alonoe\|Alonoe]], who used a special device to check for Threnodites in the vicinity. Since Kelsier was from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], the device did not detect him, but the guards were told to remain on high alert.
