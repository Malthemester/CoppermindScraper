**Uli Da** was the original [[Vessel\|Vessel]] of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Ambition\|Ambition]]. She is referred to as female in the first Oathbringer letter sent to [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
She is a [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]], one of three races on [[Yolen\|Yolen]], and thus a non-human Vessel. She was present on Yolen at the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]].
After the Shattering, [[Rayse\|Rayse]] ([[Odium\|Odium]]) immediately felt threatened by Ambition, eventually finding her in the [[Threnodite system\|Threnodite system]] and clashing with her and [[Mercy\|Mercy]]. Although she fought back, she was mortally wounded, leaving "chunks" of her power behind; the struggle warped the entire solar system. Ambition was later [[Splinter\|Splintered]] by Odium in another location under unknown circumstances. Uli Da's death and the Splintering of Ambition have had effects across the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
The author of the first *Oathbringer* letter, presumed to be [[Edgli\|Edgli]] ([[Endowment\|Endowment]]), expresses contempt for Uli Da and is happy that she was killed.
