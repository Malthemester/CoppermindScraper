In Mistborn: Secret History, [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] goes to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], and describes everything that doesn't have [[Investiture\|Investiture]] to be made of 'thick, shifting mists' that coalesced in the same shape as everything in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. This is likely where the Expanse of the Vapors gets its name. As part of the Scadrian subastral, mist obscures everything and metals glow with a brilliant light. The counterpart to bodies of water is smoky stone where mysterious plants grow and the counterpart to solid earth is a misty, vaporous substance.
