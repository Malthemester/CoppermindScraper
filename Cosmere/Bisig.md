## Appearance and Personality
Bisig is thin with an angular face and doesn't speak much. Despite being quite reserved, he is close to becoming betrothed.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]], Bisig has [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities, including healing powers and flight through the use of [[Basic Lashing\|Basic Lashings]]. He has at least a basic knowledge of [[Towers\|Towers]], and thinks [[Rlain\|Rlain]] is good at the game due to his skill at bluffing.

## History
Bisig was a member of Bridge Four under [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]]; it is not known why he was assigned to bridge duty. He was the last member of Bridge Four to join in with the reforms that Kaladin brought, and likely only conformed because of [[Rock\|Rock's]] and [[Teft\|Teft's]] threats, not out of loyalty. After the crew gave Rock a razor as a gift, he was one of the two men to get hugged by the [[Horneater\|Horneater]].
Bisig was one of the guards during the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] prior to the balcony collapsing on Elhokar, but was dismissed prior to the actual attack. When he got back to the barracks, he joined in with the others to discuss how they missed carrying their bridge. He and most of the rest of Bridge Four were among the expedition to find [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]]. Bisig survived the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], although he lost the use of his right hand to a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] wound during [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] attack on [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]].
His upcoming marriage was one of several situations that [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] brought up to Kaladin in order to get him to think about how he would accommodate the men as they branched out in different directions from being simple slaves. Bisig became a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] squire to Kaladin along with the rest of Bridge Four, which granted him access to [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and the ability to heal his hand injury. He crashed into the ceiling during practice one time while trying to imitate [[Lopen\|Lopen]], prompting [[Skar\|Skar]] to feel jealous of his ability to draw in Stormlight at all.
When [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] sent an assassin to recover [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] from Bridge Four, Bisig was badly wounded in the conflict, suffering another Shardblade injury, this time to his arm. He survived, however, and came to long enough to describe how the perpetrator had been wearing Teft's lieutenant's coat.
Bisig presumably joined in the offensive in [[Emul\|Emul]] with most of the other Windrunners, and wasn‚Äôt present during the occupation of Urithiru.

## Trivia
Bisig is a cameo for a friend or family member of Brandon's. A possible inspiration is a couple named Geoff and Rachel Biesinger who are mentioned in the acknowledgements of *The Way of Kings*.
