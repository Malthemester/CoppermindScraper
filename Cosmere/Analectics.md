The **Analectics** is a book written by [[Corvana\|Corvana]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
In the Analectics, Corvana compiled the some of chants sung by the [[Vanrial\|Vanrial]], an order of artists. The Vanrial have sung these words year after year without understanding the words, whose meaning had been lost to time. The Vanrial claimed that these songs were written in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]] by the Heralds.
Princess [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] owned a copy of the Analectics, which she left on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in the care of her uncle. In 1173, when Brightlady [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] recorded the fourteenth vision that Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] had, she recognized that his last words as part of the Analectics. She referred to Jasnah's copy and confirmed that it was identical to a quote from the Vanrial's songs. In doing so, she proved that Dalinar's visions were not fabrications, but rather drawn from somewhere else. This discovery also allowed for the possibility of translating the songs recorded in the Analectics, as well as the Dawnchant.
