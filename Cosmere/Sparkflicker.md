A **sparkflicker** (sometimes **spark-flicker**) is a [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]] fire striker that can also be worn as an ornament.
It is similar in use to flint-and-steel, albeit it lacks the flint. Rather, a Herdazian wearing a sparkflicker uses their own nails (which are crystalline, owing to their [[Singer\|singer]] ancestry) to start the fire. In addition, it is sometimes used as an ornament or a decorative article of clothing. It has no martial application.
In the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] warcamps, a Herdazian is seen using a sparkflicker and oil to make bursts of flames in the air. The [[Dieno\|Mink]] carries a sparkflicker with him to the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] conflict in [[Emul\|Emul]] and is seen absently creating sparks while he speaks with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] following a battle. Some [[Alethi\|Alethi]] believe that all Herdazians wear sparkflickers, though [[Havarah\|Havarah]], an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] with Herdazian ancestry and fingernails, doesn't carry one.
