>“*“Such a curious memory. That life feels like a dream now. I remember pain. Confusion. A stern figure bringing me more pain--though I now recognize you were seeking to heal me. So much trouble to go through for a slave child.”*”
\-Abiajan

**Abiajan** is a [[Singer\|singer]] from [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. Before the beginning of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], she was a [[Parshwoman\|parshwoman]] slave of [[Wistiow\|Wistiow]]. She fled Hearthstone when the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] arrived, but was later sent back by the [[Fused\|Fused]] after they conquered [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] to serve as its citylady.

## Appearance and Personality
Abiajan has white skin with red marbling on her cheeks. She wears a [[Havah\|havah]] in the Alethi style, with a sleeve covering her [[Safehand\|safehand]]. Her clothing has more muted colors in order to feature her unique skin patterns.
Abiajan is resentful toward humans for enslaving her people. When she recounts a memory of [[Lirin\|Lirin]] healing her many years ago, she suggests his actions were motivated by her monetary value as a slave. She speaks and acts with Alethi mannerisms. Like other parshmen, however, she tries to imitate the singers of old, as described by the Fused, in an effort to reclaim the culture of her ancestors. She also seems to have a sense of duty and leadership, as she was appointed the citylady of Hearthstone and has some influence over the people there.

## History
>“*Did you feel for me, the poor confused slave child whose mind had been stolen from her? Did you weep for us, surgeon, and the life we led?*”
\-Abiajan to Lirin[1]


As a parshwoman, Abiajan was a slave to Brightlord Wistiow from a very young age, though she did not have this name back then. At some point during her childhood, her arm was injured, and Lirin set her arm and healed her.
When the Everstorm came and restored the parshmen from [[Slaveform\|slaveform]], Abiajan fled Hearthstone with the rest of the singers. Several months later, she returned at the orders of the Fused, who had appointed her as the citylady. Many other singers from the surrounding area also came to the town with her, but only Abiajan was originally from Hearthstone itself.
As [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]] refugees arrived in Hearthstone to escape the fighting with [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces, Abiajan allowed Lirin to inspect each person for disease, as she seemed to be quite concerned that plaguespren would find their way into the city. One day, a Fused called [[Lezian\|Lezian]] unexpectedly arrived in Hearthstone, causing Abiajan to drop her regal attitude and grow flustered. Without her knowledge, Lirin had arranged for [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to extract a Herdazian general known as the [[Dieno\|Mink]] and take him to join the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Lezian revealed that he was searching for Kaladin, who had been spotted earlier and was soon discovered hiding among the refugees. A fight broke out, resulting in Lezian's escape and one singer soldier's death. At Kaladin's suggestion, Abiajan persuaded the rest of the singers that they had lost the fight and guided them all to a nearby [[Stormshelter\|stormshelter]] outside of town.
