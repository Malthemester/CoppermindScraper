This page or section contains details from the unpublished work *Dragonsteel Prime*!This information has the potential to ruin plot elements of both published works and upcoming book releases for the reader. It should also be considered uncanonical and could completely change in the future.

**Dragonsteel Prime** was [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson's]] seventh novel and was written as part of his Masters Thesis when working towards a Master's Degree in Creative Writing. Five copies are currently held in the Harold B Lee Library at Brigham Young University, four of which are available for circulation. After positive response to his release of *The Way of Kings Prime*, Brandon has discussed a possible release of this draft as part of a "Sanderson Curiosities" series.
Brandon has stated that it was not his best work. He plans to rewrite and publish the series after the completion of [[The Stormlight Archive\|The Stormlight Archive]]. Sections of the book, including locations such as the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], were later re-purposed in [[The Way of Kings\|The Way of Kings]], but Brandon considers some of the other events to be canon. He had some trepidation over removing the Shattered Plains because, though it was not as essential to the story, he felt it was the part of the book that worked best.
In 2007, Brandon began work on a rewrite of the Dragonsteel series. He began with [[The Liar of Partinel\|The Liar of Partinel]] and [[The Lightweaver of Rens\|The Lightweaver of Rens]], which take place approximately five hundred years before the events of Dragonsteel Prime, which he then planned to rewrite and release as 'The Eternal War'. However, after finishing Liar he was unsatisfied with the result and shelved the series for a future date. Since 'The Eternal War' would begin the main story arc, at the time he also intended to call that book 'Dragonsteel Book 1' and expect the readers to connect it to the previous two books to avoid the confusion of starting his story arc with Book 3. The story takes place on [[Yolen\|Yolen]] and focuses on [[Jerick\|Jerick]], but also includes other viewpoint characters such as Topaz, also known as [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
