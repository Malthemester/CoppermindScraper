The **Reshi Sea** is a body of water in northern [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is the largest known sea on Roshar and it covers a significant portion of the middle of the continent. The southern end of the sea is separated from the [[Purelake\|Purelake]] by [[Marabethia\|Marabethia]], while the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]] archipelago lies at the northern end of the sea, adjacent to the [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]]. Other countries along the sea's coastline include [[Iri\|Iri]], [[Rira (country)\|Rira]], [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]], [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], and [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]]. During the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], the sea was in the territory of [[Rishir\|Rishir]].
In addition to the various islands in the Reshi Sea, it is also home to massive inhabited [[Greatshell\|greatshells]] known as [[Tai-na\|Tai-na]]. Although the sea is deeper than the Purelake, it is shallow enough to allow the Tai-na to walk along the seafloor. An unknown species of minnow also lives in the sea.
The area has a hot and humid tropical climate, and it does not snow. The waters of the sea are usually quite calm, although the region is presumably in the path of [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. The seawater is quite warm most of the time.

## Inhabitants
For more information, see [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]].
Many of the islands in the Reshi Sea are known to be inhabited by the native people, known as the Reshi. Various Tai-na contain self-contained kingdoms that also attract foreigners seeking a simple life. The [[Ardent\|ardents]] [[Ashir\|Ashir]] and [[Geranid\|Geranid]] live on a small island where they can focus on scientific experiments. The [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]] coastline is known to be inhabited, and it is [[Toh\|Toh's]] last known location.
