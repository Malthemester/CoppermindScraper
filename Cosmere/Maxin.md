**Maxin** is a thief and member of Huqin's crew who attempts to rob the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] in [[Azir\|Azir]].

## Appearance and Personality
Like the rest of [[Huqin\|Huqin's]] crew (except [[Lift\|Lift]]), he is Azish and has dark hair and skin. He is optimistic that the crew will be able to pull of their planned heist.

## History
During the attempted heist of the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] in 1173, Maxin and [[Tigzikk\|Tigzikk]] were assigned to infiltrate the gardens in disguise as scribes to mingle with the bureaucrats gathered there during the choosing of the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]]. They were acting as lookouts; if anything seemed amiss, they would use whistles to warn the rest of the crew that was robbing the Palace. It is not clear if Maxin and Tigzikk escaped the palace with Huqin after [[Nale\|Nale's]] intervention.
