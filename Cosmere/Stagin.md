**Stagin** is a man from the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] that owns a still and brews whiskey.
Whiskey from Stagin's still was a favorite of [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] when he was a lawman in the Roughs. Wax used it in his vials of [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] [[Steel\|steel]] shavings in lieu of water or some other liquid. When Wax returned to [[Elendel\|Elendel]] to take his place as leader of [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]] after his [[Edwarn Ladrian\|uncle's]] "death", he bemoaned the fact that his supply of Stagin's whiskey would soon run out.
