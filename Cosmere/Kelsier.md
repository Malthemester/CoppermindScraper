>‚Äú*There's always another secret.*‚Äù
\-Kelsier's mantra


**Kelsier** is a half-[[Skaa\|skaa]] [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is stern and intense, but always smiling; another act of rebellion against the Lord Ruler's oppression. He hates injustice and takes this hatred to the extreme, which originally resulted in him being unable to see good in any of the nobility. This was changed by [[Vin\|Vin]] who fell in love with [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]]. Kelsier went on to save Elend's life from an [[Inquisitor\|inquisitor]]. His late wife [[Mare\|Mare]] collected pre-Ascension memorabilia, and he keeps one piece, a drawing of a [[Flower picture\|flower]], to inspire his crew. Kelsier is the younger brother of [[Marsh\|Marsh]], who is disappointed at Kelsier's apparent lack of direction or purpose until Kelsier leads the [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebellion]]. He always keeps a smile on his face, because that is the one thing the Lord Ruler can't take from him.

\-Preservation to Kelsier[8]


Kelsier is tall and hawk-faced and has light-blonde hair and hazel eyes; he has a multitude of scars crossing both arms from his time in the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]]. He usually wears a nobleman's suit (a colored vest with dark trousers and a coat), and during the night he wears his [[Mistcloak\|mistcloak]].
He is almost always late to gatherings, which he attributes to always having somewhere better to be. He always smiles and projects an excited and positive attitude, which is particularly unusual in the skaa underground. He does this in order to fight the Lord Ruler's oppression of all the skaa, wanting to have one thing which cannot be taken away from him. He hates all of the nobility and tends to believe that all of them are to blame for the plight of the skaa, although near the end of his life this attitude changes due to Vin's insistence that [[Elend\|Elend]] is different and that not all the nobles should be fought. He has an imposing presence and is a natural leader, easily taking charge and swaying even the downtrodden skaa of Luthadel into joining the rebellion with his charming personality. If Kelsier orders a person around, it is a sign of affection.
Kelsier is a psychopath, or at least has some psychopathic tendencies. He shows little empathy or fear, as well as a high ego, and is frequently quick to resort to using violence‚Äîoften lethal violence‚Äîto solve problems, even when doing so clearly won't actually help the people he is supposedly trying to help. He is arrogant and very driven which, combined with his power, makes him incredibly dangerous; he is willing to go extremely far to achieve his goals, though is not quite as utilitarian as [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]]. Perhaps as a result of his egotism and arrogance, several of his plans involve setting himself up as a powerful, mysterious, or even divine figure. He is a great agent of chaos and is very good at tearing things down and messing with what other people want. There is a darkness to him that other heroes, such as [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], would fight but that Kelsier instead embraces and is so ruthless that, in a fight with other notable people from the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], he would be the most likely to win; even [[Hoid\|Hoid]] considers him incredibly dangerous. Had his life gone differently, he could have been an outright evil person and, outside the context of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], would likely be a villain.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Allomancy
Kelsier is a Mistborn, so he can burn every Allomantic metal, although he is particularly proficient with the external physical metals [[Iron\|iron]] and [[Steel\|steel]]. He is capable of using them with a high degree of precision to control the momentum and rotation of dozens of pieces of metal simultaneously. He once used them in his fight with a [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitor]], so the metals acted like they were alive, twitching and flying through the air to cut and distract the Steel Inquisitor. He lacks finesse in the external mental abilities of [[Zinc\|zinc]] and [[Brass\|brass]] as he tends to create large changes in emotional states as opposed to the more subtle Soothing abilities of [[Breeze\|Breeze]], although he can affect a relatively large mass of people. He is quite proficient at pewter dragging and has enough practice to maintain it for hours and still maintain a fair amount of clarity afterwards.

### Hemalurgy
Kelsier has a spike of either iron or steel in in his left eye socket, allowing him to see lines of metal in addition to normal sight, although he likely has limited depth perception.

### Sliver
After Kelsier died, he became a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] through the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], making him able to resist the pull of the [[Beyond\|Beyond]]. After Holding and releasing the Shard of [[Preservation\|Preservation]], Kelsier became a [[Sliver\|Sliver]].

### Preservation
Kelsier held Preservation for a short time but was bad at using it because he was a Cognitive Shadow at the time and did not match well with Preservation's Intent.

## History
### Early Life
 by  Rafael Sousa  Kelsier meeting the skaa
Born to a [[Noble\|noble]] father and skaa mother, his mother kept both Kelsier and Marsh alive by pretending that she was noble to their father so that their children would be considered merely illegitimate noblemen instead of half-breeds; however, their father eventually found out. Thus Kelsier's mother was killed, and because of this, the brothers have a deep hatred of noblemen. Kelsier then made his living as a thief, becoming famous throughout [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]].
He teamed up with the escaped Plantation skaa [[Dockson\|Dockson]] and the [[Tineye\|Tineye]] [[Mare\|Mare]], whom he married. They were extremely successful. Kelsier later said that "he had more Money than he could Spend" however, after a failed attempt at stealing from the Lord Ruler in his secret room inside [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]], he was sent to the [[Atium\|atium]] mines in the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]]. There he spent his time believing that his wife Mare had betrayed him to the Lord Ruler until he witnessed his wife being beaten to death by guards after she gifted her Atium bead to him. He then "Snapped", becoming a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]]. Using Allomancy he was able to escape the Pits. Kelsier was then trained by a Mistborn named [[Gemmel\|Gemmel]] and they traveled to the far north of the [[Western Dominance\|Western Dominance]] to a city called [[Mantiz\|Mantiz]] where Kelsier fought and killed the Mistborn [[Antillius Shezler\|Antillius Shezler]]. From the skaa in [[Keep Shezler\|Keep Shezler]] he heard rumors of the [[Malatium\|Eleventh metal]]. Kelsier sought and eventually found the Eleventh metal as he believed it would help him to defeat the Lord Ruler.

### Recruiting his Crew
>‚Äú*Ah, but being an annoyance is something that I am very good at. In fact, I‚Äôm far more than just a mild annoyance. People tell me I can be downright frustrating! Might as well use that talent for the cause of good eh?*‚Äù
\-Kelsier to Marsh[34]


After discovering the [[Malatium\|Eleventh Metal]] Kelsier started to prepare his Plan by hiring the [[Kandra\|Kandra]] [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]]. Then he killed the Noble Lord [[Renoux\|Renoux]] and let [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]] impersonate him. He met with [[Yeden\|Yeden]] the leader of the skaa rebellion and made Yeden hire him to bring down the Final Empire. On Kelsier's way back to Luthadel, he made a stop at the farm of Lord [[Themos Tresting\|Themos Tresting]] to talk with the farm skaa. When Lord Tresting attempted to rape a skaa girl Kelsier saved her, killing Tresting and all his servants and soldiers in the process. He burned down the Manor and purposely departed in a way that forced the skaa to join the Rebellion. When he arrived in Luthadel he first Reunited with his old partner and best Friend [[Dockson\|Dockson]].
Dockson told Kelsier about a young Allomancer girl [[Marsh\|Marsh]] discoverd a few Weeks ago. Marsh suspected that the Girl (Vin) was a Mistborn. Kelsier and Dockson went to the ministry to see her first hand. They watched Vin soothe an obligator during [[Camon\|Camon's]] scheme confirming that she was at least a [[Soother\|Soother]]. After Camon and Vin left Kelsier realized that the ministry had already discovered that Camon was a thief and only played along to find the crew's hideout. A Steel Inquisitor had been present, discovering Vin's Allomancy. The Inquisitor and some soliders followed Camon to find his hideout to wipe out his crew, but Kelsier lured the Inquisitor away by using his own Allomancy while Dockson took out the soldiers. They went to the hideout themselves just in time to save Vin from Camon. Kelsier knocked out Camon with Steelpushes and gave control over the crew to [Milev]]. He forced the rest of the crew to leave, only leaving Vin. Kelsier's suspicions that Vin was a Mistborn were confirmed when he saw that she was able to burn zinc. Kelsier offered her to join his crew. Vin didn't trust him but agreed in order to learn how to use Allomancy. Later, Kelsier invited a team of the best (and Kelsier believed, the kindest) thieves in the city to a gathering in Camon's safe house. He introduced them and Vin to Yeden and explained his plan to destroy the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] and kill the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. [[Breeze\|Breeze]], [[Ham\|Ham]], [[Clubs\|Clubs]], and Clubs' nephew [[Spook\|Spook]] joined his Crew. While Initially Hostile in the end Kelsier's Brother Marsh joined and together the Crew developed a Plan to defeat the Final Empire.
The Plan was to Secretly build up an Army of 20000 trained skaa soldiers in the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]] while at the same time causing confusion and distrust in the nobility to cause a House War. Once their Army was trained and the House's grew unstable enough, they would send a part of their Army to attack the Pits of Hathsin, forcing the Garrison of Luthadel to go and defend the Pits. With the Garrison gone and the noblity weakened by the War the Rest of the Army then could take over Luthadel. The Yeden would gain control of the city and the crew would receive the Lord Rulers [[Atium\|atium]] stash as payment.
Breeze would recruit men for the rebellion, Ham would train them in the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]], Dockson would direct the operation's finances, Clubs would hide the group's Allomancy with copperclouds, OreSeur in the roll of Lord Renoux would buy the necessary equipment, Marsh would infiltrate the Steel ministry posing as an obligator, Kelsier would use his Mistborne Power to make attacks on the nobility to create tension between the houses, and Vin would gather information in the noble court posing as Renoux's niece Valette.
Kelsier also wanted to try kill the Lord Ruler with the Eleventh Metal as a "voluntary bonus".

 by  Kelly Mai  Kelsier overlooking [[Yeden\|Yeden's]] rebel army
### The Skaa Rebellion
To put the plan in Motion Kelsier first targeted [[Keep Venture\|Keep Venture]] as House Venture was the currently most Powerful House in Luthadel and an attack on it would have the greatest impact. Kelsier killed 8 [[Hazekiller\|Hazekillers]], stole a bag of [[Atium\|atium]] and made sure that it became Known that a Mistborn had attacked a greate House, something forbidden by an unspoken agreement between the houses. He gifted Vin a [[Mistcloak\|Mistcloak]] and Started to teach her Allomancy. Vin expected that Kelsier would use his knowledge to control her, but to her Surprise he openly explained her the Eight Basic Metals. Kelsier let Vin jump over the City walls as an exercise for [[Steel\|steel]] and [[Iron\|iron]] and was Surprised how Voluntarily she did it; remembering his own training. Outside the City they saw a [[Mistwraith\|Mistwraith]]. Back at the City Gates Kelsier Introduce Vin to [[Sazed\|Sazed]]. Realizing Vin didn't trust him he told her that in his Crew they trust each other. He offered her to teach her about [[Gold\|gold]] and [[Atium\|atium]] give her the Money he took from Camon and allowing her to leave as he didn't want to force somebody in his Crew. Vin decided to stay in order to see if he telled the truth about trusting others.
In the following months Kelsier himself takes on many roles for the plan, acting as a beacon to the repressed skaa, assisting in recruitment, attacking many noblemen to increase the tensions between the Great Houses,, collecting information by purchasing it from informants, and even poses as an informant himself in order to provide misinformation to noblemen. He continued training Vin and was Surprised by her quick progress. Though they suffer many setbacks, Kelsier's leadership allows the rebellion to attain an army of sufficient size to hold Luthadel.

### Death
>‚Äú*But you can't kill me, Lord Tyrant. I represent that one thing you've never been able to kill, no matter how hard you try. I am hope.*‚Äù
\-Kelsier to the Lord Ruler, last words before death[2]

When several skaa from the rebellion were about to be executed, Kelsier attempts to save them. He is confronted by a Steel Inquisitor, which he eventually manages to defeat by beheading him with the Inquisitor's own obsidian axe. However, Kelsier is then confronted by the Lord Ruler, who backhands him across the face and then stabs him in the chest with a spear, killing him. Kelsier later reveals in his letter to Vin that he had intended to use the Eleventh Metal to destroy the Lord Ruler but could not discover how to use it in his fight. After his death, [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]] takes his bones and appears before several groups of skaa, making them believe that Kelsier survived somehow. This results in the skaa considering him a god, leading to the founding of the Church of the Survivor, which refers to Kelsier as "Lord of the Mists". Vin also became a major religious figure in the wake of his death, as the Survivorists consider her Kelsier's heir. [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] learned the location of his bones from OreSeur, and used them to convince the people of Luthadel to hide in the caverns after King [[Ferson Penrod\|Penrod]] was corrupted by Ruin.

### Time in the Cognitive Realm
 by  LittleGreyDragon  Kelsier meeting [[Hoid\|Hoid]]
Immediately after his death, Kelsier arrived in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] and met [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. He then asked Preservation if they are God, and after being told yes he promptly punched Preservation in the face. Then he found the power at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] and became trapped there with [[Ruin\|Ruin]], though merging with the power of the Well allowed him to become a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] and resist the pull of the [[Beyond\|Beyond]]. While he was in the Well, Hoid passed by and Kelsier essentially challenges him to a fight that Kelsier ultimately loses. He feels Ruin's presence during his time in the Well.
Once he is freed from the Well along with Ruin, he initially travels around through the Cognitive version of Luthadel, seeking out his friends. He finds Vin and Ham near the steps of Keep Venture and also learned that Dockson had died in the Battle of Luthadel. He walks past Luthadel towards the lake of the same name, near which he finds [[Khrissalla\|Khriss]] and [[Nazrilof\|Nazh]]. They question him on Preservation's appearance after learning he has spoken directly with the Shard, and then continue their discussion onto other topics. Khriss mentions the [[Ire\|Ire]] which sets Kelsier onto his next quest of finding their base of operation.
During his journey to find the Ire, he runs into Ruin and has a discussion about Ruin's intent. After that, he left the area of the Cognitive Realm surrounding Scadrial and moved closer to finding the Ire. When he reaches their base, he moved past their guards and passed the wall into their chambers. He ultimately only took a glass orb from them after thwarting their plan to take over become the Vessel of Preservation after [[Leras\|Leras']] death.
When he returned to Scadrial he found that Preservation's power was significantly weakened. He also ran into Vin and was shocked to see how far she had come in the time he was away. He stayed with her for a while after that but ultimately had to leave.

>‚Äú*From the Well of Ascension, of course. It's the same power, after all. Solid in the metal you fed to Elend. The liquid in the pool you burned. And vapor in the air, confined to night. Hiding you. Protecting you.Giving you power!*‚Äù
\-Kelsier speaks to Vin before she Ascends.[47][19]

When Leras died and Ruin began to [[Splinter\|Splinter]] the Shard of Preservation, Kelsier used the [[Ire's orb\|Ire's orb]] to Connect with Preservation and Ascend, allowing him to protect the power and hold it until Vin could take it. Despite Preservation not usually being able to speak into the minds of other, due to some combination of [[Spook\|Spook]] being near death, having a broken soul, and believing Kelsier was a god, he was able to talk to Spook. He used this opportunity to tell Spook to send a message to Vin, warning her that any spiked person could potentially be under Ruin's control. Secretly, however, he knew that Ruin would send Marsh to intercept the message, and was hoping that reading the message would give Marsh the information he needed to remove [[Vin's earring\|Vin's earring]], which was also a Hemalurgic spike that was keeping her from taking up Preservation's power. When Marsh caught Vin in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], he attacked Ruin with Preservation's power, weakening Ruin's control over Marsh just enough for Marsh to rip out Vin's earring. With the spike removed, Kelsier encouraged her to take up the power, relinquishing it so that she can do so. After she and Elend are killed, Kelsier spoke with them before they moved on to the Beyond.
After Sazed's Ascension and Spook's rise to political power, Kelsier began to speak with Spook about finding a way to bring himself back to the Physical Realm. As a Cognitive Shadow tied to Scadrial, it is difficult for him to travel to other planets via Shadesmar. He does not yet know the secret to overcome this limitation. His bones survived the Ascension of [[Harmony\|Harmony]], and may have helped him regain physical form.

### Continued Worship Post-Catacendre
Many years after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], the cult which started after Kelsier's deception with [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]] directly following his death has become a fully-formed religion. The [[Church of the Survivor\|Church of the Survivor]], or Survivorism, is possibly the most organized of Scadrial's religions in this period, as well as being the clear favorite among the social elite and downtrodden alike.
[[Steris\|Steris]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] are both members of this religion, though Marasi admits that it is more because she was raised in it. Its central tenet is simply to survive, by any means, until you cannot survive any longer. Priests in this religion wear robes with stitching up the arms to emulate Kelsier's scars from the Pits of Hathsin.
The "Survivor's Statemark" is one of the symbols of the faith. When [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] killed [[Father Bin\|Father Bin]] by nailing him to a wall, it is described as a parody of the Survivor's Statemark, implying that the Statemark depicts the way Kelsier died, impaled by a spear.
Aside from the Survivorists, there was also a whole civilization of people that worshiped Kelsier far to to the south of Elendel, calling him the **Sovereign**. Kelsier had traveled there several years after the Catacendre, inhabiting a physical body that was spiked in the right eye, and found the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] slowly dying of an unexplained coldness. He helped the people there survive using his knowledge of the Metallic Arts, showing them how to make unsealed metalminds to store attributes like heat in a way that could be shared with anyone. As the Sovereign, Kelsier ruled the Southern Scadrians for a time and formed another religion that deified [[Metalborn\|Metalborn]], and then he left.
Before leaving them, he created the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]], a collection of unsealed metalminds forged together and containing all kinds of attributes in extremely large quantities. He hid the artifact away somewhere in the north and then disappeared.

 by  cola-san  Kelsier, as the Sovereign
### Kelsier and Wax
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] was a direct descendant of a close associate of Kelsier, [[Edgard Ladrian\|Edgard Ladrian]]. As a [[Pathian\|Pathian]], Wax did not worship Kelsier, but his life has nonetheless been drastically affected by the Survivor.
[[Ironeyes\|Ironeyes]] decided to give Wax a book explaining Hemalurgy because he believed Wax was doing Kelsier's work. This book proved vital in solving the case of [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]]. While conversing with Harmony regarding the case, Harmony said that Wax's casual way of talking to him reminded him of Kelsier. Harmony also made vague allusions to the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] that Kelsier once ruled as the Sovereign.
Later on, a group of Southern Scadrians traveled north in search of the Sovereign's Bands of Mourning, but were captured by the [[Set\|Set]], who decided to seek the Bands as well. Wax and his friends became embroiled in this incident in opposition to the Set, and Wax was almost killed in an encounter with them. After [[Marasi\|Marasi]] solved the riddle of the Bands and wielded it to escape the Set, she gave it to Wax, who wielded it and became incredibly powerful. Wax then used the artifact to defeat the Set and save the Southern Scadrian prisoners, using up a lot of the Investiture stored in the Bands.
Soon afterwards, Wax accessed a [[Coppermind\|coppermind]] contained in a coin-like Southern Scadrian medallion that Hoid had given him and saw a vision of what appeared to be Kelsier's memory of discovering the Southern Scadrians hundreds of years prior. The vision, seen from Kelsier's point of view, showed that his spiked right eye viewed the world through Allomantic lines, similar to [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]], while his left eye saw things normally.


### Cosmere-wide Activity
Kelsier is known as Thaidakar to the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]], a secret society that operates on several planets, including [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Kelsier is the presumed leader of the organization, which [[Mraize\|Mraize]] calls "the most powerful organization in all the cosmere." He is referred to by [[Hoid\|Hoid]] as "the Lord of Scars." Kelsier is [[Iyatil\|Iyatil's]] master. While he is incapable of leaving Scadrial in person, he uses an "avatar" to visit the Ghostbloods on Roshar. He appears to be using the Ghostbloods to find a way for him to leave Scadrial and is very interested in learning from the [[Heralds\|Heralds]], particularly [[Kalak\|Kalak]], as they are subject to a similar restriction. When assassinated by [[Szeth\|Szeth]], [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] suspects Thaidakar of ordering his death. He has also worked together with Khriss.

## Titles
Kelsier is known by many titles, the origins of which vary.

**Survivor of Hathsin** - A title given to him by the skaa, as he was the only person ever to escape the Pits alive. Later used as a religious title.
**Survivor of Mists,[67] Survivor of Death,[42] Survivor, Lord of the Mists** - Different titles used by members of the [[Church of the Survivor\|Church of the Survivor]] in reference to him.
**He Who Lived**, A title used by Jak
**Sovereign** - Used by the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] without knowledge as to his actual identity. Originally assumed by [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] to be the Lord Ruler.
**Lord of Scars,[3][4] Thaidakar[3][5]** - Used by the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]].

## Relationships
 by  eyeronis  With Marsh
### Marsh
>‚Äú*No, Kelsier was not fond of Marsh. But strangely, he still loved him.*‚Äù
\-Kelsier[69]


[[Marsh\|Marsh]] is Kelsier‚Äôs older brother. The two of them have a strained relationship. Marsh resents Kelsier because Kelsier had success with the skaa rebellion soon after Marsh quit being its leader. Marsh doesn‚Äôt like a lot of Kelsier‚Äôs actions and the way he handles the rebellion. He strongly disapproves of the way Kelsier flippantly kills noblemen and those who serve them without a second thought.
Despite his disapproval of Kelsier‚Äôs actions, Marsh is still willing to infiltrate the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]] as part of Kelsier‚Äôs plan. Despite their strained relationship, Kelsier is still grieved and angry when they find evidence of Marsh‚Äôs death.
Marsh is aware of Kelsier‚Äôs current activities as a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]].
