**Luesh** is a steward of [[House Davar\|House Davar]] in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is a member of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]].

## Appearance and Personality
He has a wrinkled, leathery face with well-worn frown lines. He is able to gain the trust of the Davar children despite secretly deceiving them.

## History
Luesh joined the Davar household circa ? 1172, and he quickly became a confidant of [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]]. Although he denied it, Luesh was presumably the person who gave Lin an illicit [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] [[Fabrial\|fabrial]]. Luesh was trained to use the Soulcaster, and he and Lin worked with a surveyor to create artificial marble deposits on Davar land, significantly improving the family's previously dire financial situation. Lin was able to leverage the restored name of House Davar to gain political influence in the [[Valam princedom\|Valam princedom]], likely positioning himself to become [[Highprince\|highprince]].
After Lin's death, the Davar children found the Soulcaster, which had been broken in a scuffle. The family tried to have the fabrial repaired, but Luesh could not make it function. Desperate for money, [[Shallan\|Shallan]] soon devised a plan to steal [[Jasnah's Soulcaster\|Jasnah Kholin's Soulcaster]]. After she set out on her journey, [[Balat\|Balat]] and [[Eylita\|Eylita]] informed her that Luesh died in his sleep, and that a pendant with a distinctive symbol was found on his body. Furthermore, a group of individuals visited the Davar estate‚Äîone of whom had a tattoo of the same symbol on his hand‚Äîprofessing knowledge of the Soulcaster and demanding that it be returned, intensifying the need for Shallan to steal Jasnah's fabrial. Balat concluded that Luesh was a plant all along, and that he acted as a liaison between Lin and his mysterious backers.
Shallan learned that [[Kabsal\|Kabsal]] had the same symbol tattooed on his arm, implying that he and Luesh belonged to the same organization; Jasnah believed it to be named the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]]. Shallan worried that her father was also a member. She later confirmed the existence of the Ghostbloods after meeting [[Mraize\|Mraize]].
