**Artifabrians** are engineers that design and construct [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. In [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nations it is considered a women's profession.
They discover groupings of fabrials, which they name Altering fabrials, Pairing fabrials, and Warning fabrials. Altering and Pairing fabrials are areas of great interest to artifabrians and are the subject of much research and theorizing. Aside from their research, artifabrians also take on the duty of installing new fabrials.
During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] several major breakthroughs have been accomplished by artifabrians, such as the [[Veden\|Veden]] [[Half-shard\|Half-shards]]. Artifabrians have spent centuries trying to recreate [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], and half-shards are the closest they have come although they operate under a different design scheme.
The methods they use to craft fabrials, including capturing [[Spren\|spren]] in gems, are closely guarded secrets of the artifabrian community. [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] artifabrians have a secretive means to precisely adjust the Stormlight within a fabrial.
