## Appearance and Personality
 by  Sheep 
Palona is described as having dark eyes and the rocklike crystalline fingernails of a Herdazian. She is short, middle-aged, and has dark, curly hair. She speaks with a Herdazian accent and presumably has the typical deep tan skin of her people.
She is kind, although she is sometimes blunt. [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] notes several instances when Palona helpfully anticipates her needs, and Palona often pays personal visits to her quarters.
Palona enjoys luxury, spending money, and wearing fashionable clothing, yet she is not pretentious. She sometimes appears to be detached from events occurring around her, as she is seen relaxing with a novel during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and reading gossip reports amidst the squabbling of Rosharan royalty. Her contemporaries, including Shallan and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]], tend to make light of her penchant for massages.
Although she is not married to Turinad, she runs the household and appears to be familiar with the traditions of Alethi nobility. However, she does not have the modesty of a typical [[Vorin\|Vorin]] woman, as she does not cover her back while being massaged, even when other people are present. She covers her [[Safehand\|safehand]], but is sometimes careless about showing it.

## History
 by  Elisgardor  Palona and [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]]
Little is known of Palona's history before meeting Sebarial. She obliquely referred to herself as a "stray" that Turinad brought home. Recent years had seen significant migration of Herdazian people to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and the Sebarial warcamp likely had the largest Herdazian population on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], but neither of those facts were explicitly linked to Palona's presence, and her birthplace was unknown. The duration of Palona and Sebarial's relationship was unclear, but it seemed to be well-established by the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]; other nobles were never surprised by Palona's presence, nor did they comment on the nature of her arrangement with Sebarial.
Palona claimed that Turinad wanted to marry her, while Turinad said that he paid more than three [[Broam\|broams]] a week for Palona; it is not clear if either of these statements were meant literally, as the two of them tended to playfully antagonize one another.

### Shattered Plains
 by  Marie Seeberger  During the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]
Palona was first seen living in the Sebarial warcamp on the Shattered Plains. The Sebarial warcamp was well-constructed and more similar to a city than other warcamps, and Palona lived in a manor with Turinad. Their home's interior was particularly opulent, with marble, silk, crystal, and gold among the materials used in the decor. The residence also had numerous servants, running water, and gardens with ornamental [[Shalebark\|shalebark]].
When Sebarial brought Shallan to the manor, Palona was very welcoming. She ensured that Shallan received a stipend that Turinad promised, her own room and servants, housing for her entourage, and the use of a horse-drawn carriage for transportation. She also helped Shallan improve the Herdazian accent that she occasionally used while disguised. Palona reviewed reports from Shallan regarding both House Sebarial's finances and updates on local events.
As the mistress of a Highprince, Palona attended many events for the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] elite. She was present when [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]] fought an ill-advised duel against multiple Shardbearers. She insisted on coming to the Shattered Plains when Sebarial agreed to join [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] assault on the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. Palona wore fashionable clothing while she and Sebarial lounged and ate [[Sellafruit\|sellafruit]], even as the fighting escalated. Dalinar was surprised to learn that Sebarial actually helped during the battle, indicating that the couple may have been paying more attention than it seemed.

### Urithiru
Palona was among the many residents of the Shattered Plains who moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after the activation of the [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. Sebarial's actions at the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] gained Dalinar's trust and he was named [[Highprince of Commerce\|Highprince of Commerce]], giving House Sebarial additional influence in the displaced Alethi government. Palona was among the first people to see the corpse of [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] after his murder in the halls of Urithiru, and flippantly called his death a "problem solved", as she was one of the many people who hated Sadeas. She was present at Dalinar and Navani's small wedding ceremony, as well as Dalinar's meetings when he attempted to form a multinational coalition as part of his plan to unite Roshar. She was one of the first people to know that [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] had been crowned as Queen.
Shallan continued to live with Sebarial and Palona in their section of Urithiru, and she saw Palona as something of a mother figure who often checked in on her. Palona appeared in [[Shallan's sketchbook\|Shallan's sketchbook]], and her face sometimes appeared in Shallan's Lightweaving illusions. Palona took an interest in Shallan's interaction with [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], and thought that the other [[Unmade\|Unmade]] should be sought out to ensure that they were imprisoned.
