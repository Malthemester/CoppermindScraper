### Epic Weakness
Sourcefield's weakness is Kool-Aid. While contact with Kool-Aid will dampen her powers, she needs to swallow Kool-Aid to fully disable her powers. In her past, her grandparents tried to kill her by poisoning her Kool-aid drink.

## History
When she was a young child her grandparents poisoned her Kool-Aid trying to attempt a cult ritual. Emiline was able to crawl out to the street and get help from someone passing by. This connection to her weakness was one of the pieces of information that led David to a new understanding of Epic powers and weaknesses.
