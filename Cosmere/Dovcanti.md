**Dovcanti** is a poet from [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who lived approximately 1,500 years before the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], or about three hundred years prior to the start of the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] calendar.
Dovcanti wrote an epic about the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]], describing clashes between humans and [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] after [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]]. The epic was considered pseudohistorical by the Vorin church because the [[Ardent\|ardentia]] did not believe any Voidbringers survived Aharietiam. However, recent revelations about the [[Herald\|Heralds']] abandonment of the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] and the restoration of the [[Singer\|singers]] by the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] lend more credence to Dovcanti's work.
