The **Nightwatcher** is a powerful [[Spren\|spren]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is a [[Splinter\|Splinter]] of [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] and grants boons and curses to mortals through the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]]. She is one of the three potential [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren.
The Nightwatcher would bless those who sought her out with one blessing of her choosing. In exchange for this blessing, she also bestows a single curse, although this curse very rarely has any obvious relation to the blessing that was gained. Because of the Nightwatcher's ethereal nature and ties to a single location, the [[Valley\|Valley]], she is considered by many to be a powerful [[Spren\|spren]]. It is surprisingly common for devoutly Vorin [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] go to the Nightwatcher at one point or another over the course of their lives.
She does not always appear to those seeking her, having a tendency to avoid groups and likely [[Worldhopping\|foreigners]] like [[Felt\|Felt]]. Supposedly, the best time of day to visit the Nightwatcher is right after the sun sets.

## Appearance and Personality
 by  Dejan Delic 
For more images, see [[Nightwatcher/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
The Nightwatcher manifests in the Physical Realm as dark green and vaguely person shaped. Described as crawling on the ground with too-long arms reaching out and pulling her along as she floats above the ground. She appears to leave a trail of her essence behind her, like a river of twisting vapor curling through the trees. The only part of her that has any detail is her smooth distinctly feminine face with silken black eyes. She seems to be able to create extra limbs like smaller hands to interact with people. Cultivation made the Nightwatcher in such a way that she is not shaped by people's perception or belief of her, unlike most spren. This is why she behaves less human.

## Origin
Called "child" by [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], it is likely that the Nightwatcher was created by [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] for a specific purpose from a different spren much like the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] was by [[Honor\|Honor]]. The Nightwatcher is implied to be one of three [[Spren\|spren]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that are [[Cognitive Shadow\|shadows of a god]].
The Nightwatcher was deliberately created by Cultivation to be un-Connected to humans and is unaffected by the way they think about her. This was done so she could grow more organically.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Nahel Bond
For more information, see Order of Bondsmiths.
The Nightwatcher is one of the three great [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren. Forming a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with her grants one the power over the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Tension\|Tension]] and [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]]. While a Bondsmith can use Adhesion the way a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] would, they can also apply their powers in different manner, using them more in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]]. Using Spiritual Adhesion, a Bondsmith can form a [[Connection\|Connection]] between themselves and another person, allowing them to speak their language. They also seem capable of hearing the spiritual aspects of objects and using this to mend broken things back whole. Each Bondsmith seems to make use of a different variety of Light to fuel their abilities, the Stormfather's Bondsmith uses Stormlight, the Sibling's [[Towerlight\|Towerlight]], and presumably the Nightwatcher grants her Bondsmith [[Lifelight\|Lifelight]].

 by  EccoS  Meeting a petitioner
The Nightwatcher claims to have the ability to grant almost any physical request one might ask of her, though just because she can does not mean she will give what is asked for. She claims to be able to give many things such as renown, wealth, skill, the ability to swing a sword and never tire, beauty, followers, and glory, as well as physical possessions such as spheres, gemstones, Shardblades and Plate, or even a unique and highly Invested item like [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]]. The Nightwatcher does have trouble with extremely nebulous requests relating to human emotion. The Nightwatcher is also capable of changing a person's species. She can also change a person's eye color, and has done so in the past.
Anyone is allowed to seek a single boon from the Nightwatcher. To do this, the supplicant must first travel to the [[Valley\|Valley]] in the west, where the Nightwatcher resides. After finding the Nightwatcher, the supplicant may request a boon. There are no clear restrictions on what the Nightwatcher has the power to grant--like most things regarding the Old Magic, the few known facts are surrounded by a web of myths and legends. The precise phrasing of the request does not appear to make a difference, however, since the Nightwatcher bestows a boon that she feels the supplicant deserves. In most cases, the continued pain of the curse appears to outweigh the blessing of the boon, even if the supplicant receives the boon they desired. A notable exception was [[Av\|Av's]] father, who received enough cloth to keep his family from starving during a famine. His curse, seeing the world upside down, apparently stopped troubling him after he acclimated to the situation.


Contrary to popular belief, it is not possible to avoid the curse by carefully phrasing a request--or even to predict the curse that the Nightwatcher will bestow. Interestingly, it does not appear that balance is carefully maintained through an individual blessing and curse--often, highly visible curses are the result of relatively minor boons. The curses can be quite thorough, however--in one case, a man lost all feeling in both of his hands until the day he died. Whether these curses follow some cosmic justice, or are merely the result of a capricious spren, is unknown.
The curse, as well as the boon, is permanent. Through history many visitors have tried to get rid of their curse, but there are no known cases of success.
