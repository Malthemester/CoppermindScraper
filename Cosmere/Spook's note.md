This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Spook’s note** contains a message to [[Vin\|Vin]], warning her about [[Ruin\|Ruin]]’s ability to manipulate people whose body is [[Hemalurgy\|pierced by metal]]. While holding the power of [[Preservation\|Preservation]], [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] managed to speak to [[Spook\|Spook]] after he was wounded in the [[Coup of Urteau\|Coup of Urteau]] and encouraged him to send the message, which Kelsier hoped would get Vin to remove [[Vin's earring\|her earring]].
Spook inscribed it on a thin metal sheet, since only text carved in metal couldn’t be altered and read by Ruin. Because Spook was seriously injured during the [[Coup of Urteau\|Coup of Urteau]], he was unable to deliver the note personally, but Captain [[Goradel\|Goradel]] offered to do so since Vin had saved his life on the night of the [[Collapse\|Collapse]].
Goradel set out from Urteau in the direction of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], where Vin was heading. The note, however, never got to Vin, as Ruin sent [[Marsh\|Marsh]] to intercept him. Marsh killed Goradel after a short fight, then took the message, which Ruin forced him to read aloud so that he coud learn what it said.
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], however, had expected Ruin to do this, and actually intended for Marsh to receive the message. When Marsh captured Vin in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], Kelsier used Preservation's power to attack Ruin, distracting the Shard just enough for Marsh to reassert control over himself and pull out Vin's earring, which allowed her to finally Ascend as Preservation.

>“*Vin, My mind is clouded. A part of me wonders what is real anymore. Yet, one thing seems to press on me again and again. I must tell you something. I don't know if it will matter, but I must say it nonetheless.*
\-The thing we fight is real. I have seen it. It tried to destroy me,and it tried to destroy the people of Urteau. It got control of me through a method I wasn't expecting. Metal. A little sliver of metal piercing my body. With that, it was able to twist my thoughts. It couldn't take complete control of me, like you control the koloss, but it did something similar, I think. Perhaps the piece of metal wasn't big enough. I don't know.
Either way, it appeared to me, taking the form of Kelsier. It did the same thing to the king here in Urteau. It is clever. It is subtle.
Be careful, Vin. Don't trust anyone pierced by metal! Even the smallest bit can taint a man.
Spook.
