>“*Yelig-nar, called Blightwind, was one that could speak like a man, though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed.*”
\-A quote from Traxil's work[1]


**Traxil** is a scholar on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] known to have written about the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] and [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]]. [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] doubted the authenticity of the source material. [[Hessi\|Hessi]] disagreed with Jasnah's opinions, and endorsed the quote from Traxil.

>“*The Unmade were obviously fabrications of folklore. Curiously, most were not considered individuals, but instead personifications of kinds of destruction. This quote is from Traxil, line 33, considered a primary source, though I doubt its authenticity.*”
\-Jasnah's critique of the above quote.[1]


>“*Traxil mentions Yelig-nar, named Blightwind, in an oft-cited quote. Though Jasnah Kholin has famously called its accuracy into question, I believe it.*”
\-Hessi discusses the above critique in Mythica.[2]
