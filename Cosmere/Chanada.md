**Chanada** is the head ardent of the Alethi warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
After [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] was rediscovered, Chanada traveled there via the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] along with the rest of the people from the warcamps. After she heard that [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] were courting, she had [[Kadash\|Kadash]] go to all the other ardents, such as [[Rushu\|Rushu]] and [[Ladent\|Ladent]] to order them not to perform a marriage ceremony between the two. As a result, Dalinar and Navani could not find an ardent to marry them, so the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] had to officiate instead.
