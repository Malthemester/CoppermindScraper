## Appearance and Personality
The Stump is an elderly woman who is very stern. Many of the children in the orphanage don't like her and neither do most of the surrounding urchins. Despite this, Arshqqam looks fondly upon the children noting they gave her the nickname of the "The Stump" and calling it a "glorious title, to come from children". She does, however, also like her original name.

>‚Äú*Her skin drooped off her bones like something you'd might hack up after catching the crud in the slums, and she had spindly fingers that Lift figured might be twigs she'd glued in place after her real ones fell off*‚Äù
\-Lift on Arshqqam[4]

Arshqqam has spindly fingers and and her skin droops. She also appears fragile. [[Lift\|Lift]] describes her as a shrivelled up weed of a woman. Further, she says that the woman looks like the child of a broom and a particularly determined clump of moss. In turn, once joining the Knight's Radiant, the Stump confesses she is fond of Lift though feels Lift needs a firm hand.
Arshqqam did not want to leave her life in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] behind but felt compelled to join the Knight's Radiant once her powers manifested. She does not understand why she in particular was chosen given her advanced age but if Lift, a child, was doing joining the cause, she felt there was no excuse for her not to do so.
[[Shallan\|Veil]] looks favourably on the Stump, commenting that there is more to the Stump than the surface level would suggest. She notes Arshqqam's careful yet understated attention to her appearance and the ease with which she is able to discuss strategy with [[Adolin\|Adolin]], a powerful man, without being intimidated.

## History
### Running Tashi's Light Orphanage
The Stump ran the orphanage and seemed to have done so for some time. She wasn't well liked by those on the outside; according to Lift, they said she was mean and only gave away food because she wanted to look good for the officials who watch the place, yet it was possible that she founded the orphanage. She was known to run a money laundering scheme that involved exchanging donations to the orphanage with dun [[Spheres\|spheres]]. She had been unconsciously using her spheres' [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to heal sick urchins in her care, who she then mistakenly accused of only pretending to be sick. After learning of her true nature, the charges against her were dismissed by [[Gawx\|the Prime Aqasix]] on behalf of [[Lift\|Lift]].
When [[Nale\|Nale]] instructed his [[Skybreaker\|Skybreakers]] to hunt down a Radiant in Yeddaw, they mistakenly thought it was [[Arclo\|Arclo]]. In truth, Nale was after the Stump. After a brief altercation involving Lift, the Herald stabbed the Stump but did not kill her immediately, in order to lure Lift out, who then healed her after Nale abandoned his hunt for Radiants.
Some colleagues of [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] convinced the Stump to visit [[Azimir\|Azimir]], probably to speak with [[Ethid\|Ethid]], and she let them make sketches of her spren.

### Expedition to Lasting Integrity
Due to the honorspren's high-regard for Truthwatchers, The Stump was chosen by Adolin and [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to join the expedition to Lasting Integrity. She disagreed with Adolin's initial plan of trying to convince the honorspren by guilt or threat. Instead, she backed taking a more emotional and passionate approach suggested by her spren, [[Dreaming-though-Awake\|Dreaming-though-Awake]] and advised Adolin that any approach would need to appeal to the honorspren's sense of honor.
Upon Adolin's capture she, along with [[Zu (Roshar)\|Zu]] and other soldiers on the expedition, left to report to [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] about the trial in Lasting Integrity.
