## History
>“* There are ... times when one must accept the aid of darkness in order to contain a greater darkness.*”
\- Gaotona[4]


He was brought into the [[Rose Palace\|Rose Palace]] by [[Gaotona\|Gaotona]] in order to craft wards with his [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]] abilities to imprison [[Shai\|Shai]] in a small room. He requested Shai's bones as his only payment. Every morning he would visit her cell to renew his mark on the door. Sometimes he arrived late, which Shai noticed and exploited to escape.
He had a lover in Dzhamar who wrote him letters. The arrival of those letters woke him up in the morning, which is why he would come on time to stamp Shai. When he didn't get news from home, he drank, which caused him to arrive later to renew the spell.
When Shai escaped from the Palace, he attempted to capture her with his skeletals. All of his skeletals were destroyed in the confrontation, and he and was wounded by Shai. Before she left, Shai told him that his lover wants him back home and doesn't care about how much money he's making working at the capital, which is why she worded her letters the way that she did.
