**Tobias** is one of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds']] [[Aspect\|aspects]].
He is a lanky, dark-skinned old man with white hair who is an expert on history and trivia. He tends to ramble on about things and has been coined a walking Wikipedia. Stephen seems to find his voice quite comforting.
His insanity is that he hallucinates about an astronaut named Stan in space who lives on a satellite, who occasionally sends him weather information. Stan is not one of Stephen's hallucinations, but is Tobias'. Stephen also mentions that Tobias has schizophrenia.
Tobias dies from a stab wound inflicted by a nightmare version of [[Armando\|Armando]]. This has a strange effect on Stephen, causing him to forget things like the Eiffel Tower.
