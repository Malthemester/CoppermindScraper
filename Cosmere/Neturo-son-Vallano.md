## Attributes and Abilities

The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] also believes that Ishar's current [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] status is directly related to his possession of the Blade, implying that Neturo may have had access to the more esoteric, Bondsmith-specific uses of those Surges.

## History
Neturo-son-Vallano worked as a shepherd on the coast of Shinovar during Szeth's youth. There were white cliffs near their home. Later, his family was given to the Honorblades, and Neturo was forced to learn how to kill. At some point, he became the bearer of Ishar's Honorblade, although it is unknown if this was the first of the Blades he bore.
When Szeth became [[Truthless\|Truthless]], he stopped thinking of himself as "Szeth-son-Neturo" in order to not mar his father's name, even going so far as to stop thinking about Neturo entirely.
Neturo kept Ishar's secrets, but planned to withhold his Blade from him, should Ishar come asking after it. However, Ishar claims that Neturo willingly gave up his Blade and welcomed Ishar for the chance to die. While the details are unclear, Neturo did in fact lose possession of the Honorblade and is now dead.
When Szeth found out about his father's death at the hands of Ishar, he was shaken deeply. Upon recovering, he drew [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] for the first time in a year to strike at Ishar.
