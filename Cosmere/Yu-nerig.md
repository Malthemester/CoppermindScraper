## Appearance and Anatomy
Like all greatshell species, yu-nerig contain [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] - smaller than those of larger species like [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]], but still of respectable size. The chrysalises they make when they pupate are similar in shape and texture to those of chasmfiends.

## Ecology
Yu-nerig normally live in the sea depths, and only come onto land to pupate. They also form symbiotic bonds with spren, like most creatures on Roshar. This is one of the factors that allow them, like all greatshells, to grow to such large sizes.

## Lore
Marabethian criminal code allows the prisoners condemned to capital punishment to be used as a bait for the yu-nerig in order to be pardoned. The criminals are dangled over a seaside cliff when the water is at high tide with a cut sliced in each of their cheeks, and told their crimes will be pardoned if they hang there for a week and are not eaten by the yu-nerig. They are usually attacked within the first day, however most prisoners still opt to take the chance. The Marabethian saying of "you have eyes of red and blue" is a reference to this, as they say the prisoners can see only two things: red for the blood dripping from their wounds and blue for the sea.
