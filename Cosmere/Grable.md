## Appearance and Personality
Grable shows off his wealth by wearing bright colors, and his influence by the number of bodyguards that accompany him. However, his appearance is marred by a long, greasy beard and missing teeth. He is cautious, conniving, and greedy.

## History
Grable was approached by Denth and [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] because he was a strong supporter of [[Vahr\|Vahr]]’s rebellion, and Denth hoped that he would continue to feed unrest in the city of T'Telir by attacking caravans of food. It took weeks to set up a meeting with him in one of his restaurants, and Denth paid him for his time alone.

>“*It’s a pity we couldn’t do business. I hope you’ll think of me for future dealings.*”
\-Grable, after Denth kills some of his bodyguards[1]

Grable did not believe that Vivenna was actually the princess of [[Idris\|Idris]], instead assuming that she simply had enough royal blood to [[Royal Locks\|change her hair color]]. However, he made it clear that even if she was an impostor she would still have value in pulling off various schemes in the city. It quickly became clear that Grable was more interested in having Vivenna for his own purposes than helping their cause.
When Denth refused to "sell" Vivenna, Grable's bodyguards moved to attack him, but he instantly killed them. The attack was an attempt at taking Vivenna by force instead of paying for her, or alternatively testing Denth’s reputation as a swordsman and mercenary. According to [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]], the meeting was beneficial for Grable either way: “He either got to verify Denth’s skill or he got you (Vivenna).”
Grable reacted nonchalantly to the swordplay. He instead mentioned that he had been suspicious of Denth since his sudden appearance a decade earlier, and he shrewdly pointed out Denth's mysterious past and his reputation of being "inhumanly" fast. Grable did not have his other bodyguards attempt an attack, and Denth decided to leave with Vivenna and Tonk Fah. Grable presumably did not fear Denth since he was confident that Denth could not kill him without facing the retaliation of half the criminals in T'Telir. After leaving the meeting, Denth was cautious to avoid being followed by Grable's spies, even though he believed Grable did not care about the bodyguards he killed.

## Trivia
Grable makes a comment about the the inheritance of the [[Royal Locks\|Royal Locks]] to be “superstitious nonsense”. [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] noted that this was intended to be a hint that there is something odd happening with the royal line of [[Idris\|Idris]], but that he won’t be able to address it unless he writes a sequel.
