**Morriumur** is a [[Dione\|dione]] who lives on [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]]. They are a draft and have only been alive for a few months. They join the Starsight Fleet to try and prove that their aggressive nature can be of benefit to their family.

## Appearance and Personality
Morriumur is two months old with their face being split down the center, the right being a crimson color while the left is a blue shade. Because they are a dione, they are expected to be non-aggressive, but the current draft of their personality is very aggressive by dione standards. They feel that they have to prove themself and fear being re-drafted because they do not wish to forget their friends. They were given their callsign, Complains, by [[Spensa\|Spensa]], but instead are just called by their name.

## Attributes and Abilities
Morriumur is a draft, and because of their dual-minded nature they are immune to the hallucinations of a [[Delver\|delver's]] maze.
