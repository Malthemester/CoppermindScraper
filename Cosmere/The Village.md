The **Terris Village**, or simply **the Village**, is a Terris settlement within the city of [[Elendel\|Elendel]] in [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. Located in the Fifth Octant, it serves as the center of Terris society and culture within the city.
The Village is in an area of the city where the fertile soil of the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] is allowed to thrive untamed, giving the Village a forest-like appearance. 
There is an agreement between the [[Synod\|Synod]] and the Elendel government that grants a degree of autonomy to the Terris residents of the Village, allowing the Terris to police themselves without the interference of the local constabulary.
