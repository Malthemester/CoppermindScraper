## History
Lady [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] worked as an intern for Daius. He was the senior prosecutor of [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter's]] trial. Daius was successful in getting Miles put to death for his crimes. He advised against Marasi attending the execution, though she decided to go anyway. Daius himself never attended executions.
Marasi's time at her internship with Daius made her realize that she would rather work as a constable. Marasi did not like the sense of competition and the chaos of the prosecutor's office.
