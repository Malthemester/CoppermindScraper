## Appearance and Personality
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], Yunfah can change his shape and size like any other honorspren. To [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], he appears as tiny old man with a long beard flying on a small cloud.
Yunfah doesn't seem to be affected much by the death of his bonded Radiant. Like other honorspren, Yunfah too likes hierarchy and considers Kaladin his superior. He detests the idea of bonding with a [[Singer\|singer]], even one fighting against [[Odium\|Odium]]. According to Syl, Yunfah loves the Physical Realm and doesn't want to return to [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Being an honorspren, Yunfah can form a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with a willing human. This bond gives the bonded human access to the [[Surges\|Surges]] of the [[Order of Windrunners\|Order of Windrunners]], namely [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]] and [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]].

## History
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Yunfah was among the honorspren who left Shadesmar, against the will of senior honorspren, to bond humans.
He later bonded Vratim, making them a Windrunner. Vratim later died during a battle.
A few months later Kaladin ordered Yunfah to try bonding with [[Rlain\|Rlain]] within ten days, to which Yunfah reluctantly agreed. Later, Rlain rejected the bond viewing it as 'forced'.
