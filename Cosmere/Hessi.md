**Hessi** is a scholar and author on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is the author of *Mythica*, a work which investigates historical information about the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] and explores their characteristics.

## History
For more information, see [[Mythica\|Mythica]].
Hessi was presumably alive on Roshar during the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]; she was a contemporary of [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] and [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] mentioned that *Mythica* was a recent work. Shallan told [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] about some of Hessi's controversial hypotheses in the book, noting that *Mythica* was poorly received and was hard to find. Hessi herself knew that aspects of *Mythica* would be contentious, such as her assertions that the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] were still alive and that [[Moelach\|Moelach]] was responsible for [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattles]]. Subsequent events proved Hessi to be correct on a number of occasions, indicating that Hessi was a gifted researcher, as she was apparently able to meet the challenge of separating fact from fiction in the many tales and stories about the Unmade.

## Trivia
Selections from Mythica are used as the epigraphs for part four of *Oathbringer*.
