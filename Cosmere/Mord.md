**Mord** is a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] resident of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Mord likely came from a family of farmers, as he was among a group of youths (also including [[Jost\|Jost]], [[Jest\|Jest]], [[Tift\|Tift]], [[Naget\|Naget]], and [[Khav\|Khav]]) that was tasked with removing [[Diggerworm\|diggerworms]] from the [[Lavis\|lavis]] fields outside of Hearthstone. He hung out with the same group of boys after work hours were over, and once witnessed a fight between Kaladin and Jost.
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] cited his name as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' name, unlike his own.
