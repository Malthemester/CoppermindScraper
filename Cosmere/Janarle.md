**Janarle** is a noble from the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
He served [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]] as a general and took part in the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]]. While Straff is indisposed Janarle effectively leads the army and planned a strike to be executed with Straff's permission. He continues to report the progress of the koloss attack against Luthadel. Straff believed that he might overthrow him if given the knowledge that [[Zane\|Zane]] had disappeared. After Straff was killed in the final battle of that siege, Janarle bowed to the [[New Empire\|New Empire]]. After the battle, he tries to argue that they should concentrate their forces on cementing their hold on the Northern dominance. Henceforward he would be the king of the Northern Dominance, administrating from [[Urteau\|Urteau]].
As Quellion began to revolt against the New Empire, Janarle fled from Urteau. On his way through the Northern Dominance he was attacked by [[Koloss\|koloss]] and was transformed into one. He took part in the [[Battle of Hathsin\|Battle of Hathsin]] as a koloss. As he did not make it to the front lines, he likely died when the sun rose and began burning the land.
