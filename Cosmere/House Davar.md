**House Davar** is a small [[Veden\|Veden]] family living in [[Valam princedom\|Valam princedom]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
 by  zoethatcher art 
The Davar family live on an estate in Valam princedom and are known for mining. After their father's death, the Davar children learned that their father had been creating new quarries using a [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] until the [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] broke.
[[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]] and [[Shallan's mother\|Lady Davar]] had five children; [[Helaran\|Helaran]], [[Balat\|Balat]], [[Jushu\|Jushu]], [[Wikim\|Wikim]] and [[Shallan\|Shallan]].
At the age of eleven Shallan begins manifesting [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities and her mother attempts to kill her, leading to her own death which Lin takes the blame for. Shallan blanks out the experience and blames her father with everyone else. This strain on Lin causes him to become harsh and abusive towards his children. He eventually exiles Helaran, and then kills his second wife [[Malise Gevelmar\|Malise Gevelmar]]. After he threatens to kill Balat, Shallan poisons and then throttles Lin. During this time [[Helaran\|Helaran]] engages in a battle against [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]] and is killed by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]].
After the [[Battle of Vedenar\|Battle of Vedenar]] and the death of Highprince Valam, the surviving brothers travel to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to meet [[Shallan\|Shallan]]. They arrive in the days after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the day of Shallan's wedding to [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]].
