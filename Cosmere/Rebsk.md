>“*...despite what the papers said, the ship was not Rysn's. She owned it. She commanded it. But at least according to maritime tradition, it was not hers.*”
\-Rysn's thoughts on the position of rebsk[1]


**Rebsk** is a term for a shipmaster or owner that originates from [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] merchant ships on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is capitalized if used as a title.
A rebsk hangs a symbolic captain's cord with their colors to denote their position. When a rebsk is present on their ship, the captain follows certain formalities, such as welcoming the rebsk on board and asking for an indication that the voyage can officially begin. Traditionally, a respected rebsk may begin a voyage by taking a turn at the helm, although they are not otherwise involved in sailing the ship. The captain defers to the rebsk in matters of planning the route and any on-shore expeditions; they also keep the rebsk apprised of any issues that may arise during the journey. Although the captain is generally in command of the operation of the ship, it is within the rebsk's rights to give orders regarding the crew.

>“*Pardon, but you did what any good rebsk would do. A rebsk worthy of this crew.*”
\-Captain Drlwan to Rysn[2]

Although the rebsk owns the ship according to its documentation, it is another matter to earn the respect of the crew. The nature of the title creates a distance between the rebsk and the crew, who often view their rebsk as "more unapproachable than an officer." For example, the privilege of a turn at the helm is only extended to the rebsk by the captain after the rebsk has proven themselves deserving of the esteem of the crew, an undertaking that may requires years of interaction. Additionally, if a rebsk that has not yet earned respect comes into conflict with the captain, it can potentially upset the balance of power on the ship.
