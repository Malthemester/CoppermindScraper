**Destroyer** is a horse owned by a young [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] during his initial adventures in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Wax gave her the name "Destroyer" in an attempt to inspire her, as she had a placid nature. He tried to train her to come when he whistled, but she tended to ignore him.
