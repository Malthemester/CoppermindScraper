**Taraco** was a bandit in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], considered to be one of the greatest bandits of the age.
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] captured Taraco because he had robbed a cobbler a few days earlier, and Wax hoped to get a new pair of boots out of it. It was commonly thought that Wax went after Taraco because Taraco had shot a lawkeeper in [[Faradana\|Faradana]] the week before. In truth, Wax did not hear of the lawkeeper's death until he had brought Taraco in to face justice.
Wax tells the truth behind his capture of Taraco to convince [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] that his heroics look different from his perspective.
