>“*Instead you go chasing humans. Losing your mind. Going to fight?*”
\-Unativi to Ua'pam[1]


**Unativi** is a [[Peakspren\|peakspren]] sailor in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is the cousin of [[Ua'pam\|Ua'pam]], another peakspren bonded to [[Zu (Roshar)\|Zu]]. He runs a barge and has some skill in manifesting goods via [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]].

## Appearance and Personality
Unativi is bald, like other peakspren, with more cracks on the head than the other parts of body. He likes to wear a hat. His deep cracks in his skin emanate a molten light which varies in intensity.
Unativi doesn't trust humans. He doesn't approve of Ua'pam bonding to Zu and believes that he can run from the conflict when [[Odium\|Odium's]] war reaches Shadesmar.

## History
In 1175, Unativi brought his barge to sail the human envoy from [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] stronghold of [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. He refused to take the group all the way to Lasting Integrity, instead sailing them to [[Nameless\|Nameless]] and leaving them there.
Unativi used part of his crew's payment of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to manifest goods from the ocean of beads. He got his cousin Ua'pam to help him with the task and berated him for running off to fight instead of working with the crew on the barge. After reaching Nameless, Unativi left the barge with Shallan while he and the crew looked for supplies. On his way back to the barge, he met and talked with the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] [[Notum\|Notum]].
