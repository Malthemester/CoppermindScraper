**Deathpoint** is an [[Epic\|Epic]].
He is killed by [[David\|David's]] father on the [[Day of Annexation\|Day of Annexation]].
He was tall and lean, but solid. He was muscled and toned in a way that could be seen through his clothes.
He has the ability to disintegrate living things by pointing at them, though their bones were always left unharmed. Worn items (like a holstered gun or a swaddling blanket) also appear to be unaffected. He is also speculated to have a second ability, one that was never shown, but appears to require physical contact and can be assumed to be more powerful than his first, as he attempts to use it on Steelheart despite his first being ineffective.
