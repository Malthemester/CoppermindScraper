**Gill** is a hyperslug [[Taynix\|taynix]] that [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] discovers in a cavern on [[Detritus\|Detritus]] along with several other taynix. Gill is of the yellow and blue variety of taynix, meaning he can use his [[Cytonics\|Cytonic]] abilities to teleport. Gill is the first taynix besides [[Doomslug\|Doomslug]] that [[Freyja Marten\|FM]] ever sees, and at first she mistakes Gill for Doomslug.
Gill has blue markings down the side of his face that almost look like gills, which leads to FM naming him Gill. Gill has a quieter voice than Doomslug, at least some of the time.
Gill teleports out of his crate many times, at one point teleporting right in the middle of [[Cobb\|Admiral Cobb]]’s holoprojection. Gill goes with [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] on their rescue mission to [[Sunreach (station)\|Sunreach]]. With Jorgen’s direction, Gill uses his cytonic abilities to teleport into [[Sadie\|Sadie]]’s starfighter and bring her into the station, saving her.
