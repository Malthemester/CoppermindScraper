This article discusses material removed from the final book

**Eton**, frequently referred to as the **Mad Prince**, was a secondary antagonist in the early drafts of *Elantris*. His role in the story was largely filled in the published book by Duke [[Telrii\|Telrii]].
Eton, Prince [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] brother, was mentioned periodically in the first three quarters of the book, as an irrational man and a potential embarrassment to the court, whom King [[Iadon\|Iadon]] sent off to a distant plantation some time before the book began. In his youth Eton enjoyed holding mock battles with peasants, and often tormented Raoden. Raoden eventually adapted and learned to best his cruel brother, laying the groundwork for his political maneuvering with his father as a young man.
In the final act of the book, Eton arrives in Kae with an army. [[Sarene\|Sarene]] first sees him after she emerges from [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], when he rides up to the palace with a dozen soldiers, announces his claim on the throne, and sets the palace on fire. Later he meets with Hrathen, agreeing to convert to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and unsettling Hrathen with the calm manner in which he contradicts both logic and himself. Hrathen and Eton meet again, and Hrathen attempts to make some progress on his goals as Eton forces him to play Stones, a game Eton claims is wildly popular but Hrathen is confident exists only in Eton's mind. Hrathen leaves the meeting increasingly frustrated.
Eton is assassinated, and his soldiers show up to try Raoden for causing Eton's death. Sarene accompanies Raoden to the trial, held next to Eton's pyre. Raoden accepts responsibility for Eton's death and makes an impassioned speech. Eton's general raises his sword to execute Raoden, closes his eyes, and swings, missing Raoden's neck by less than an inch. He explains that Eton always made his soldiers perform executions with closed eyes: a hit meant guilt, and a miss meant the accused had been innocent all along. The general declares Raoden innocent, and Raoden prepares for his coronation.
