## Appearance and Anatomy
 by  Isaac Stewart  A depiction of the five stages of life for a chull: Larva (chull cremling), first Pupation, Adult, second Pupation, and Senescence.
Chulls are massive crustaceans with thick legs with large claws and a stone-like shell. Their carapaces are typically red. Chulls have whip-like antennae that grow in pace with their shell as they age, so that the chull can sense out spaces to determine if they're large enough to pass through, and beady fist-size black eyes.
Chull shells are a light, porous stone created from minerals the chull consumes in its food and water and then excretes.
Since the shell is not alive, chulls are not hurt when their shells are cracked or shaped. In the wild, there are often plants growing in the crevices of a chull's shell. Chulls pull their legs and head into their shell when they sleep, and as a result sleeping chulls look like large boulders or small hills.
The [[Reshi\|Reshi]], and likely others, paint their chulls' shells. One can identify what island a Reshi chull handler is from by the colors and patterns on their chulls' shells.

## Behavior
Chulls are generally docile creatures. They have claws that are said to be strong enough to break a man's arm, but it is very unusual for them to behave aggressively. They tend to move with a slow, lumbering gait and are generally slower than humans.
They are capable of making a wide range of noises, including a gravelly bleating, trumpeting, and snorting.
Chulls are omnivorous creatures. They eat everything from [[Rockbud\|rockbuds]] to slugs to smaller crustaceans. Domestic chulls are often fed grain.
Chulls are considered less intelligent that horses and in some cases, stubborn.
Chulls breed by way of laying eggs.

## Training
There are several different methods of training chull.

In the rural areas of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], chulls are harnessed and controlled with complex leather bridles.
In the coastal region around [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], chull drivers often sit directly on the chull's shell and direct them by tapping on their antennae with long poles.
Some chulls are trained to respond to different rhythms tapped out on their shells with a guiding reed. These reeds are often as long as a person is tall and allow the driver to drive from the wagon or cart rather than riding on the chull itself.
## Use
 by  creativityinajar 
Chull are highly valued as work animals and are considered to be worth more than the average slave. Some people maintain chull herds and rent their labor out on a contract basis.They are slow but strong and are used to pull everything up to and including the large complex bridges [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] uses for chasm crossings. Since their shells can be carved without harming the animal, some people sand flat places on top of a chull to ride and many carts are hooked to fittings drilled directly into their shells. Shelves and racks can also be carved into or attached directly to chull shells.
Since it is lightweight and durable, chull shell is used as a crafting material. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] had a [[Havah\|havah]] with chull-shell buttons.
Chull meat is edible. It can be dried and stored as jerky. In some cultures, including [[Herdazian\|Herdazian]] and [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]], chull head is considered a delicacy.
[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] uses them to pull his bridges, rather than put the lives of [[Bridgemen\|bridgemen]] at risk.
