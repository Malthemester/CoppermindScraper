\-Gangnah speaking of the humans[2]


**Gangnah** is a [[Listener\|listener]] elder and foremost member of their ruling council on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
Gangnah was a member of the Five during [[Eshonai\|Eshonai's]] days of exploration and the beginning of [[Venli\|Venli's]] search for new forms. She and the other elders heard both Eshonai's plea to unify the listeners and Venli's petition to try to adopt warform from the [[Painspren\|painspren]] she had trapped in a [[Topaz\|topaz]]. Gangnah expressed appreciation for Eshonai's efforts in her expedition and wished that the listeners did have a more unified government. After receiving doubtful comments from some of the other elders, Eshonai asked for permission to show the listeners her maps, thinking that her people would surely want to unite in the face of such a big world; after telling her that they would consider the matter more, Gangnah and the other four dismissed Eshonai and proceeded to interview Venli more closely.

\-Gangnah to Jasnah[3]

Gangnah attended the feast celebrating the signing of the peace treaty between the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] and the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. She, [[Varnali\|Varnali]], and [[Klade\|Klade]] remained behind in the wake of [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] [[Assassination of Gavilar\|assassination]] of the Alethi king, [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]]. She confessed her responsibility for Gavilar's death to Brightlady [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], but offered no explanation beyond that they were attempting to avoid the return of their gods. Gangnah and the other two were hanged for their crime.
