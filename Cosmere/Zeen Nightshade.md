**Zeen Nightshade** callsign **Chaser** is a former [[DDF\|DDF]] pilot.

## Attributes and Abilities
He is a skilled [[Starfighter\|starfighter]] pilot and a [[Cytonics\|cytonic]].

## History
Shortly before the [[Battle of Alta\|Battle of Alta]], he was with Spensa on the surface when he noticed unusual debris falls that turn out to be Krell attack. Upon call, he joined the fight. Near the end of the fight, he started to act erratically. He first seemed to be able to react to Krell fighters before they acted. Then, he flew out from an opening of the debris field, to where the Krell came from. After a while, he returned and started to fire at friendly ships. Realizing he was maddened, [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]] ordered him shot down by [[Cobb\|Cobb]], his wingmate. Afterwards, he was known to public not as a turncoat but as a deserter. This also caused Spensa to be branded as "the daughter of a coward." By the time of Spensa's mission to [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]], it is relatively well-known, at least in the DDF, that he only did so because the Krell had used his cytonic abilities to make him think that he was firing on enemies and the DDF begins taking precautions to make sure that other cytonic pilots cannot be influenced in that manner again.
