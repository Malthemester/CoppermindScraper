**Raoden's mother** was a woman that lived in the city of [[Kae\|Kae]] in [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. She was stated to have an unyielding personality and insurmountable love for her son.

## History
When her son, [[Raoden\|Raoden]], had sustained an injury as a result of a big fall. She and her husband, [[Iadon\|Iadon]], sought the best medical professionals but none were able to cease the spread of Raoden's infection without risking amputating his leg. With very few options left and against her husband's wishes, she brought Raoden to Elantris where an Elantrian medic was able to completely heal her son's wound.  She eventually died two years before the [[Reod\|Reod]] occurred.
