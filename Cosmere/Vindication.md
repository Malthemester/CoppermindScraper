**Vindication** is a specialized revolver on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] designed and built by [[Ranette\|Ranette]]. It is used by [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]].

## Design
Vindication is a sleek revolver with a long barrel. It is made of a silvery metal called [[Invarian steel\|Invarian steel]], and it is highly polished. It does not use [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] in its construction due to cost. It has a grip styled with wavy lines of ivory and onyx separated by metal bands.
The gun has eight chambers and can be loaded with six ordinary bullets and two larger "hazekiller rounds" designed to fight [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]]. The gun will normally fire the six standard bullets and skip the two chambers that hold the hazekiller rounds. Pulling a lever on the grip and spinning the hammer locks it onto the additional chambers. Since Invarian steel is stronger and lighter than ordinary steel, it allows for thinner chamber walls, so the revolver remains reasonably sized. It also has an "Allomancer-only" safety; a hidden internal switch that only a [[Misting\|Misting]] or [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] can see or access via an [[Iron\|ironpull]] or a [[Steel\|steelpush]]. The safety disables the gun, making it nearly impossible to turn it on its owner. Ranette later used a similar internal latch design on the third version of her grappling hook devices.

## History
Wax visited Ranette's shop in 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]] seeking a new [[Sterrion 36\|Sterrion 36]], after losing his [[Ambersair\|Ambersair]] revolver. However, Ranette instead showed Wax the hazekiller rounds and Vindication, which she had likely developed specifically for him. Wax was suitably impressed, and Ranette was unusually proud of her work; she named the gun after the Ascendant Warrior, [[Vin\|Vin]]. Ranette "loaned" Wax the gun and ammunition on the condition that he provided a field report. Wax—who referred to Vindication using female pronouns—usually carried it in his shoulder holster. He continued to carry (and use) other guns, but Vindication immediately became his primary weapon.
Wax used the gun against the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] when interrupting their train heist and it performed admirably; it was highly accurate, even allowing him to shoot a bundle of dynamite falling from the sky. However, Wax dropped Vindication in the resulting explosion. It was recovered by [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]], who searched the Vanishers hideout for it afterwards.
Wax continued to carry Vindication for the next few years. He successfully used a hazekiller round to injure the [[Marksman\|Marksman]]. He nearly shot [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] with it at [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]] and later injured her using a [[Pewterarm\|Pewterarm]] round. As the search for Bleeder continued, [[Wayne\|Wayne]] picked up a single hazekiller-caliber bullet from Ranette that Wax had asked her to forge in such a manner that it would not shatter. During Wax's final confrontation with Bleeder, he temporarily lost Vindication, but he was able to retrieve it and shoot her in the head with the special bullet. Wax had secretly asked Ranette to forge the bullet with [[Wax's earring\|his earring]] so that it would function as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike and give [[Harmony\|Harmony]] control over Bleeder.
Wax wore Vindication to his interrupted wedding to [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]]. He used it extensively during the [[Set\|Set's]] attack on his train to [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. He carried Vindication throughout his time in New Seran, except when he had to reluctantly check it during [[Kelesina Shores's party\|Kelesina Shores's party]]. He used it again during the confrontations with the Set in [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] and at the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]].
