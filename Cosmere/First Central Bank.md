The **First Central Bank** is a bank in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]] at one time owns a large stake in it. It is presumably located in the First Octant.
One of the coins used in Elendel has the image of the bank stamped on its back.

## Appearance
The front of the bank has an intimidating set of stone steps with pillars on either side. The gas-lit lobby has a low ceiling with a wall of cagelike bars separating the patrons from the tellers. The floor is covered by a mold colored rug and has dark wood furnishings.

## History
Around 311 [[Catacendre\|PC]], when [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] was twelve years old, his uncle [[Edwarn\|Edwarn]] brought him to the First Central Bank to teach him about banking. Edwarn and Wax observed two men seeking a loan, a poor man named [[Jendel\|Jendel]] and a wealthy man named [[Nikolin\|Nikolin]]. Edwarn told Wax that most banks would only lend money to Nikolin. However, he had instituted a policy wherein his bank would loan money to riskier debtors, but with unfavorable loan terms such as extremely high interest rates and potential . Edwarn had also marketed aggressively to people that would not normally qualify for a loan. Edwarn and his colleagues had effectively invented  in Elendel.
Upon hearing about the draconian terms of the contract that Jendel was about to sign, Wax intervened. He attempted to give Jendel a rare, valuable coin that Edwarn had just gifted him. Jendel did not accept the coin, not believing that someone would give him something so valuable. Edwarn was incensed, but was able to smoothly convince Jendel to sign the loan papers anyway. Jendel was not able to fulfill the loan terms, and committed suicide by jumping off a bridge eight years later. His sons remained indebted to the bank after his death.
Wax recounted the story of what he saw in the bank on that day to [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] after [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] sent him a message on the rare coin that Jendel had refused. He told Steris that the incident with Jendel was one of the factors that drove him to leave the unscrupulous, bureaucratic environment of Elendel to seek adventure in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]].
Edwarn sold his house's share in the bank for capital sometime before he faked his death.
