\-Wax on Paclo's bravery[1]

**Paclo**, sometimes referred to as **Paclo the Dusty** was a deputy lawman under [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] in the town of [[Weathering\|Weathering]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Paclo was Wax's deputy before Wax met [[Wayne\|Wayne]]. He was a very jumpy man, easily startled into shouting by something as quiet as a softly closed door. However, he was a very brave man, who did not hesitate to run into danger. Wax spoke of Paclo in a past tense, implying that Paclo was dead.
