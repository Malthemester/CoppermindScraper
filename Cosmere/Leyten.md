## History
### Bridge Four
Leyten was an apprentice armorer prior to becoming a bridgemen. The armor of a lighteyes broke, allowing an arrow to hit in the shoulder, and the blame fell on Leyten. As a result, he was demoted to work on the bridge crews.
On the first bridge run after [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] promotion to bridgeleader, Leyten dropped after taking two arrow wounds in his shoulder and the opposite arm. Another arrow grazed his stomach and his left leg was trampled by a horse. [[Teft\|Teft]] and [[Rock\|Rock]] carried Leyten to Kaladin, who insisted on treating his wounds. Leyten fell unconscious and Kaladin feared he wouldn‚Äôt make it. However, he still pulled the arrows free from his arms and cauterized the wounds, then splinted Leyten‚Äôs leg using the arrow shafts and cauterized that wound as well, saving the man‚Äôs life. The crew brought him back to the barracks by tying him to the top of their bridge while they ran and then quickly untying him before the army crossed.
Leyten‚Äôs wounds soon became infected, causing Kaladin to enlist Rock and Teft to help collect [[Knobweed\|knobweed]] sap for its antiseptic qualities. The knobweed sap worked, and soon Leyten was up and about, though he initially had a lot of trouble walking due to his crushed leg.
Leyten‚Äôs condition continued to improve, even joining the rest of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] in the chasms for spear training and harvesting. After the success of using the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] carapace armor, Leyten was tasked with crafting additional sets for every man in Bridge Four. He expertly crafted it to fit on their current leather jerkins and caps, along with arm and shin guards to match. Leyten insisted on ornamenting the helms with ridges and cuts, as well as cutting the breastplates and guards in toothlike patterns.

### Dalinar's Army (1173‚Äî)
After the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], Leyten joined [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]‚Äôs army along with the rest of the bridgemen. He continued working on armor, fixing issues as gear arrived from the quartermaster. He also assisted in guarding the various members of [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]]. In the mornings, Leyten trained with [[Natam\|Natam]] and a few others. When Kaladin gave [[Shen\|Shen]] a spear, he encouraged the parshmen to train with Leyten and Natam, who were willing to teach him. When [[Renarin\|Renarin]] joined [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]], Leyten helped teach him how to carry a bridge.
Leyten was one of the bridgemen were was guarding Dalinar when [[Rlain\|Rlain]] surrendered himself to the [[Alethi\|Alethi]]. He survived the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and the [[Battle of Narak\|preceding battle]]. At [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], he was among the members of Bridge Four who accompanied [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] when she confronted [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]]. He was shaken by the event and had nightmares about it for some time.
He became a [[Squire\|squire]] to [[Kaladin Stormblessed\|Kaladin Stormblessed]] at some point during their training, and so he participated in the running competition that [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] held to test the benefits of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. He was one of the slowest due to stopping for food during the run. Alongside his training, he kept on handling the supply, but as organization of the [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]] was a mess, he couldn't deal with all the requisition orders.
Leyten presumably fought in the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] and the preceding battle in defense of Urithiru along with the rest of Bridge Four present.
Leyten went on a mission to [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. He reported a strange weather pattern around the island as well as swarms of strange small shadows (later discovered to be [[Sleepless\|hordelings]] that had bred with [[Larkin\|larkin]]) hovering in the clouds, but was unsure if they were alive or were spren. One came from behind and drained him of his Stormlight. He subsequently fell in the ocean and had to be rescued by [[Lyn\|Lyn]] and [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]].
He also accompanies the *Fourth Bridge* on its expedition to [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]], defending the airship against the [[Fused\|Fused]] assault along with a dozen other Windrunners. Later, he goes with [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] on his trip to find [[Ishar\|Ishar]], and finds that he and the other four Windrunners are no match for Ishar's power as Ishar tethers all five to the stone with a "glowing rope that drained the Stormlight out."

## Trivia
Leyten is based on a friend in Brandon's writing group named Alan.
