**Snarlbrush** is a plant native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is known to grow in northwestern [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], near [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]].
It is a robust plant that grows in dense thickets around large [[Markel\|markel]] trees; the trees and the tight grouping of the plants help to provide some protection from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]].
Snarlbrush is typically tan or brown colored, to the point that the plants appear to be dead. When they get wet, they instantly turn verdant green at the point of contact, then slowly fade back to brown as the water is absorbed deep into their branches. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] recalls [[Lirin\|Lirin]] telling him about this unusual property.
