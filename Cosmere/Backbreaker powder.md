**Backbreaker powder** is a very strong poison used on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Usage
Backbreaker powder is a very lethal tasteless, white powder. There is an antidote for backbreaker powder that is capable of counteracting all the poison's effects. A large amount of backbreaker powder is capable of killing the person that ingests it in mere seconds unless the antidote is taken.
When dusted over bread, backbreaker powder can be disguised as flour.

## History
In 1173, [[Ardent\|Ardent]] [[Kabsal\|Kabsal]], a member of the [[Ghostblood\|Ghostbloods]], tried to assassinate Princess [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] with backbreaker powder. He sprinkled it over bread like flour, and put the antidote in the jam, which Jasnah dislikes. For months, he failed to persuade her to ever try the bread. However, after Brightlady [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] was hospitalized following her first Soulcasting, Shallan convinced Jasnah to try the poisoned bread.
However, Jasnah was able to avoid ingesting the poison by [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] the bread as she consumed it. She also Soulcast the jam as well, as an extra precaution, unaware that the antidote was in the jam. Kabsal's plan went awry, and instead of Jasnah, he and [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] were poisoned, while the antidote in the jam had inadvertently been Soulcast away. Jasnah saved Shallan by Soulcasting her blood to remove the poison, but Kabsal died.
