**Ton** is an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Singer\|singer]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who was freed by the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].

## History
Ton was a member of the band of former [[Parshmen\|parshmen]] that [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] encountered during the buildup to the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]. Ton was involved in a discussion with [[Khen\|Khen]] and others about what to do with Kaladin after he was taken captive. Ton asked Khen if she would be able to kill Kaladin, and Khen responded that she would if she thought doing so was necessary to maintain her freedom. Kaladin was disquieted by the fact that Ton and the rest of the group had Alethi names and accents.
Kaladin later saw Khen and [[Sah\|Sah]] during the battle at [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]]; Ton was not mentioned but likely participated in the battle.
