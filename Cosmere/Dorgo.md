>“*“Listen, Spin, you don’t have a shield. Do you understand? The system was burned out completely, and we ripped it free. You are totally exposed. Other than the shield, your acclivity ring is going to be your biggest worry. It’s on the fritz, and I can’t say if it will cut out or not. Control sphere also got a write-up in our assessment. Eject still works.”*”

He is familiar with the pilots of Alta Base, knowing [[Spensa\|Spensa]] by sight, and knowing detail about Callsign: [[Vigor\|Vigor's]] history in the DDF. He often works with [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]], and with Spensa's [[Poco\|Poco]] in particular. He's part of the team responsible for dismantling Skyward Five, [[Arturo\|Arturo's]] ship, after it was severely damaged.
Dorgo has some level of authority, giving the go ahead to allow Spensa to take off in Arturo's damaged ship during the [[Second Battle of Alta\|Second Battle of Alta]], despite no official orders from [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]].
