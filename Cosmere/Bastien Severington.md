## History
### Pewternauts
Bilming was an important port city, and Severington worked with [[Florin Malin\|Florin Malin]] to develop warships known as "[[Pewternaut\|Pewternauts]]" with armored hulls and gun turrets. The new ships were revealed in 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], and Severington invited a number of senators from [[Elendel\|Elendel]] to their introduction as a gesture of friendship, likely hoping to quell some rising bitterness between the two cities. However, one of the senators was later quoted in *The New Ascendancy* mocking the ships.

### Criticizing Elendel
Later in 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores]] invited Severington to speak at [[Kelesina Shores' party\|her party]] in [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. Severington's speech focused on Elendel's "tyranny" and supposedly unfair taxation, going so far as to draw a comparison to the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. Severington used [[Sophi Tarcsel\|Sophi Tarcsel's]] amplification devices to give the speech, allowing [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] to overhear parts of it despite being indisposed in another room. Wax realized that Bilming was important enough to spearhead anti-Elendel sentiment that could result in civil war.
