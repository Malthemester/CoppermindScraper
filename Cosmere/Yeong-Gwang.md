The *Yeong-Gwang* was a ship in the old fleet which carried humanity to [[Detritus\|Detritus]].
The residents and descendants are known as **Yeongian**, and are mostly ethnically Chinese or Korean.
After landing, they formed a clan and used their hydroponics knowledge to become underground farmers in a cavern close to Igneous. The food grown by this clan is of high value and is only available to those who have multiple achievement or industry merits. [[Bim\|Bim]] is from that clan.

## Trivia
The name of the starship is likely a reference to the South Korean poet , who is famous for writing about the pain and trials of youth.
Yeong-Gwang (영광) also means glory or honor in Korean.
