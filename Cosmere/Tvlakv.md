>“*I didn't say Tvlakv isn't a bastard. He's just a likable bastard. Those are the worst kind. When you kill them, you end up feeling guilty for it.*”
\-Kaladin to Sylphrena, on Tvlakv[1]


**Tvlakv** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] slave trader on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is a rounded man with brown eyes and a faint limp. As a Thaylen, his beard and eyebrows are stark white, contrasting with the black hair on his head. He wears clothing that was once fine, though it has since grown ragged. He is also described as portly.

## History
He has been previously married, a number of times.
He brought Kaladin and a number of other slaves to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], where he sold them in [[Shattered Plains\|Sadeas's warcamp]] for use in their [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]]. In a manner consistent with his unscrupulous ways, though, he claimed that none of the slaves had paid down any of their debt.
Months after selling [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] into slavery, Tvlakv was in camp with [[Bluth\|Bluth]] and [[Tag\|Tag]] when [[Shallan\|Shallan]] approached and fell unconscious, exhausted from her time on her own after the shipwreck. He woke her up the next morning and told her that they would be leaving, and she requested to travel with them. In doing so, she turned them back around to travel back north to the Shattered Plains. During this time, he gave her a minimal amount of comfort and care in order to make her more dependent upon his services, not even affording her proper shoes. Although she originally thought to use him as an escort, he instead thought that he would be selling her off to the ones who are expecting her at the Shattered Plains.

>“*It was a flat-out lie. However, after six days of travelling together, she had discovered that Tvlakv didn't much mind being caught in a lie.*”
\-Shallan's impression of Tvlakv[5]

During her first confrontation with him, Shallan mentioned that if he did as requested and took her safely to the Shattered Plains, he would "be freed." Although she was guessing at the time, it appears that she guessed well and that he had been in some kind of deep debt or indentured servitude. After being told to "stuff his schemes deep in a crevice", he did exactly that, and planned no more to betray her.
After they begin being chased by [[Vathah\|Vathah]] and his band of deserters, Tvlakv suggested pulling off and allowing them to attack the richer bounty ahead as a distraction, but was overruled by Shallan. His caravan went up as far as the spot of the earlier battle, where they met [[Tyn\|Tyn]] and [[Macob\|Macob]] and noticed the deserters were advancing upon them.
At this stage, [[Shallan\|Shallan]] took off to recruit these men to their side. Tvlakv survived the battle, after which [[Shallan\|Shallan]] took the five slaves remaining to him, and bought the now-surplus wagon for five [[Spheres\|sapphire broams]], though she left him his [[Parshmen\|parshmen]]. Incredibly insulted, Tvlakv left to return south again.
