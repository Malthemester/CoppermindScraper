>‚Äú*The Honor Chasm, the bridgemen called it, for it was the place where they could make the one decision left to them. The honorable decision. Death.*‚Äù
\-Kaladin's thoughts on the chasm.[1]


**Honor Chasm** is a chasm in the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It begins narrow but becomes wider and deeper as it runs east. The edge of the chasm is down an incline. Six ladders are set up to allow bridgemen to go down into the chasms.
It is located a short distance from [[Shattered Plains\|Sadeas's warcamp]].
It is the only place that [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas']] [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]] are allowed to visit unsupervised. The bridgemen use it to commit suicide. Gaz prefers that the bridgemen leave their sandals and vest behind if they choose to go to the Honor Chasm so he will not have to send someone down to fetch the clothing.
