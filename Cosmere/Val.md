For the character in the Reckoners universe nicknamed Val, see [[Valentine\|Valentine]].
The **Val** is a class of [[Starfighter\|starfighter]] used by scout teams in the [[DDF\|DDF]].
Val-class fighters are not heavily armed, as they are designed for scanner avoidance and speed. They have a single 131 Stewart [[Destructor\|destructor]]; larger ships carry as many as four destructors, often using the more powerful 138 Stewart model. The scanning sensors on the Val-class have a longer range and are more sensitive to detail than those used on other DDF ships.
The members of [[Ranger Flight\|Ranger Flight]] fly Val-class ships.
