>“* This ship is filled with enigmas.*”
\- Professor Irich[1]


*Brunstell* is a [[Malwish\|Malwish]] [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship captained by [[Jordis\|Jordis]]. It is constructed of wood and is three stories tall. It has a broad, flat top with crenelated edges, like a castle's battlement. It is similar in appearance to a boat, but with wings. The hallways have intricate designs and decorations on the walls and ceilings. It is likely powered by Southern Scadrian [[Allomancy\|allomantic]] technology. It has an allomancy powered life boat called the *Wilg*.

## History
The *Brunstell* set off from Southern Scadrial on a mission to find the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]] and the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]]. It's crew had around one hundred members who refer to the ship with he/him/his pronouns. A storm caused it to crash in the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] town of [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] where its surviving crew were captured by the [[Set\|Set]]. A large walled compound was build around the crashed ship. Professor [[Irich\|Irich]] is studying the vessel in an attempt to understand its technology.
Professor Irich told visiting scientists Lady [[Stansi\|Stansi]] and Lord [[Stanoux\|Stanoux]] that the vessel has sophisticated plumbing. There are rooms whose purpose is a total mystery; a room with black hoods hanging from the ceiling, and another with what appear to be musical instruments which make no sound. There are restrooms for male and female genders, but also a third version with an unknown symbol.
In an attempt to interrogate the surviving crew, Irich had the members tortured and killed. More than half of the crew were killed in the crash and following imprisonment. [[Allik Neverfar\|Allik Neverfar]] survived and escaped aboard *Wilg* when he was rescued by [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]]. More than half of the crew were killed in the expedition.
