**Harkaylain** is a historical figure on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who lived during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]].

## History
A female [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]] mentioned Harkaylain to [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] when he appeared as [[Heb\|Heb]] in the Starfalls vision, which took place in the year 337 of the Eighth Epoch. Harkaylain was said to be able to predict [[Desolation\|Desolations]] with some accuracy.
Dalinar later revisited the Starfalls vision, this time embodying the female Radiant. Dalinar claimed that there was a problem with the Radiant's "living" [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], hoping that her companion, the [[Starfalls Windrunner\|Starfalls Windrunner]], would reveal some information about how it worked. However, the Windrunner told her to talk to Harkaylain or her [[Spren\|spren]] if she was having problems with her Plate.
The two Radiants each mentioned Harkaylain in a seemingly familiar manner, which may indicate that he is also a Knight Radiant, but this has not been confirmed.
