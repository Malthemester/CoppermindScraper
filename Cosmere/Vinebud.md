**Vinebud** is a type of [[Rockbud\|rockbud]] that can be found in many regions of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Description
For more images, see [[Vinebud/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Vinebud plants have an elastic, hollow stem. The stem normally has a cylindrical shape, but it can expand outward to accommodate the plant's retractable leaves, vine-like tendrils, and cone-like flowers. The plant retracts to protect itself from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] or nearby motion, and the stem takes on a bubble-like appearance when it stretches to accommodate the leaves and tendrils. Unlike common rockbuds, the vinebud appears to permanently root itself to the ground to avoid being blown around by the storms.
The leaves and tendrils of the vinebud are longer and more delicate than those of the common rockbud. The tendrils in particular extend far out of the plant and wave in the wind. [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] speculated that vinebud is related to [[Fingermoss\|fingermoss]], a smaller plant with a similar appearance.
Gardeners on Roshar have cultivated a variety of vinebud that does not retract back into its stem, although it retains a vestigial shell. It is used as a houseplant.

## Trivia
The design for vinebuds was based on the sea anemone.
