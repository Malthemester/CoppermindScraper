## Appearance and Personality
Little is known about Halam Khal's appearance. His eyes are [[Lighteyes\|light]], either yellow or violet depending on which of his parents he takes after. Like all [[Alethi\|Alethi]], he's tan. Even his kinsmen consider him tall.
Khal is a dependable soldier. His father trusts him with his set of [[Shardbearer\|Shards]], and often leaves him to act on his own, trusting--rightfully so--that the captain will succeed. Halam has been taught to take on any challenge that arises, even if the opponent is his superior. When not in battle or fulfilling other duties, he is usually seen close by his father's side.

## Attributes and Abilities
Halam is a trained soldier with considerable skill. He is present in most major engagements during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] and the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] and comes out of them essentially unscathed. He's also a trained [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]], and though he does not have [[Shardplate\|Plate]] or a [[Shardblade\|Blade]] of his own, he is skilled in using his father's weapons. It's possible, however, that [[General Khal\|General Khal]] ends up bestowing his own Plate on him, as following the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] others refer to Halam as a Shardbearer, and he is seen wearing his father's Plate far more often than his father is.
As his father's eldest son, Halam is the heir to the Khal lands, if they still exist.

## History
Nothing is known of Halam Khal's early life except that he was born to [[General Khal\|General Khal]] and Brightness [[Teshav\|Teshav]]. Like many Alethi brightlords, he joined the military, and by 1173 he reached the rank of captain. He was a member of the war party led by [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] out onto the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to fight the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. He fought in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] along with the less-skilled armies on Highprince [[Roion\|Roion's]] front. For this, his father lent him his own [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
Despite Captain Khal's best efforts, Roion's troops were routed by the Parshendi. Trapped and nearly overwhelmed, Halam was rescued when Brightlady [[Navani\|Navani's]] [[Artifabrian\|artifabrians]] put their moisture-attracting [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] into action, allowing archers to give Khal and his men cover as they retreated. Captain Khal returned from the front on foot, bearing [[Teleb\|Teleb's]] borrowed King's Blade, which he had recovered from the other man's corpse. He was sent to another part of the battlefield immediately upon his return.
Halam survived the battle and came to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with the rest of his family. At some point, the princess of [[Yezier\|Yezier]] began courting him, perhaps in hopes of tying her country to the [[House Kholin\|Kholins]] and their military. He and his father briefly visited [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], but before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] began, they transferred back to Urithiru to gather their soldiers and were subsequently stuck there when the tower came under attack from the [[Fused\|Fused]]. After that assault was pushed back, they led an Alethi relief force consisting of two thousand sodiers and three Shardbearers to aid Thaylen City. The captain survived that battle as well.

## Trivia
Halam goes unnamed throughout the entirety of *Words of Radiance*, being referred to only as "Captain Khal".
