**Getrue** is a [[Skaa\|skaa]] merchant and a member of the [[Luthadel Assembly\|Luthadel Assembly]] after the [[Collapse\|Collapse]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
Getrue has gained a lot of weight since the Collapse. Like all merchants in the Assembly, Getrue wears a very fine suit, seemingly even more refined than those worn by [[Noble\|nobles]]. He can be a pushover in the presence of stronger personalities.

## History
Getrue has known [[Philen Frandeu\|Philen Frandeu]] since the days of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], when Philen was known as "Lin"; Getrue is still prone to accidentally using that name.
After the Collapse, [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] abolished restrictions on skaa merchants. This allowed a number of skaa merchants and craftsmen, including Getrue, to suddenly become far more wealthy than had been possible during the Final Empire.
Getrue and Philen were chosen to serve in the Luthadel Assembly as two of the eight merchant representatives. Getrue seemed to like some of [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture's]] ideas, but he was heavily influenced by Philen's aggressive politics. The eight merchants typically voted in a bloc led by Philen, who opposed Elend and his idealistic policies. Philen believed that the merchants should no longer be considered skaa; he was highly motivated to gain a noble title and convinced the other merchants that this should be a key factor in their support of a ruler.
Getrue joined the rest of the Assembly in deposing Elend, although he later seemed to have some second thoughts about it. He was expected to vote with Philen to crown [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] as the new king, but the merchants ultimately voted for [[Ferson Penrod\|Ferson Penrod]] after he promised them more wealth and titles than Cett could offer, backed by [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]].
