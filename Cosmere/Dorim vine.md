**Dorim vines** are a type of flora native to the Dayside of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. The vines draw their water from the water table or some other subterranean source. For this reason, [[Deep sand\|deep sand]] is uninhabited by dorim vines.
Dorim vines carry a significant amount of water within themselves as a defense mechanism against certain creatures native to Dayside, such as [[Sandling\|sandlings]]. These creatures have terken skin or carapaces that dissolve if they come into contact with water.
Daysiders use dorim vines as a water source. Pouring water onto sand draws nearby vines out of the ground. Cutting the vine releases a flow of water. Fitting cut vines back together allows the vine to repair itself. Despite much of Dayside being covered in sand the regions where dorim vines grow are not considered desert.
