## Appearance and Personality
 by  Jamie Knierim 
Edwarn Ladrian is a round-faced, stocky man distinguished by a short, precisely trimmed beard, a beautifully tailored suit, and a cravat so narrow and thin, it lay flat like a bowtie loosened at the end of a long night.
He is usually wearing an extremely stylish and expensive suit of black silk with a turquoise vest. He also uses a whale-ivory cane. He doesn‚Äôt like the smell of cigars. Edwarn was very invested on the fortune of his house and had kept very good track of what his competitor houses had been shipping, still he ended up spending it to fund the Set.
He is a follower of [[Trellism\|Trellism]], a claim is made that he will deliver information to [[Wax\|Wax]] in relation to these beliefs, after which [[Ironeyes\|Ironeyes]] delivers a book for [[Wax\|Wax]]. When the red eyed [[Kandra\|Faceless Immortal]] comes to him he makes a claim stating that he will follow Trell.

## Attributes and Abilities
He is a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgist]] with three spikes, granting him the power of a [[Coinshot\|coinshot]], a [[Bloodmaker\|bloodmaker]], and a [[Chromium\|leecher]] respectively, due to the fact that having four or more Hemalurgic spikes would make one susceptible to Harmony's complete control.


## History
 by  Ben McSweeney 
Edwarn was [[Wax\|Wax's]] uncle, a descendant of [[Breeze\|Breeze]] and [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]], and was the fifteenth High Lord of [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]].
Before Edwarn faked his death, it was widely believed that he had wasted the family fortune through poor business deals while earning a meager sum betting on horse races. He was remembered as hermit-like save for his letters to the broadsheets about political matters, and had offended three-quarters of the city‚Äôs upper crust.
It was later revealed he had prepared [[Hinston\|Hinston]] to take over the Ladrians‚Äô house, but owing to an unfortunate disease that resulted in his death, Edwarn had to resort to Wax instead. He also confirmed that he was secretly transferring funds into the Set's bank account in preparation for his fake death and subsequent new life.
He managed to doom House Tekiel. By funding the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] in their robberies, the house owed payments on too many high-profile losses. These attacks, and the insurance claims, devastated them and their financial integrity. Company shareholders had been selling their stakes for pennies.
Edwarn and the [[Set\|Set]] wanted to breed Allomancers. He hired [[Miles\|Miles]] and the Vanishers to capture women with correct powers to do so. Both [[Steris\|Steris]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] were on his list, and when the former was captured, [[Wax\|Wax]] took it upon himself to find her.
Wax figured out he was alive and under the alias of ‚ÄúMr Suit‚Äù, Miles' employer. He also decoded Miles' notes which tracked his moves. He found his uncle, but had to let him go, as he had his sister captive.
Edwarn was later confirmed to be looking to start a rebellion in Elendel, creating chaos and profiting from it. Along with the Set he was developing higher technology that was still kept secret from the rest of the population; they were probably using it to create Allomancers, as there was not time for breeding.
Edwarn was also looking for a weapon in the south, so he trekked to the temple housing them. He tried to negotiate with Wax to help get them and almost managed to kill him by using his sister [[Telsin\|Telsin]] as a mole who shot him.
As Wax got the Bands' power and recovered, he confronted his uncle who was quick to arm a bomb in an airship and managed a duel. Eventually Wax beat Edwarn, leaving him tied to the top of the temple‚Äôs Lord Ruler‚Äôs spear.
Later, a [[Kandra\|Faceless Immortal]] with glowing red eyes visited him in prison and was impressed that he didn't give away any information. It then killed Edwarn and itself with an explosion just after stating: ‚ÄúYou will be allowed to serve in another Realm.‚Äù

## Relationships
### Wax
As Wax's uncle, Edwarn understands his nephew very much to the point of nearly predicting his every movements. He had overseen Wax¬¥s education, grooming him specifically as heir to the house.
Because Hinston dies, he searches for Wax to take over his fortune and estate after his death, hoping he has overcome his sense of morality.
This is not the case, and though he resisted killing him in the beginning he later asked his butler [[Tillaume\|Tillaume]] kill Wax. He survives and understood that for someone who had been loyal to the family for so long, the only reason he could be so eager to kill him was that he was following his former master. This is how Wax finds out his uncle is still alive.

### Telsin
Edwarn is [[Telsin\|Telsin's]] uncle, and they both faked their death in the same carriage accident. She is a member of the Set and had him join. She outranks him, and can give him orders.

## Trivia
In the Mistborn books, [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon]] likes to give characters nicknames along the lines of what might happen in a thieving crew; Edwarn's moniker "Mr. Suit" is an example of this.
