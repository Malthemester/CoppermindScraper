**Jez's Duty** is a winehouse in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is located in the Ten Rings section of the [[Breakaway\|Breakaway]] marketplace.
The interior of Jez's Duty is decorated as a [[Stormshelter\|stormshelter]], with [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] [[Stormclock\|clocks]] on the wall showing when a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] is happening in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. The winehouse holds a daily vigil for Alethkar and occasionally hosts an [[Ardent\|ardent]], who comes to burn [[Glyphward\|glyphwards]]. [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] frequents Jez's Duty and has a reserved booth at the back; this is a point of pride for the establishment, especially since the atmosphere tends to be more raucous and closer to that of a tavern than to a typical winehouse. When [[Shallan\|Shallan]] visits, she tends to carve the table with different bits of art. The winehouse is typically patronized by [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] and, especially, soldiers. Some of the employees at the winehouse include [[Marni\|Marni]], [[Jor\|Jor]], [[Mel\|Mel]], and [[Hem\|Hem]].

## History
Adolin began to frequent Jez's Duty around eight months before the evacuation of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. He made [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] go with him from time to time, including the day when Jor and [[Kryst\|Kryst]] held their wedding party there. After the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] army left for the offensive in [[Emul\|Emul]], the activity level noticeably dropped in the winehouse. Kaladin and [[Teft\|Teft]] chose it as the place to meet [[Rlain\|Rlain]] when they were searching for [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]]. During that meeting, [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] managed to turn the tower's defense mechanisms back on the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], causing Teft to fall unconscious.
After the occupation of the tower was overthrown, Jez's Duty was the location of a party in honor of Teft after his funeral. Aside from the party, Kaladin arranged a meeting with [[Noril\|Noril]], Dabbid, and the other members of his talk therapy group that day at the winehouse, in order to decompress from the stressful events of Urithiru's occupation.
