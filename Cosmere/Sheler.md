## Appearance and Personality
He is a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] of the fifth [[Dahn\|dahn]]. He is very arrogant and self-righteous, even as a prisoner.

## History
In 1168, Sheler commanded a company fighting for [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]] in Amaram's army during a battle with [[Hallaw\|Hallaw's]] forces. A group of his soldiers became outnumbered while defending a hilltop and were suffering heavy casualties, but Sheler ordered them to stand their ground. One of his squadleaders, [[Varth\|Varth]], sacrificed several messenger boys as a distraction, including [[Tien\|Tien]]. Sheler was presumably acting on orders from Amaram, who wanted Hallaw's forces to bunch up so that he could ride in with his cavalry and rout them; he placed his own glory above the lives of his men.

\-Sheler, demanding the right of ransom from Dieno[1]

Sheler later moved to the border to fight the [[Herdaz\|Herdazians]], and he learned their language over time. Using the invasion of his homeland by [[Singer\|singers]] as an excuse, he robbed and murdered Herdazian civilians and abused their women. When he was taken captive by the Herdazian general [[Dieno enne Calah\|Dieno enne Calah]], he demanded the "right of ransom", but Dieno told him that he had forfeited that right by committing war crimes. Instead, Sheler was given three options for punishment: beheading by the women that he abused, being tortured with a hammer and hung from a cliff with no protection from the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], or wrestling "the hog". He chose to fight the hog, assuming it was a pig, and began to formulate plans to seek vengeance on the Herdazians for humiliating him. He was doused in a foul-smelling oil and left shackled on the beach as the Herdazians used a horn to summon the hog, which was actually a huge sea creature with enormous claws. Sheler saw the creature break the surface of the ocean while the Herdazians placed wagers on how long he would survive; his ultimate fate is unknown.

## Trivia
Sheler's company uses a black [[Glyph\|glyphpair]] with shesh and lerel.
Sheler states that he is cousin to the highlord, presumably referring to Meridas Amaram.
The description of the hog is similar to that of large [[Greatshell\|greatshells]] such as the [[Yu-nerig\|yu-nerig]].
