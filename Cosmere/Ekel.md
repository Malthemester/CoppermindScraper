**Ekel** is one of [[House Davar\|House Davar's]] guards at their estate in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Ekel and another guard named [[Jix\|Jix]] were present when [[Mill\|Mill]] attempted to collect on [[Jushu Davar\|Jushu Davar's]] gambling debts from his father [[Lin\|Lin]]. Ekel and Jix were armed, but they did not have to fight since Lin declined to pay the massive debt and told Mill that he could take Jushu. After Mill departed, Ekel likely returned to his post on the manor grounds.
Ekel was presumably one of the Davar household guards that were replaced after the [[Ghostblood\|Ghostbloods]] took interest in Lin and [[Luesh\|Luesh]] became his steward.
