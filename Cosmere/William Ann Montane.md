**William Ann Montane** is the fourteen year-old daughter of [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]], who lives with and helps her mother in the running of a [[Silence's waystop\|waystop]] in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]].

 by  Marie Seeberger  In the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests]] with her mother
William Ann takes after her father in appearance, and is already taller than her mother by fourteen. She often complains of awkwardness or being too tall, but Silence thinks that these attributes imply that William Ann will be beautiful.
She helps her mother to kill [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]] and his men for their bounty, and to recover the body from [[Red Young\|Red Young]], who later cuts them off at the [[Old Bridge\|Old Bridge]] and takes her hostage. She is pushed through a [[Shade\|Shade]] by Red after he draws her blood.
Silence rushes her to the waystop and saves her life -- stopping her from being turned into a Shade -- by pouring a mixture of powdered silver and water down her throat and on her face. However, her left side is blackened in the process, leaving her hand and some of her toes in need of amputation.
