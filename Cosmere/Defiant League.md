The **Defiant League** is the collection of cavern city-states which make up the human population of [[Detritus\|Detritus]], the survivors of the [[Defiant (starship)\|Defiant]] fleet. They named themselves Defiants after the flagship of their old fleet. Not all humans that live on Detritus are part of the Defiant League, with some of the old clans continuing to rove the planet as nomads.
The Defiant League consists of a number of caverns including [[Igneous Cavern\|Igneous Cavern]], [[Vici Cavern\|Vici Cavern]], [[Bountiful Cavern\|Bountiful Cavern]], and the [[Deep caverns\|Deep caverns]]. The cave network is known as the United Defiant Caverns.
Workers wear jumpsuits, with different colors denoting the profession.
Prior to the [[Battle of Alta\|Battle of Alta]], the humans lived in small clans that populated different parts of the planet as larger groups could be detected by the Krell. Each clan was made up of individuals that could trace their lineage back to a specific ship or crew from the *Defiant's* fleet. After finding Igneous, some of these clans began to create [[Starfighter\|starfighters]] and [[Alta Base\|Alta Base]] was constructed. The defeat of the [[Varvax\|Krell]] at the Battle of Alta allowed for the many groups of humans on Detritus to join together forming the Defiant League.
