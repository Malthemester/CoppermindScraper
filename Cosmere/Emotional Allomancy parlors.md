## Soothing Parlors
Soothing parlors are staffed by [[Brass\|brass]] [[Misting\|Mistings]]. The Soothers can dampen negative emotions such as fear and anger, allowing the patron temporary relief from their problems while they feel numb. They offer a wide variety of services, including aromatherapy and massages. They stay open late into the night, serving as a slightly more expensive alternative to drinking at a tavern.
Typically, one or more Soothers use their abilities in a small bubble to create a general numbing effect on the people in most of the parlor building, but patrons can pay a high fee to get a private session that can help them address specific emotions. Parlors often have many rooms that each offer a unique atmosphere, likely to enhance the effects of the Soothing.

## Rioting Parlors
Rioting parlors are presumably similar in most respects to Soothing parlors, but are instead staffed by [[Zinc\|zinc]] Mistings. Customers can select specific emotions that they want the Rioters to enflame. Rioting parlors may be even more popular than Soothing parlors.

## Legality
Although the use of emotional Allomancy in business dealings was largely banned by the [[Allomantic Agreement of '94\|Allomantic Agreement of '94]], there is a specific exception in place if a customer willingly requests its use. The parlors are therefore fully legal, but a high potential for unscrupulous activity remains. The Elendel constabulary keeps a close watch on the city's parlors.
Soothing (and presumably Rioting) parlors are required to have [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] plating in the walls to prevent the effects of the Allomancy inside the building from affecting people outside. However, this rule is not strictly enforced. The proprietors also wear aluminum-lined hats so that they are immune to emotional Allomancy.

## History
It is not clear when Soothing and Rioting parlors came into common use; an article in *The Elendel Daily* in 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]] detailing the activities at Mistress [[Halex\|Halex's]] new Soothing parlor implied that many residents were not closely familiar with them at the time. However, by 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], there were multiple parlors of each type in the city, and they seemed to be accessible to any resident who wanted to use one.
Parlors became particularly popular during the time of high unemployment and social unrest in Elendel leading up to the ousting of the corrupt [[Replar Innate\|Governor Innate]]. [[Chapaou\|Chapaou]] went to Mistress Halex's Soothing parlor for a private session after being traumatized by seeing [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]]; Wax visited the parlor during his investigation and hated the feeling that it gave him.

## Trivia
Businesses like Soothing and Rioting parlors became possible because Allomancers were willing to hire out their services; [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] rarely did so, presumably because of a traditional reverence for their abilities.
