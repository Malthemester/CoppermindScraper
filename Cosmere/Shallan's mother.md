**Shallan's mother** is a [[Veden\|Veden]] [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and a member of [[House Davar\|House Davar]].

## Appearance and Personality
She has stark red hair and green eyes. She wore a blue and gold dress.
Shallan believes that her mother was brave. For unknown reasons, she was willing to kill her own daughter because of her [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities.

## History
 by  zoethatcher art  With her husband and five children
She was the first wife of [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]], and birthed [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran]], [[Balat Davar\|Balat]], twins [[Jushu Davar\|Jushu]] and [[Wikim Davar\|Wikim]], and [[Shallan\|Shallan]].
After Shallan began manifesting [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities at the age of eleven, her mother and an associate attempted to kill Shallan. They arrived at the Davar estate and argued with Lin, and Shallan's mother referred to her as "one of them". Lin and the associate scuffled; Lin injured the man with a knife that Shallan's mother then grabbed as the two men grappled. She attacked Shallan, but Shallan's bonded [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]], [[Testament\|Testament]], manifested as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] that Shallan used in self-defense to kill her mother.
Lin, who had witnessed what happened, locked the Blade in a box and Shallan later abandoned her spren. Lin spread rumors that he had killed his wife and her lover in a jealous rage. Keeping the secret of these events in order to protect Shallan presumably contributed to Lin's dangerous instability and the eventual fall of House Davar. The Davar children also developed mental health issues related to their mother's death and their father's subsequent rage, including Balat's fascination with death and Jushu's gambling addiction. In particular, Shallan's mental health was strongly affected by the guilt of killing her mother, leading to the suppression of many of her childhood memories. When she met [[Hoid\|Hoid]] at the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] in 1170, she allowed herself to briefly picture her life if her mother had still been alive, remembering her mother's voice and believing that she would have taught her philosophy and drawing.
