**Dereth** is the founder of the [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] religion. Though his [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] name is more well-known in modern times, his original [[JinDo\|JinDo]] name is **DeHwo**.
Dereth lived in [[JinDo\|JinDo]] anciently and studied as a disciple of [[Keseg\|Keseg]] along with [[Korath\|Korath]]. Keseg taught Dereth and his other disciples about unity, founding the Shu-Keseg religion. When Dereth and Korath left JinDo to teach in the lands to the north, they interpreted his teachings differently, which led to the foundation of [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]]. Dereth took Keseg's teachings about unity to mean that people should be united through obedience.
He presumably wrote the *Do-Dereth*, one of the holy books of Shu-Dereth, although over the years its text has been altered at least to include references to [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]].
