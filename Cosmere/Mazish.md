## History
During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Mazish served as a parshwoman in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] along with her mate, [[Dul\|Dul]]. Their master was harsh, and rejected Dul's request for the pair to be married in the human tradition. After the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], Mazish and Dul's minds were awakened and they joined (or were conscripted into) [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. However, they soon became some of the first singers recruited by Venli to join her resistance movement. The couple were able to get married after they were freed.
Mazish became a friend of Venli's and one of the most trusted members of her inner circle. She was able to gain a position serving [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. She and Dul advised new recruits on how to act around the [[Fused\|Fused]]. She was present when [[Shumin\|Shumin]] became Leshwi's assistant stormsetter, and subsequently attended a meeting with her in Venli's quarters.
Mazish and Dul were presumably part of Venli's team that left Kholinar for [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] before the singers invaded the tower. In Urithiru, Mazish was the first to inform Venli that [[Rlain\|Rlain]] had been captured. She later helped watch over the fallen [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] after [[Raboniel\|Raboniel's]] partial corruption of the tower's defenses. She also worked on hoarding supplies in anticipation of fleeing the Fused.
Mazish was among the team of fifteen singers that Venli planned to covertly evacuate to Kholinar before fleeing to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Venli trusted Mazish with a writ of authority from Raboniel that would allow passage through the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]]. Mazish was also the first member of the group to voice support for helping [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and his family escape, citing Kaladin's friendship with Rlain as a reason to trust him. After Leshwi's rebellion and the liberation of the tower, Mazish presumably went to the Shattered Plains via [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] with the rest of Venli's objectors, seeking to join the other [[Listener\|listeners]].
