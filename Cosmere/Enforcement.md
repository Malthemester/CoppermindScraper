**Enforcement** is an authoritarian police force used by [[Steelheart (Epic)\|Steelheart]] to rule [[Newcago\|Newcago]]. Enforcement is known to be commanded by the Epic [[Conflux\|Conflux]], but it is later revealed that he only acted as a battery, without any real power over its members.
They use energy weapons, Copters, and occasionally huge robotic armor suits. These have two rotary barrels, one on each arm.
Enforcement is composed of roughly 50 small groups, called Cores, which typically has five members - three infantry, one specialist (sniper, medic, etc) and one minor epic.
Known enforcement members include [[David\|David's]] friend, [[Roy\|Roy]], and an Epic, [[Refractionary\|Refractionary]], who was killed while [[David\|David]] was retrieving his notebooks.
After [[Steelheart\|Steelheart]] died and all the [[Epic\|Epics]] fled, The [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] starting accepting the allegiance of most of Enforcement to them to help them control [[Newcago\|Newcago]]. They now keep peace in [[Newcago\|Newcago]].
