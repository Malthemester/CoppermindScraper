## Geography
 by User: Otto didact A map of the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]]
### Climate
The weather of the Reshi Isles is warm and overwhelmingly humid. The rainfall on the Reshi Sea often forms a misting haze.

### Lifeforms
[[I-nah\|I-nah]] - A type of tree with bark of stone which grows along the bottom of the Reshi Sea.
[[Tai-na\|Tai-na]] - A type of island-sized habitable [[Greatshell\|greatshell]] worshiped by the Reshi.
## People
The Reshi are described as having black hair, tan skin and rounded features. They speak Reshi, which is a language sounding like barking. They are a relaxed people, living a simple life, though not every Reshi is carefree and prefers lounging to fighting.
They know much of foreigners, but are not aware of the current economic situation on the mainland, so they only trade with people they trust and respect during the trading season. With outsiders seeking out the place and trying to exploit them, they grow tired of those who bring goods of low quality. Despite this, they are capable of sending messages to distant locations, as [[Talik\|Talik]] was able to tell [[Vstim\|Vstim]] in advance that he should bring goods to trade for a larkin corpse.
The relatively relaxed culture of the Reshi Isles attracts foreigners to the isles as permanent residents. According to [[Vstim\|Vstim]], relocating to the Tai-na called Relu-Na requires giving all you own to their king. It is unclear if this is standard practice for all of the Reshi Isles, or just for this one.
As indigenous populations, the Reshi have no real concept of assassination and war. To them, battle is more about yelling and posturing than actual killing. When trading, a Reshi judges the other trader as they would judge a rival in battle.

## Culture
### Religion
The Reshi worship Tai-na as their gods. They believe that the Tai-na approve of boldness, and interpret the movements of the Tai-na as divine will. They use bundles of fruit as offerings. They appear to observe taboos of some sort regarding discussion of the spren that inhabit Tai-na, as [[Axies\|Axies]] the Collector warns [[Rysn\|Rysn]] not to "ask about the soul of their god."

### Clothing
Reshi standard clothing includes wrap and tassels. Swimmers like to walk about unclothed. In parts of the Reshi Isles, some women don't even wear tops due to the hot weather. The king of an island is dressed in full, voluminous robes and the soldiers wear crustacean breastplates and armguards carved with points.

### Furniture
All the Reshi furniture is flat and long. There are no chairs, just cushions.
