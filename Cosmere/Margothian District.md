The **Margothian District** was a former district in an unknown octant in [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. It was presumably residential. During the case of the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]], the Margothian district no longer existed, instead being absorbed into the industrial quarter of its octants. Then, its residents moved away.
[[Wayne\|Wayne]], when wanting to look at the [[Breaknaught\|Breaknaught]], pretended to be an old woman named Abrigain, and mixed an accent from the Margothian District.
