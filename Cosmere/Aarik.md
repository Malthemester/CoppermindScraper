## Personality and Appearance
>“*Ais: If it was the Sand Lord's will, I would've been there.*
\-Aarik: I... just cannot argue with that logic. It's mind-blowing.


Aarik is generally sarcastic, but hints at a more sincere layer beneath his smile. He shows little concern and even jokes lightly during serious and dangerous situations. He shows little respect, especially for authority, but he defends [[Ais\|Ais]]--a [[Trackt\|trackt]]--when her life is threatened. His sense of humour is rather acerbic, and he is shown to be rather gloomy when on his own. After Aarik picks up a sword again his personality drastically changes and he becomes cold, formal and distant. This gets even worse after he becomes Lord General.
Aarik has brown hair cut short on the right side and dropping to shoulder length on his left. He tends to wear a cape along with utilitarian clothing, including a number of leather pouches at his belt. During the events of *White Sand*, he has tanned skin, likely stemming from his exposure to UV light on the [[Darkside\|Darkside]]. The sword he uses was given to him as a gift from Kenton, and is supposedly rather valuable.

## Attributes and Abilities
Aarik is quick on his feet, proving himself able to evade an armed enemy in very close quarters without needing to make use of his own weapon. He is, however, a skilled swordsman  and [[Tonk\|tonk]] rider.

## History
He became friends with Kenton at a young age, giving him a basic understanding of the [[Sand mastery\|sand masters]]. His father--Lord [[Raagent\|Raagent]]--disowned Aarik for unknown reasons. Approximately three years ago, Aarik traveled to [[Darkside\|Darkside]] in hopes of becoming a successful merchant. He has returned to Lossand after little apparent success.

>“*Ah yes-- How could he have been so stupid as to live? Horrible mistake.*”
\-Aarik, referring to Drile.[2]

Aarik believed Kenton to be dead for two weeks before hearing that his friend had survived. Aarik arrived at the [[Diem\|Diem]] shortly after Kenton is named acting Lord Mastrell. The two are reunited and spend some time catching up. Aarik spent the night in Kenton's apartments. When [[Drile\|Drile]] arrived in the morning, Aarik seemed skeptical of Kenton's suspicion that Drile was behind the Kerztian attack on the Diem.
Aarik went with Kenton to many of the Taisha when Kenton was petitioning for their favor, trying to sway their votes to keep the Diem alive. This included Raagent, the Lord General. During the events of the hunt, when Aarik rescued his father from the karak, the two appeared to have mended their relationship somewhat, and are seen on friendly terms when Kenton is leaving. After another assassination attempt and a search for the Diem's missing funds, he realized how dire the situation is and considered leaving Kenton to his fate. Ultimately, he chose to stay on the account of their friendship and Kenton's cause being just.
During yet another assassination attempt on Kenton, Aarik was forced to choose between letting Kenton die or picking up a weapon and actively fighting to defend him. After a brief internal struggle, Aarik chose to fight to defend Kenton, killing six Kerztian assassins. After the fight, Aarik's personality seemed to change radically; he goes from jovial and outgoing to cold and formal. Kenton says that he is acting the way he used to act before he ran away to Darkside.
After Kenton discovers the body of Raagent, the Lord General, he asked Aarik to take the title of Lord General to insure his vote in maintaining the Diem; Aarik does so reluctantly but became even colder and more withdrawn causing Kenton to fear he had caused Aarik permanent mental harm.
When the Taishin voted on whether to maintain the Diem, Aarik voted in favor but remained distant.

## Quotes
>“*Khriss: Your father? who are you?*
\-Aarik: Someone of no import, and determined to stay that way.
