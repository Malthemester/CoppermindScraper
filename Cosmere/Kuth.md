**Kuth** is a nation-state on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. Like [[Huth\|Huth]], Kuth lies beyond the mountains of [[Idris\|Idris]].
Along with [[Huth\|Huth]], Kuth was the main rival to [[Vasher\|Vasher's]] [[Hanald\|Hanald]] in the [[Manywar\|Manywar]], and eventually fell by the conflict's end. It is unclear if Kuth and Huth were part of the [[Pahn Unity\|Pahn Unity]].
Three hundred years after the Manywar, a tyrant is trying to restore both Huth and Kuth, with [[Yesteel\|Yesteel's]] help.
