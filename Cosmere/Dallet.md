**Dallet** acts as [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] second-in-command during his time as squadleader in [[Amaram\|Brightlord Amaram's]] army.
When fighting in a minor border dispute against the [[Veden\|Vedens]], Dallet is suddenly killed by [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]], who had been given a Blade and Plate by the [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]] and was there for an unknown reason. Guilt over Dallet's death lingered with Kaladin until he spoke the Fourth Ideal, accepting that he couldn't save everyone.

## Appearance and Personality
Dallet has a full black beard that is cut short and speckled with gray, and his black eyes mark him as a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]]. Dallet is described as weathered and mountainous, with a gruff voice. He is confident in himself and Kaladin's ability to lead, and he seems to know Kaladin quite well. [[Teft\|Teft]] reminds Kaladin of Dallet, as he used to say that one of his tasks as sergeant was to keep his squadleader alive.

## History
Prior to the battle in which [[Amaram\|Amaram]] was attacked by Helaran Davar, a full [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]], Dallet helped Kaladin with scanning the battleground and gave [[Cenn\|Cenn]], a young recruit whom he found even before Kaladin could tell Dallet that he was going to arrive soon, some veteran advice--like to piss before a fight. During this fight he also explained certain aspects of the battle to Cenn and kept steering him in formation until the boy lost the squad. When the whole squad was united again, Dallet returned to Kaladin the knives he'd retrieved and the two decide to take down a [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] enemy battalionlord. While Kaladin was fighting the officer Dallet stayed behind with the wounded, but when Kaladin looked back he saw Dallet getting cut through the head with a Shardblade and collapsing.
