The **First Citizen**s of the [[Defiant League\|Defiant League]] are the forty pilots who participate in the [[Battle of Alta\|Battle of Alta]], as well as their families and descendants. They are given special privileges, including special quarters and influence, and their children are given a free entrance into Flight School and do not have to take the entrance exam.
It is likely that many, if not all, of the First Citizen's live in the [[Deep Caverns\|Deep Caverns]], as is the case with Jorgen Weight and his family. Many of those that survived the battle go on to hold high ranking positions either in the DDF or the National Assembly.
The First Citizen's are revered by the people of the Defiant League, with a large statue of the group being placed in Igneous Cavern.
Chaser's family, however, are not considered First Citizen's due to his actions during the battle. Instead, Chaser was branded a coward and his family shunned. Spensa's mother, was offered special housing and privileges in exchange for accepting and endorsing the DDF's story of Chaser's actions, however it is unclear if the family was being offered First Citizen status or just higher merit.
