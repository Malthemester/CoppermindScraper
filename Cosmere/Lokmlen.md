**Lokmlen** is a [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] criminal working for [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]] in [[Kezare\|Kezare]] on the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is brown-skinned, bald, and has a Kerztian cross scar on his forehead and over his eyes. He wears a goatee and a hoop earring in his left ear. He carries a [[Zinkall\|zinkall]] and a sword. He is a devout and vocal Kerztian and belongs to the warrior-priest [[DaiKeen\|DaiKeen]].

## History
Lokmlen was chased by [[Ais\|Ais]] through the portside market of Kezare after escaping the scene of a [[Trackt\|Trackt]] raid where he killed three trackts. When Ais catches him she demands to know where [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]] is and who they are working for. During the fight he taunts her calling her names and accusing her of being a traitor to her people. In the end Lokmlen overpowers her and is about to kill her, when [[Aarik\|Aarik]] interrupts and challenges Lokmlen. Aarik then outmatches him before stomping on his foot, giving Ais an opening to put her zinkall to his head and arrest him. Later, at the scene of the raid, the trackts find [[Torkel\|Torkel]] trapped behind a cupboard, who had gone missing a year before in a presumed boating accident. During his stay in prison [[Tain\|Tain]] tells Ais that Lokmlen has given in, and is talking and giving the trackts information. It is unclear if this was actually true, or if Tain, i.e. Sharezan, was simply feeding Ais bad information in Lokmlen's name. At some point he is freed him from his imprisonment, presumably by Tain, and rejoins the gang. At Sharezan's orders, he plants a firebomb in the orphanage Ais grew up in, and then goes to the location of Sharezan's trap for Ais.
