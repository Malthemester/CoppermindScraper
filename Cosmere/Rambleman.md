**Rambleman** is the name given to some traveling merchants and peddlers on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. They are more than simple traveling jugglers or storytellers, as they specialize in bringing news (for a price) and stories alongside their goods and services.
[[Sisirinah\|Siri]] seems to have frequently listened to stories from ramblemen in her youth. She had various notions of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] that were affected by these tales; she thought of it as a tropical, colorful land, but also a place of death with walls built of skulls painted in obscene splotches of color. She also heard tales of other grandiose cities and interesting terrain in distant countries such as [[Xaka\|Xaka]] and [[Hudres\|Hudres]], although Hallandren was the only locale that was said to have a verdant jungle. The stories told by the ramblemen make her appreciate her small-town life in [[Idris\|Idris]]. After arriving in Hallandren, Siri realized that the stories of the ramblemen were heavily embellished.

## Trivia
Brandon cites "rambleman" as an example of an intriguing term in his novels that is not explicitly explored in the text, allowing the reader to do their own mental worldbuilding.
