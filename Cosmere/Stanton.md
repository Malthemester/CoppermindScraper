**Lord Stanton** is the lord of a noble house in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
Soon after High Lord [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] return to [[Elendel\|Elendel]] from the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], he attended an event hosted by Lord Stanton. Rather than spend time with the other nobles, Wax chose to leave the party and explore the [[Mist\|mists]], leaping and moving about with his [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]]. This was an insult to Lord Stanton and his hospitality, so Wax later sent him a letter apologizing for his misconduct. This event and others, including a similar incident at a party hosted by Lady [[Aving Cett\|Aving Cett]], led to Wax developing a reputation for wild behavior and boorishness.

## Trivia
There is a street in Elendel named Stanton Way, presumably after House Stanton.
