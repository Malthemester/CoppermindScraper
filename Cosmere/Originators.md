The **Originators** is the colloquial name given to the survivors of the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. They either hid in [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] storage caches or other underground caverns to survive the end of the old world.
Almost a fifth of the Originators were [[Terris\|Terris]].
During [[Sazed\|Sazed's]] ascension, he undid a lot of the changes that the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] made to the genetics of the various peoples of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. The survivors presumably had their bodies rewritten on the fly to remove differences between nobles, skaa, and the Terris peoples. This consigned these differences to the historical record.
[[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] considered the originators to be "big-city people".
