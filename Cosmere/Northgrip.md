## History
[[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]] ordered his sister [[Shallan\|Shallan]] some expensive drawing supplies from a merchant in Northgrip that were later delivered to the Davar estate.
After arriving on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], Shallan attempted to send messages to her family, including a letter sent through Northgrip. Northgrip was far away from the battles in the [[Veden civil war\|Veden civil war]], and Shallan hoped that its remote location would improve the chances that a letter would get through the chaos to her family.
