## Appearance and Personality
>“*Why, the fact that you don't know this is a clear indication that you are a scribe. Your writing is pretty, Brightness. But you must give more heed to science.*”
\-Elthebar, to Teshav[2]


He is tall and has a long, pointed beard. He wears the esoteric robes common among stormwardens. He is pompous, and holds some prejudice against female scholars. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] considers him to be a mean person who hides his true nature from [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Elthebar's primary skill is predicting [[Highstorm\|highstorms]], largely based on data regarding previous highstorms. He also forecasts the changing of seasons. He uses [[Glyph\|glyphs]] extensively in his work.
He also utilizes pseudoscience. His team includes astrology as part of their forecasting methods, and he questions the work of [[Navani\|Navani's]] scholars because of his belief in "digitology" (judging men by the width of their fingers).

## History
### The War of Reckoning
During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Elthebar was a high ranking stormwarden for [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] in their warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Dalinar questioned the advice of stormwardens, as he did not like the fact that forecasting [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] was an inexact science; Dalinar also felt that the will of the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] could not be predicted. Dalinar was also uncomfortable with the fact that stormwardens used many [[Glyph\|glyphs]], based on Vorin doctrine that men should eschew reading. Although Elthebar's predictions were often filled with caveats, Dalinar eventually accepted the fact that stormwardens were right more often than they were wrong, and he could not ignore the strategic advantages of predicting highstorms.
In Kak 1173, Dalinar and [[Renarin\|Renarin]] were forced to take shelter in a barrack when a highstorm that Elthebar had not forecasted hit while they were riding from a meeting with King [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] at the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]].

### The True Desolation
Elthebar relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with most of the Alethi after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. In the tower, he was considered head of the stormwardens. He and his team continued their forecasting work, including a prediction of the storm in which [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] took [[Venli\|Venli]] into the visions with [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]]. As the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] improved their infrastructure in the tower, Navani implemented more scientifically rigorous atmospheric studies, led by [[Benneh\|Benneh]]. Elthebar and Benneh did not collaborate.
Elthebar was present during the first meeting of the scholars in Urithiru alongside [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], Navani, [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Renarin\|Renarin]], and many others. He interrupted a report by [[Kalami\|Kalami]] and insulted [[Teshav\|Teshav's]] intelligence for questioning him, earning Shallan's ire. He was also one of the people who strategized with Navani immediately after [[Raboniel\|Raboniel's]] incursion into the tower, although Navani did not particularly want him to be there.
Elthebar was present at the battlefront in [[Emul\|Emul]] and informed Dalinar of the time of an upcoming highstorm.
