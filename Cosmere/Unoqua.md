**Scion Unoqua** is the religious leader of [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn's]] court in [[Azir\|Azir]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is old and has a full paunch. He has a deep reverence for [[Yaezir\|Yaezir]] and the religious customs of Azir.

## History
Unoqua was one of the highest-ranking scions in Azir, possibly the highest. He was referred to as Azir's "religious leader" and was part of Yanagawn's inner circle of advisors, alongside senior [[Vizier\|viziers]] such as [[Noura\|Noura]], [[Axikk\|Axikk]], and [[Dalksi\|Dalksi]]. Although he was not mentioned by name, it is likely that Unoqua was the older scion who turned [[Nale\|Nale]] away after [[Gawx\|Gawx]] was elevated to [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] and pardoned [[Lift\|Lift]]. Lift later referred to an important scion in the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] that she nicknamed "Daddy Sag-butt"; this also presumably referred to Unoqua.
Unoqua was aboard the ship evacuating Yanagawn from [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. Along with Noura and Dalksi, he attempted to counsel Yanagawn against turning back to Thaylen City based on [[Lift\|Lift's]] opinion. He held steadfastly to the notion that Yanagawn had been chosen as Prime by Yaezir and led by divine right, despite Yanagawn's dissent. Unoqua expressed fear and skepticism of the powers of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] and was concerned about the warnings of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]].
