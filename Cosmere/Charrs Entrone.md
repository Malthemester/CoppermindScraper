**Charrs Entrone** was a [[Noble\|noble]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].
He was infamous for his twisted sense of pleasure, enjoying things like [[Skaa\|skaa]] bloodfights. However, one night after a skaa fight, [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] murdered the drunk Charrs Entrone, and dumped the lord's corpse in [[Keep Tekiel\|Keep Tekiel's]] gardens. As [[House Entrone\|House Entrone]] was a major political ally of [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]], Kelsier hoped that Charrs's death would lead Tekiel to suspect their rival, [[House Izenry\|House Izenry]], but Charrs's gambling opponent had been [[Crews Geffenry\|Crews Geffenry]], who was a known Mistborn. Either Tekiel could blame Izenry, or [[House Geffenry\|House Geffenry]]--which had been petitioning for a stronger alliance with Tekiel. Kelsier did not care who was truly to blame, as he simply wanted the nobility to question and worry.
Later, [[Kliss\|Kliss]] suggested that Geffenry murdered Charrs Entrone as to make the Tekiels worry, and make them want additional allies. [[Rene\|Rene]], Kliss's date at that particular ball, thought this was unlikely. Still, Charrs' death lead to the killings of [[Ardous Geffenry\|Ardous]] and [[Callins Geffenry\|Callins Geffenry]] at Tekiel's hands.
