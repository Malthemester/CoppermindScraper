## Objectives
The Unseen Court is aligned with the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] sees their greatest impact as being spies. [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] puts much greater value on their ability to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] food.

## Structure
>“*Whatever you did, it’s behind you. We accept you, Vathah. The Unseen Court is a family.*”
\-Shallan to Vathah[3]


Shallan is the leader of the Unseen Court and is known as Master Lightweaver. Newly joined individuals are referred to as squires until they bond a spren. Once they bond a spren, they are known as Agent Lightweavers. [[Cryptic\|Cryptics]] are willing to bond humans quicker than other spren.
There are twenty members of the Unseen Court, with roughly an even split of men and women. Though members who have earned their own [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] could break off and develop their own group of squires, they choose to stay together. Shallan believes the court is complete.
The Unseen Court practices in a chamber deep under [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], as their training involves using Lightweaving to distract their opponents. They practice using swords, more as a way to improve their disguises, as combat is seen as a last resort. 

## History
### Pursuit of Sons of Honor
[[Red (Roshar)\|Red]] embedded himself in the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]] using the illusion of a dark-eyed woman. He was not considered important enough to warrant an audience with [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]]. Shallan disguised herself as [[Chanasha Hasareh\|Chanasha Hasareh]] in an attempt to get brought into the Sons of Honor, which succeeded. Shallan is brought to Ialai Sadeas's bed chamber, who immediately assumed she was an assassin from the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]]. Shallan (as Radiant) used a needle of [[Blackbane\|Blackbane]] to kill Ialai, though she blocked this from her memory to protect herself. She believed a second Ghostblood spy was amongst the Unseen Court. [[Vathah\|Vathah]], [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]], [[Stargyle\|Stargyle]], and [[Beryl\|Beryl]] were also on this mission.

### Mission to Shadesmar
The coalition of monarchs decided to send a group to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] to recruit [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] to their cause. Shallan was asked to recruit three Lightweavers to join the mission to Soulcast food and water. Shallan selected Ishnah, Vathah, and Stargyle, as they had shown the most interest and were most likely the Ghostblood's spy. At the last minute, Stargyle's wife became sick and [[Beryl\|Beryl]] was added as a replacement. Over the course of two weeks, the group sailed from [[Nohadon's Stairways\|Nohadon's Stairways]] to [[Nameless\|Nameless]]. While this happened, Shallan used a box containing the [[Seon\|seon]] [[Ala\|Ala]] to communicate to [[Mraize\|Mraize]]. She noticed that someone else was using the box and feared that one of the Court was using the box to communicate to Mraize.
Shallan devised a plan to catch the Ghostblood's spy. She fed misinformation to each member of her team about corrupted spren she'd seen. She told Beryl she'd seen corrupted [[Gloryspren\|gloryspren]], she told Ishnah she'd seen corrupted [[Windspren\|windspren]], and she told [[Vathah\|Vathah]] she'd seen corrupted [[Fearspren\|fearspren]]. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] leaked that he'd heard about corrupted gloryspren, which implicated Beryl. [[Pattern\|Pattern]] had in fact been the one to communicate using the box, but only to [[Wit\|Wit]]. It was a Ghostblood [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] posing as a writing instrument for Wit was the source of Mraize's information. Shallan was relieved to know she had not been betrayed by the Unseen Court.
Upon their arrival in Nameless, Shallan and Vathah posed as [[Cultivationspren\|cultivationspren]] in order to scout the area. Once they arrived in Lasting Integrity, Shallan entered the stronghold, while the rest of the Unseen Court camped outside. Shallan and [[Adolin\|Adolin]] completed their mission, having convinced the honorspren to join the war and open their fortress to outsiders.
