>“*I suggest, that the ratio of the gears used in the lift machinery might be indicative of the nature of those who built it. It is the science of digitology, you see. You can judge much about a man by the width of his fingers.*”
\-Elthebar[1]


**Digitology** is a method of judging people based on the width of their fingers on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. A [[Stormwarden\|stormwarden]] named [[Elthebar\|Elthebar]] suggested that the gear ratio of the [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] lifts of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] could somehow be related to the fingers of the people who crafted them.
