**Lua** is one of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds']] [[Aspect\|aspects]].
He is a Samoan survivalist who is described as a beefy man with a big smile. He weighs about three hundred pounds. In the [[White Room\|White Room]] he would start conversations with whoever was closest.
Lua builds a "stone age" house in his spare time, using only technology he could build by himself. When [[Jenny\|Jenny]] manifests and Stephen begins losing aspects, he is working on the hearth of the house. He also runs or helps run a Cub Scout troop.
While Stephen is chasing after [[Sandra\|Sandra]], Lua left the house to grab something from his survival hut, but he disappeared. He then showed up to help Stephen escape the survival-island simulation. Claiming that he had broken too many rules by teleporting and constructing a catamaran instantaneously, he vanishes without becoming a nightmare.
