## History
### The Vanishers
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] Uncle, [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]], is a member of the Set. He faked his death to enter the Set and operated under the alias Mister Suit. He provided funding for [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] and the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]]. The Vanishers were instructed to kidnap female descendants of the [[Spook\|Lord Mistborn]] in order to breed more [[Misting\|Mistings]] for some unknown purpose. The Vanishers did this through a series of elaborate, and seemingly supernatural, train robberies. Wax discovered that his uncle lived after the capture of Miles Dagouter. During Wax's encounter with his uncle, Wax stole Edwarn's pocketbook that contained appointments and notes.

### The Bands of Mourning
Wax was provided with information from the [[Kandra\|kandra]] that the Set was operating in the city of [[New Seran\|New Seran]], and that his sister [[Telsin\|Telsin]] was observed there. While Wax and company traveled to New Seran they were attacked in a Set train robbery. Professor [[Irich\|Irich]] was present. When they arrived in New Seran Wax and [[Steris\|Steris]] attended a ball at the home of a local noble Lady [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores]]. Wax learned about Set activities near [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]]. When he confronted Lady Shores she was communicating with Suit through a strange metal box. Lady Shores was killed by a servant and discovered to be wearing a [[Gold\|gold]] [[Metalmind\|metalmind]] that was not keyed to an individual. The goldmind had a large amount of health stored in it and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] was able to tap it.
The party then traveled to Dulsing, where a Set compound had been built around the entire town. They infiltrated the compound and discovered what appeared to be a large boat in the center. The boat was actually the *Brunstell*, a [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship. Wax was able to rescue Telsin. [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] discovered and rescued a Southern Scadrian named [[Allik\|Allik]] who had been held captive in the offices of Professor Irich. They escaped the compound in the *Wilg*, an outrigger from the main airship.
From there they attempted to get to the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]] to secure the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] before a Set expedition could. They arrived at the Temple first and the Set arrived shortly after. Suit used threats and was able to accompany Wax into the Temple. Wax and company were then betrayed by Telsin who was revealed to hold the Set rank of Sequence, a higher rank than Suit. Suit and Sequence were also revealed to have [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] Spikes, granting themselves three [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] abilities each.
The search for the Bands appeared to be lost. The Set was interested in the Bands of Mourning, but their primary objective was to secure the Hunter airship, and its bombs, that were abandoned at the temple. Upon first entering the Temple [[Wayne\|Wayne]] took the spear tip from a statue of the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]]. He had put the spear tip in Marasi's bag. She discovered that it was in fact the Bands of Mourning. She was able to rescue Wax, who then used the Bands to confront Suit on the departing airship. He apprehended Suit and recovered the airship. The Set members were imprisoned and the airship was returned to the surviving Southern Scadrians. Sequence escaped from the Temple in the *Wilg*.

### Accelerated Timeline
>“* The Set had been planning for events a century or more away.*”
\- Mister Suit[10]


The Set had evidently planned for its goals to be reached a century in the future. With the discovery of the Bands of Mourning, Southern Scadrians, and their technology, the timeline was accelerated. While held in an Elendel jail, Suit was visited by a mysterious creature with red eyes. He told Suit that the Set had decided that allowing civilization on Scadrial to continue was too dangerous and that they decided to "remove life on this sphere instead." The creature then activated an explosive device, killing Suit.
