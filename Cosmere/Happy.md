**Happy** is a very fat [[Taynix\|taynix]] that [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] discovers in a cavern along with several other taynix. He is one of the yellow and blue variety of taynix, allowing him to teleport with his cytonic abilities. When Jorgen, [[Freyja\|FM]], and [[Rodge McCaffery\|Rig]] are first watching over the new taynix, Happy and [[Chubs\|Chubs]] get into a crate of mushrooms and begin eating. FM discovers them in the crate, and gives Happy his name. Happy likes Rig especially, and often climbs into his lap.
Happy goes with [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] on their rescue mission to [[Sunreach (station)\|Sunreach]]. With Jorgen’s direction, Happy uses his cytonic abilities to teleport into [[Nedd\|Nedd]]’s starfighter and bring him into the station, saving him.
