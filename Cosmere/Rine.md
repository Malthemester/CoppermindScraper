## Appearance and Personality
Rine is one of the few [[Fused\|Fused]] who are still sane. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], he possesses the body of a tall [[Singer\|singer]]. As one of the *shanay-im*, he wears a long cloak and does not walk on the ground, preferring to [[Gravitation\|hover]] a few feet above it.
Certain [[Listener\|listener]] traditions seem to baffle him, such as their taboos regarding dead bodies and their reluctance to talk about [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]]. He is sometimes dismissive of [[Venli\|Venli]], although he more readily accepts her words when she speaks respectfully and uses the ancient tongue. Like other Fused, he speaks and hums to Odium's Rhythms, although he is one of the few to use the calmer Rhythm of Withdrawal.
Rine remembers the ancient Desolations and the shock among the Fused when they realized the existence and the strength of the [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] between [[Spren\|spren]] and humans. In Rine's opinion, it is more important to keep a close watch on human slaves than to exploit them as workers; he fears that [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] might arise among them.

## Attributes and Abilities
Rine is a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] that serves [[Odium\|Odium]]. Like all Fused, he is able to travel from [[Braize\|Braize]] to Roshar and possess the body of a singer during a [[Desolation\|Desolation]]. He is able to use [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] and manipulate the [[Surge\|Surge]] of [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]].
He seems to rank relatively highly among the Fused, likely due to his sanity. He led the team that traveled through [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] proselytizing singers, and typically conferred with a town's [[Spren\|spren]] right before they moved from one town to another.

## History
Rine guided Venli in her preachings to the newly awakened Alethi [[Parshmen\|parshmen]]. At first they visited small villages, but after this practice they moved on to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. Rine personally helped fly Venli to the new location. In Kholinar, the true labor began, with Venli giving many presentations each day. When Venli compared the newly awakened parshmen to babes, Rine compared her to a toddler.
After Rine and Venli had been in Kholinar for some time, they joined the fleet that was preparing for the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. Rine offered Venli the opportunity to refresh herself in the cabin of their ship, but Venli asked him why they needed such a large fleet when they had the Fused. Rine answered that the most skilled Fused had yet to awaken and even if they did, they would not fight alone. He became philosophical on the subject, and said that once the humans had been defeated, the Fused would hand over Roshar to the singers and finally get to rest.
