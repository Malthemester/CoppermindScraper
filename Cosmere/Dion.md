## Appearance and Personality
As an Elantrian during the period of the incomplete [[Shaod\|Shaod]], Dion suffered from blotchy skin and balding hair. However, he was a young man, and still managed to appear relatively stout.

## Attributes and Abilities
Dion is of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] descent and his name is based on Aon Dio. He has some knowledge of how to use a spear. It is not known if he survived to see the restoration of Elantris, but he would have gained the full powers of an Elantrian.

## History
At some point, likely after the [[Reod\|Reod]] due to his young age, Dion was taken by the incomplete [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. This caused negative effects to his body and he became one of the "incomplete" Elantrians living in the crumbling city. He was a member of Raoden's guard in New Elantris under Captain [[Saolin\|Saolin]], and he served as an armed sentry on the borders of the New Elantris settlement.
