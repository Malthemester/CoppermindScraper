**Nissiqqan** is a scribe in the city of [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]] in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is the deputy scribe of immigration on duty at [[Hauka\|Hauka's]] post on the day that [[Lift\|Lift]] arrives at the city.

## Appearance and Personality
He is an older man with a furrowed face and a cleft chin. He is seen wearing glasses and a yellow [[Shiqua\|shiqua]], and carries folders containing various forms and documents. He likes to be out in the sun. He is very knowledgeable regarding local taxes and ordinances, but is willing to overlook petty crimes if appropriate reparations are paid. He displays a measure of benevolence in his concern for refugees.
He has some infused [[Spheres\|spheres]], which are rare in the area at the time; Hauka plans to trade him some interesting information for the spheres so that she can read at night.

## History
He and Hauka reviewed an unusually well-dressed farmer's papers, and concluded that he was actually smuggling in grain that was raided in [[Emul\|Emul]]. Nissiqqan suggested a triple tariff, with the money going to help feed refugees.
Lift suddenly appeared; she brushed past him while evading Hauka, and he dropped his folders.
