**Avado** is a non-Alethi merchant on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Appearance and Personality
Nothing is known of Avado's appearance. He is a clever man and a skilled enough merchant to anticipate potential changes in the trade markets due to the assassination of the king. He is also a kind man, friendly enough to inquire after strangers standing by the side of the road.

## History
Shortly after King [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] assassination by [[Szeth\|Szeth]], Avado realized that the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] might mistreat foreigners. He decided to leave Alethkar for a friendlier trade environment in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. Avado noticed Szeth standing by the side of the road, having retrieved his Oathstone from where the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] had discarded it, and inquired about the [[Shin\|Shin]] man. Szeth was then forced to explain his nature as [[Truthless\|Truthless]] and give the Oathstone to Avado. The two traveled together to Jah Keved, Avado unaware that he was harboring the king's assassin.
