**Dor** is a [[Singer\|singer]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
In early 1175, they were part of the [[Fused\|Fused's]] forces stationed in [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] under the command of [[Abiajan\|Abiajan]]. They were one of the inspectors on duty when [[Lirin\|Lirin]] attempted to sneak the [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]] general [[Dieno enne Calah\|Dieno enne Calah]] into town by using the general as a litter carrier. Although Dor was slightly more vigilant than their colleagues, they failed to notice Dieno, partly due to a planned distraction by [[Toralin Roshone\|Toralin Roshone]]. Dieno's party was allowed to enter the town just before Abiajan ordered all of the inspectors to close off the city limits because [[Lezian\|Lezian]] had arrived seeking [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]].
