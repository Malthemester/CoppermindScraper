>“* The Right of Challenge is an ancient tradition—some say the Heralds instituted it.*”
\- Adolin[1]


The **Right of Challenge** is a [[Vorin\|Vorin]] tradition said to have been created by the [[Herald\|Heralds]]. It can be offered to any [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] warrior who has proven themselves -- usually himself -- before the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] and the king.
The Right of Challenge allows a person to demand justice through combat from someone who wronged them. Many lighteyes know of the tradition, but it is ignored in modern circumstances. The Right of Challenge, used in conjunction with the [[King's Boon\|King's Boon]], has been used twice in Alethkar's recent history: once by Prince [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] against Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], and once by Sadeas against Highprince [[Yenev\|Yenev]] eighteen years earlier. It was also used by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] against [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]], despite the former being a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]], though his attempt landed him in prison.

## History

>“*I will have no boon other than Yenev’s cowardly heart on the end of my sword, Your Majesty!*”
\-Sadeas [1]


Highprince Yenev was one of the main forces in opposition against [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] and the unification of Alethkar. To remove him Sadeas spoke with Gavilar regarding the Right of Challenge and the King’s Boon. Since they were traditions that shared a relationship to the historical crown, invoking them echoed the right of rule Gavilar and his camp were trying to establish. Using a tournament as part of their plan Sadeas dueled another [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]]. During the duel he paused the fighting at several points and raised the stakes, offering money and then lands. In the end, the victory was dramatic and King Gavilar stood and offered Sadeas the boon. Sadeas dueled Yenev and killed him, the lands going to their ally [[Aladar\|Aladar]]. 


>“*I demand the Right of Challenge. I demand the chance to duel Highprince Sadeas, right here and now, as redress for the crimes he committed against my house!*”
\-Adolin [2]


Adolin Kholin tried to used Sadeas's tactic against him, with the help of his causal betrothed [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]].  He challenged [[Relis Ruthar\|Relis Ruthar]] to a paired disadvantaged duel, accidentally leaving himself open to a full disadvantaged duel, wagering all the shards his house held against Relis's. He managed to win the duel with the help of Kaladin, [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]] and, unknowingly, Shallan and [[Pattern\|Pattern]]. [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] offered him the King's Boon for the feat and he challenged Sadeas to a duel. However Kaladin gave Sadeas time to flee, sending back a response later that he would duel Adolin in one year's time, when he interrupted to challenge Amaram.  Kaladin was placed in prison for slander at the behest of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] rather than executed as the law and the king demanded.
