## Physical description
The shape is similar to a Chinese scepter known as a  and it is pale blue in color, echoing the color of Sel's moon Oem. It has [[Aon\|Aons]] written or inscribed on one side of it.

## History
The origin of the Moon Scepter is unknown.
[[Shai\|Shai]] wanted to swap the real scepter with her own [[Forgery\|Forged]] copy as a test of her skill, because it was the most famous piece of art in the whole empire. After an elaborate plan that also included the theft and Forgery of a painting by [[Han ShuXen\|Han ShuXen]], she was betrayed at the last moment by [[Hoid\|Hoid]], who she knew as the Imperial Fool, and imprisoned. Shai assumed that the Fool escaped with the original scepter and that her Forged version now sat in the gallery. Hoid did take the original scepter but its fate after that point is unknown.

## Use in Investiture
The Moon Scepter is not simply ornamental; it is a translation device between sets of symbols that are used to access [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in the various Selish magic systems. This is significant because Sel's numerous manifestations of Investiture are similar to computer programming languages. A knowledgeable individual would therefore be able to use the translations to gain an understanding of the symbols that are integral to various types of Selish magic.
Selish magic is particularly powerful, but despite a common power source (the [[Dor\|Dor]]), each type of magic is usually only usable by people native to specific areas of Sel. Selish magic typically gets weaker as the distance from its homeland increases. This does vary by the specific magic system, but Selish magic generally does not work on other planets. This is a problem that some characters are actively trying to solve. Although the Moon Scepter does not remove these geographic restrictions, thus far it is the only known object that could make this task "less daunting".
The translation information on the scepter was the reason for Hoid's interest, and he has already gotten what he needs from it.

## Speculation
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

The scepter presumably has other symbols written or inscribed on it that correspond to the Aons known to be on one side. Brandon has not confirmed whether or not the scepter itself is Invested, but it is unlikely since it does not seem to have particular value to Hoid.
Brandon has confirmed that the scepter does not directly "unlock" or grant access to Selish magic. However, access to the Dor is heavily symbol-based. Someone that is able to use at least one type of Selish magic might be able to use the information on the scepter to gain access to one or more additional types of magic (including [[AonDor\|AonDor]], [[Forgery\|Forgery]], [[ChayShan\|ChayShan]], [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]], Invested potions, [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]], and more.) Alternatively, the translation could allow the powers of a magic system to be accessed using different symbols in non-native locations (for example, an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] traveling to [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] could be able to use AonDor with Dakhor glyphs rather than Aons).
The scepter is a piece of a much larger puzzle that could theoretically allow conversion between different types of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], even beyond those found on Sel.

## Trivia
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] sees a stick with unreadable writing on it in [[Mraize\|Mraize's]] "trophy room", but it is not the Moon Scepter.
