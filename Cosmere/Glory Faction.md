The **Glory Faction** is one of the eighty factions that governs the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].
They attempted to assassinate [[Ashravan\|Emperor Ashravan]], however only succeeded in killing his wife. Ashravan was left in a vegetative state, leading the [[Heritage Faction\|Heritage Faction]] to coerce the [[Forger\|Forger]] [[Wan ShaiLu\|Wan ShaiLu]] into Forging him a new soul. It is likely the Glory Faction felt they would be able to elevate one of their members to the position of emperor if Ashravan was killed.
During the mourning period for the Emperor's wife, which was the excuse given for Ashravan's seclusion; the Glory Faction spreads rumors that Ashravan was killed believing that the Heritage Faction was only stalling for time. When the [[Essence Mark\|Essence Mark]] created for Ashravan is successful, he is able to reveal himself to the Factions. This leads to a weakening of the Glory Factionâ€™s power since they had gambled on him not returning.
