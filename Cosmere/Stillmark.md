He is known as Stillmark the Noble, and his colors are blue and gold. He is described as a staunch traditionalist, opposing most proposals brought to the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]], and is in stark opposition to war with [[Idris\|Idris]].
He is influential in the court; most of the other gods consider him wise.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a [[Returned\|Returned]], Stillmark has a [[Divine Breath\|Divine Breath]] which gives him the benefits of being on the [[Fifth Heightening\|Fifth Heightening]]. This includes:

Aura Recognition - allows him to assess the number of Breaths a person possesses.
Perfect Pitch
Perfect Color Recognition - allows him to instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics.
Perfect Life Sense - allows him to sense people around him.
Agelessness - makes him immune to most toxins and physical ailments, as well as making him functionally immortal.
## Relationships
[[Nanrovah\|Nanrovah]] is his high priest. As such, Nanrovah shares his god's opposition to war with Idris and often expresses these opinions in the political assembly on Stillmark's behalf. When Nanrovah is targeted by [[Denth's crew\|Denth's crew]], who are currying support for a war against Idris, the few who still oppose war are successfully neutralized and Nanrovah seems to become a supporter for war. Given that Stillmark is opposed to war in the first place, and has a reputation for being difficult to sway, it is unlikely that he votes to attack Idris during the main assembly. This is further supported by the fact that, thanks to [[Vasher\|Vasher]], [[Denth\|Denth]] no longer has control over Nanrovah when the gods are finally assembled.
