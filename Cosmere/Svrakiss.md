### Shu-Dereth Faith
According to Shu-Dereth, the Svrakiss are the souls of men barred from entrance into heaven for hating Jaddeth in life, and so are condemned to wander Sel, bitterly cursing their fate and preying on the living. The Derethi believe that they had the ability to take over the bodies of living men and control their actions. When someone who follows Shu-Dereth has bad luck or a difficult time, they often believe that the Svrakiss are to blame. The Svrakiss are considered to be a representation of absolute evil.

## History
The Svrakiss were initally a [[Svorden\|Svordish]] concept that was adopted by the Derethi.
When [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] fell, the Derethi claimed that the [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] had really been Svrakiss all along, using their evil powers to perform magic to make the weak-minded worship them. This was not a belief shared by the [[Shu-Korath\|Korathi]] priests. [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] and [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] used this doctrine to attempt to turn the [[Arelene\|Arelene]] population against the Elantrians, although Hrathen did not genuinely believe that the Elantrians were Svrakiss.
