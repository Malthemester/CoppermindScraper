**Kenton Street** is a street in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Location
Kenton Street is in north-central Luthadel. It connects to a notable fountain square known as the [[Square of the Survivor\|Square of the Survivor]].

## History
Prior to the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], it housed shops for the [[Noble\|nobility]], including tailoring and jewelry shops. After the Collapse, [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] abolished the restrictions on [[Skaa\|skaa]] merchants and wages. As a result, Kenton Street became a lively market, with merchants employing criers and jugglers to try to attract attention for their wares.
During the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]], [[Tindwyl\|Tindwyl]] took [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]] and [[Vin\|Vin]] dress-shopping on Kenton Street. At the time, Vin noted that the merchants were charging as high as five [[Boxing\|boxings]] for a box of old apples. Later during the siege, Elend ordered [[Hammond\|Hammond]] to gather the Kenton Street clothing merchants and make them come see the skaa refugees, hoping that the poor conditions would convince the merchants to lower their prices.
