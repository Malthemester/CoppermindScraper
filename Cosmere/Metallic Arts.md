The **Metallic Arts** are the three prime manifestations of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. They consist of [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], and [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]. All three utilize certain metal alloys and each manifest specific abilities in the user (namely, metal is not the source of their power, but metal is their [[Focus\|focus]]). There are eight basic metals, each with an alloy, for a total of sixteen metals. In addition, there are *God Metals*, and alloys of them.

## Mechanics
The Metallic Arts can be analyzed in terms of the Scadrian [[Shard\|Shards]], [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. Allomancy is of Preservation and is End-Positive. Instead of Allomancy drawing power from the user, metal acts as a catalyst, and draws power from Preservation itself. [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] is of Ruin, and is End-Negative. By taking abilities from one person and giving them to another, in reduced amounts, power is actually lost. Finally, [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] is the power of balance, and is both of Ruin and Preservation. It is End-Neutral, as there is neither a gain or loss in energy, simply storing the power for later use.
It is possible to use molten metal for the metallic arts, but the Investiture would be affected. The Metallic Arts aren't influenced by how people think about them, unlike most other magic systems.
All people on Scadrial have seeds of the Metallic Arts within them. However, for most of the history of Scadrial, only Feruchemy was known, and that had always been isolated to the [[Terris\|Terris]] people. Allomancy existed but was very uncommon. It only came about through a mechanism constructed by Preservation, which [[Snap\|Snapped]] people who had Allomantic power too deep-seated to come out naturally. Hemalurgy was even more rare, as it required extensive knowledge not easily obtained.
Then, the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] reached the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. He rebuilt himself into an extremely powerful Mistborn using its power. He then took nine beads of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] from there, giving them to kings he wished to bribe to his side. This brought about the first Mistborn. The concentrated Preservation inside the lerasium was so potent, that Allomantic ability was passed down for over a millennia. Eventually, the power got diluted and Mistings began to form, and Mistborn became more uncommon. During his [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension]], the Lord Ruler also gained an understanding of Hemalurgy, and understood how to create [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitors]], [[Koloss\|koloss]], and [[Kandra\|kandra]].
Later, after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]] by [[Harmony\|Harmony]], Mistborn became unheard of as Allomancy's power continued to degrade. The Terris people also interbred with the survivors of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], which combined with the slaughter of all living Feruchemists at the time left Feruchemy also diluted, and so Ferrings began to appear.

## Metalborn and Twinborn
**Metalborn** refers to those who have Allomantic or Feruchemical abilities. Such label can be used to refer to those who have access to all sixteen metals, Mistborns and full Feruchemists, as well as Mistings and Ferrings, who can only access a single power. [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgists]] are not included under this term as Hemalurgy is not an inborn ability. The useage of Metalborn as a label did not seem to appear until after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], which may be a result of the Lord Ruler suppressing knowledge of Feruchemy during the time of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].
[[Twinborn\|Twinborn]] refers to someone who is both a Misting and a Ferring. They are extremely rare, and their Allomantic and Feruchemical powers seem to be independently determined, resulting in many interesting combinations of Investiture. Having access to both of these streams of the Metallic Arts also allows Twinborn to [[Compounding\|Compound]] their Feruchemical abilities.

### The God Metals
For information on all Shards God Metals, see [[God Metal\|God Metal]].
The God Metals are metals formed directly from a [[Shard\|Shard]]. Previously only the God Metals of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]] were known, however new God Metals can be made from any Shard. They can be alloyed with the lesser metals to form sixteen different metals each, though few are known. They can also be alloyed with each other. Besides having an Allomantic, a Feruchemical, and a Hemalurgic property, each God Metal can also do something else. The Vessel of the Shard can slightly change the properties of its God Metal over time, but not the main functions of what it does.

### Harmonium
After contact with the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]], a new metal is revealed. Called "[[Ettmetal\|Ettmetal]]" in their native tongue, the Southern Peoples use it to power their technology. Harmonium burns "with a pure whiteness" when used in Southern Scadrian machinery, and explodes when it is exposed to water (similar to the ) making it dangerous if not impossible to ingest for allomantic purposes. Unlike alkali metal reactions, this reaction does not yield a "Harmonium oxide," but it will yield "something else relevant to the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]." Harmonium's atomic structure is that of a single element, rather than a compound or alloy.

### Trellium
[[Trellium\|Trellium]] is the uncanonical name for the unknown metal seen in [[Shadows of Self\|Shadows of Self]]. It is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust. Its Allomantic and Feruchemical properties are unknown. It can be used Hemalurgically to steal some, if not all, Allomantic and/or Feruchemical abilities and grant them to [[Kandra\|Kandra]]. It can also be used on humans to create hemalurgic constructs. Kandra and Hemalurgic constructs with a single spike of Trellium will be hidden from Harmony.
