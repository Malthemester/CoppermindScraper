## Geography
Desh is a small nation that is situated at the foot of a mountainous area in western Roshar. It borders [[Azir\|Azir]] to the east and [[Yezier\|Yezier]] to the south. [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] lies to the west and [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]] to the north, but they are separated by the mountains. During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Desh was a part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]].

## Politics and Culture
As a member of the Azish empire, Desh formally recognizes the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] as its emperor. In practice, the member states of the empire are generally self-governing, although they follow Azir's lead in international matters and maintain deference to the emperor through certain cultural customs.
People from Desh were common visitors to the [[Tashikk\|Tashikki]] city of [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]]. [[Lift\|Lift]] characterizes their clothing as "rural" in appearance with lighter colors, similar to clothing worn in [[Alm\|Alm]]. Many of Desh's inhabitants are nomads, who travel between various waystops. Such waystops are typically marked by stone obelisks.

## History
Lift visited Desh in her past and enjoyed it, as few people had tried to kill her during her time there.
One of Desh's ambassadors was in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] when [[Noura\|Noura]] told [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] that the [[Makabak\|Makabak]] empire would join his coalition against [[Odium\|Odium]].
