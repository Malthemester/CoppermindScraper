**Atara** is Duke [[Telrii\|Telrii's]] wife from [[Arelon\|Arelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is small, even among the Arelene. She has shoulder-length curly auburn hair, and she wears expensive clothing and jewelry. Her laugh is a "quiet twitter". [[Sarene\|Sarene]] observes that Atara's needlepoint patterns are always conservative and unimaginative. Her name is based on Aon Ata, meaning grace or smoothness.

## History
Atara was likely the mother of [[Soine\|Soine]], Duke Telrii's daughter who was taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] and banished to [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] eight years after the [[Reod\|Reod]], although he publicly claimed that she had died of [[Dionia\|dionia]]. It is not clear if Atara was complicit in this cover-up.
Atara regularly participated in Queen [[Eshen\|Eshen's]] needlepoint group along with a number of prominent Arelene women including [[Seaden\|Seaden]], [[Torena\|Torena]], and [[Daora\|Daora]]. She was present when Sarene joined a meeting of the group. Atara remarked that [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] was not very different than [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], and Seaden warned her not to speak that way around priests. Sarene mentioned that there were some notable differences in the two religions, but Atara brushed this off as irrelevant.
She was shocked when Sarene offered to teach the Arelene women to fence. When the group told Sarene that Arelene men did not know how to fence either, Atara mentioned that [[Raoden\|Raoden]] was one of the few exceptions to that rule. [[Eondel\|Eondel]] later helped teach the women to fence, and Atara was surprisingly adept with a practice sword, although she was flustered when Eondel touched her wrist while correcting her form.
Atara was seen at Telrii's side during a lavish party thrown at their mansion. She presumably became queen when Telrii was crowned as king after [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] death. Her fate after Telrii's death is unknown.
