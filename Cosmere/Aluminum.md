**Aluminum** is the internal enhancement pulling metal. An [[Allomancy\|Allomancer]] burning aluminum will make all of their metal reserves vanish. [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] can use aluminum to store [[Identity\|Identity]], and when used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, aluminum removes all powers. It is known as **Ralkalest** or **the unForgeable metal** in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]] as well as among [[Singers\|singers]].
Aluminum metal (and some of its alloys) are "Allomantically inert" -- they cannot be [[Steel\|Pushed]] or [[Iron\|Pulled]], and can shield people from emotional Allomancy. Aluminum generates no [[Atium\|atium shadows]] and can create dead zones within cadmium and bendalloy bubbles, where the shielded area is not included within the time bubble. It also interferes with Feruchemical healing, by making it impossible for wounds to heal around the aluminum until it is removed from the body. There is a similar effect on pewter Allomancy.
Aluminum has been confirmed to have strange effects to all magic systems, is magically inert, and will act as an [[Investiture\|Investiture]] sink.

## Allomantic Use
An aluminum [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as an **Aluminum Gnat**. Burning aluminum causes the body to instantly metabolize its metal reserves without any other effect. As such, an Aluminum Gnat gains no useable powers from their Allomancy, however, it can be used to negate effects of other Investiture such as Withering. Only Allomantically relevant metals can be burned away. Allomancy does not affect aluminum even though the metal itself is Allomantically viable.
Since aluminum can shield against emotional Allomancy, those who can afford to, often wear hats with aluminum lining. It can also be used to block Allomantic bronze.

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of aluminum needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, it may be possible to cleanse their spirit of unwanted effects of Investiture.

## Feruchemical Use
An aluminum [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Trueself**. Aluminum is used to store "spiritual sense of [[Identity\|Identity]]." This ability is not fully understood, and is rarely discussed outside of Terris communities. A Trueself who fills an aluminummind to the point where they have no Identity and then fills another metalmind is able to produce a metalmind that any Feruchemist with the relevant power can tap. In a similar manner, a Feruchemist may be able to tap another person's metalminds by filling their own aluminummind completely. Trueselfs can heal damage done to them in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] by storing Identity, but it takes a roundabout method. Storing Identity makes the Feruchemist more susceptible to many things, such as [[Forgery\|Forgery]].
It is unclear why Identity can be stored in and withdrawn from an aluminummind when other Invested Arts cannot affect aluminum.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, aluminum removes all powers, such as Allomancy or [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]].
It is possible that encasing Hemalurgic spikes in aluminum may prevent Hemalurgic decay.

## Weaponry
Guns and bullets made from aluminum are highly effective (albeit expensive) because they cannot be [[Steel\|Pushed]], [[Iron\|Pulled]], or even detected using the sight granted by steel or iron Allomancy. Aluminum bullets are actually composed of an Allomantically inert alloy of aluminum since the ballistics of a pure aluminum bullet would not work.

## Around the Cosmere
While aluminum doesn't always directly negate all magic systems, it does have very weird, interesting effects in all places. A person having aluminum in their body would interfere with many magic systems in some way.

### Shards
Wearing aluminum can help a person resist the influence of a [[Shard\|Shard]].

### Perpendicularities
Aluminum can be used to take liquid from a [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]], and it will stay Invested.

### Final Empire
The [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] kept aluminum and its alloy [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] from public knowledge to give the [[Inquisitors\|Inquisitors]] an advantage. During his rule, aluminum was harvested from the [[Ashmounts\|Ashmounts]].

### Forgery
Known as ralkalest in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]], aluminum cannot be altered at all via [[Forgery\|Forgery]].
The cells for Forgers in the [[Rose Palace\|Rose Palace]] have ralkalest grates in their ceilings for entrance and a thin plate of ralkalest behind the stone walls.

### Nalthis
Aluminum cannot be [[Awakening\|Awakened]]. It is possible for aluminum to prevent someone from [[Returned\|Returning]], but not simply by stabbing the body: aluminum is inert and blocks Investiture, but does not actively absorb it. Aluminum can also block an Awakener's life sense.
[[Nightblood\|Nightblood's]] sheath is made of aluminum. On Roshar, a [[Fused\|Fused]] uses Nightblood's sheath to block an attack from [[Szeth\|Szeth]], who was wielding Nightblood.

### Roshar
>“*There are legends of metal that can block a Shardblade. A metal that falls from the sky. Silver, but somehow lighter.*”
\-Taravangian on aluminum[30]


Items may be able to be [[Soulcasting\|Soulcast]] into aluminum. However, aluminum resists attempts to Soulcast it into other [[Ten Essences\|Essences]]. [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] are unable to cut aluminum through magical means but would be able to cut it physically, like a conventional blade, if the aluminum were thin enough. Aluminum can block [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] communication, and can prevent Soulcasting from being detected by others. Aluminum cannot be affected by the [[Surge\|Surges]] [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]] or [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]]. It interferes with most Radiant powers.
Highmarshal Azure was given metal sheets by [[Wit\|Wit]] during her time in Kholinar that were possibly aluminum. When lining a room, they allowed for the use of Soulcasting [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] without detection by the [[Voidspren\|Voidspren]].
The Unkalaki people are able to obtain aluminium by trading with the spren world, and are aware that it has an effect on spren.
During the expedition to Aimia, [[Rushu\|Rushu]] is tasked by [[Navani\|Navani]] to experiment with aluminum and discover the details of its impact on fabrials. She first notes that the thickness of the metal may impact its effect on fabrial operation (e.g. block vs modify). After tinkering with a spanreed and aluminum foil, [[Huio\|Huio]] theorizes that the spren react to aluminum "almost like prey react to a predator" and that it interferes with the spren's ability to sense thoughts. [[Rushu\|Rushu]] further theorizes that each axis of motion and rotation could be blocked separately by proper application of aluminum. It is likely that other types of fabrials (i.e. heating fabrials) could be modified similarly.
This experimentation accidentally resulted in a series of modified fabrials in which the mechanism contained bits of aluminum foil that blocked certain functions, but not all. Among these were a spanreed that transferred lateral motion, but not vertical; a lift to permit [[Rysn\|Rysn]] to move between decks of the [[Wandersail\|Wandersail]] and a number of "wheelchair" fabrials which levitated and permitted [[Rysn\|Rysn]] to maneuver while seated using a partially aluminum-blocked counterweight. These are particularly useful due to a known drawback of motion-transferring fabrials caused by a moving frame of reference (e.g. a moving ship at sea communicating by spanreed to shore).
The Knights Radiant once lined tunnels deep beneath [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with Ralkalest, likely to protect against intrusion into the tunnels from the foothills below via Surgebinding. It is unknown whether the term Ralkalest is of Selish origin alone, or if Raboniel learned of it from another source.

## Trivia
Brandon thought of having [[Vin\|Vin]] burn [[Silver\|silver]] rather than aluminum when captured in [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]] but decided that aluminum would be less abundant.
Brandon chose aluminum for the role it serves because it is rare pre-industrial age, then becomes incredibly common, providing a way for technology to counter Allomancy.
