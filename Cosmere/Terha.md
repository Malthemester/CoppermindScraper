## Appearance
The terha is a large quadruped. The body size and shape is similar to a rhinoceros, with a thickly muscled body and thick legs. It is covered in brown carapace, with a large, oval-shaped head that has two large horns or tusks in the front and rounded armor in the back that helps protect the neck. Plates of carapace hang from its long tail, with a particularly large triangle-shaped plate at the end. It has clawed feet that appear to have opposable thumbs.

## Usage
Terha are domesticated, and are used for transportation while hunting [[Sandling\|sandlings]] in the [[Deep sand\|deep sand]]. Like [[Tonk\|tonks]], they are ridden using a saddle, bridle, and saddlebags. While tonks are used for general transportation, terha appear to be much more rare and specialized. [[Kenton\|Kenton]] has never ridden a terha before joining Lord [[Raagent\|Raagent]] for a sandling hunt. Terha that are raised to hunt have their carapace treated with a special substance called [[DoKall\|DoKall]] from infancy to prevent the carapace from dissolving when it gets wet. Raagent calls them tough, and they are not as skittish as tonks.

## Taxonomy
Terha have superficial similarities to both tonks and some species of [[Sandling\|sandlings]], with both having horns and water-soluble carapace. It is unknown if there is a relation, natural or bred, between the creatures.
