**Flowers of Night's Last Kiss** is the name [[Hesho\|Hesho]] gives to [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] flight on [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]] after he and Spensa agree that **Flight Fifteen**, the name assigned to them by the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] command, is too boring. Although the most of the members of the flight pick callsigns, in the end they don't actually use them and instead just go with their actual names.
