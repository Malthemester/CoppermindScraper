**Tathingdwen** is the capital of the [[Terris Dominance\|Terris Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
It is not clear if Tathingdwen existed prior to the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]], but in the Final Empire period, it contained the [[Synod\|Synod]], the ruling council of the [[Keeper\|Keepers]]. [[Sazed\|Sazed]] had been to Tathingdwen, and when he left the city to join [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]], he said he left in disgrace, with the common people cursing him. This indicates that the common people knew of the Keepers.
After the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]], [[Sazed\|Sazed]] falsely claimed to know the location of the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]: Mount [[Derytatith\|Derytatith]]. Sazed sent [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] to [[Terris\|Terris]] to find it, with [[Spook\|Spook]] accompanying them. Vin later discovered the correct location of the Well--in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]--using her enhanced [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], and when she said that Sazed had lied to them, Spook confirmed it was true. Spook was to tell them it was false when they reached Tathingdwen, so they would not die in the [[Terris Mountains\|Terris Mountains]]. Vin and Elend turned back, heading back to Luthadel instead.
Dozens of [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] under [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] control, along with an army of [[Koloss\|koloss]], attacked Tathingdwen around (or possibly after) the time of the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]]. The local Terris forces fought the koloss as the Inquisitors hunted the Keepers and the [[Synod\|Synod]], presumably so the Inquisitors could steal their [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]] abilities with [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]. Tathingdwen was burned to the ground, and Terris was left in ruins. Spook and Elend met Terris refugees on their way back to Luthadel.
