\-'May the Sand Lord bless us!' in Karshad[1]


**Karshad** is a holy language spoken by members of the Priest [[DaiKeen\|DaiKeen]], the [[Kerzta\|Kerztian]] clergy on [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
When [[Khriss\|Khriss]] first arrived on [[Dayside\|Dayside]], she and [[Cynder\|Cynder]] recognized Karshad as the language being spoken by a zealous man at a rally of Kerztian warriors. They later learned that the man was the [[A'Kar\|A'Kar]], presumably inciting the warriors on their way to attack the [[Diem\|Diem]].
