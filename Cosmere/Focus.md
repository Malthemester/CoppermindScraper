A **focus** is a specific magic-related term in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. It is the method by which [[Investiture\|Investiture]] can be formed into magical effects. Magic systems and magical engineering use these focuses to filter [[Investiture\|Investiture]] into a magical effect. The focus is determined by the interaction of the [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] and a [[Shard\|Shard]] but the World is the key factor and all magics will use the focus in some way, how it is used is determined by the interaction of the [[Shard\|Shards]].

## Magic systems and their Focus
### Sel Magics
**Shape Based**


### Scadrial Magics

It is implied in [[Ars Arcanum\|Ars Arcanum]] that hemalurgy could be used on other shardworlds "To form Connections that no [[Shard\|Shard]] ever intended."

### Nalthis Magics
**Command based**


### Roshar Magics
**Symbiosis based**


## Magic Sciences and Their Focus
Magic Sciences use [[Investiture\|Investiture]] without direct alteration of the [[Spiritweb\|Spiritweb]]

### Roshar sciences

### Scadrial sciences

Scadrial sciences are used commonly in the southern hemisphere. They involve medallions that are filled by [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], but left unkeyed and [[Unsealed metalminds\|unsealed]]. This means that anybody, even non-Feruchemists, can use them. Only certain combinations can be worn.


In southern Scadrial, they have used the combination of Allomancy and Feruchemy to create flying, airplane-like ships.

## Magic without direct Shard influence
Worlds without a [[Shard\|Shard]] often have no active magic that the people living on them can directly use.
