**Han ShuXen** is a painter from the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. His paintings are well-known and extremely valuable in the Empire.
He painted the masterpiece *Lily of the Spring Pond* for a woman he loved. On her death, her children gave the painting to the Rose Empire; it is owned by the [[Arbiter\|arbiter]] [[Frava\|Frava]]. However, ShuXen felt that the painting should not outlive its intended recipient and did not want it used to glorify the Rose Empire. He hired the [[Forger\|Forger]] [[Wan ShaiLu\|Wan ShaiLu]], whom he had tutored in her youth, to destroy it and replace it with a copy. Shai felt that she owed a debt to her former mentor and agreed to the plan.
ShuXen assists Shai in making a masterful copy of *Lily of the Spring Pond*, providing his studies for the original painting and advice on the brushwork. Shai also makes a second copy of passable quality that she uses as a decoy. Shai is able to execute the plan and burns the original painting, replacing it with the master forgery.
In his old age he has gone blind and can barely move.
