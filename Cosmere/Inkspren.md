**Inkspren** are a race of sapient [[Spren\|spren]] that dwell primarily in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] of Roshar.
They tend to be attracted to those who are logical and willing to think through their decisions, as opposed to acting on instinct. They can form [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]], giving people the powers of the [[Order of Elsecallers\|Order of Elsecallers]].

## Appearance
### Physical Realm
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], inkspren look exactly like their cognitive form, but are able to change their size.

### Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], Inkspren are humanoid, and their form does not change. They have angular features, more reminiscent of an unfinished statue than a real person. They are entirely black, as if made of shadows, and have marble-like skin with a prismatic quality as though it has been coated in a thin layer of oil. Their skin shimmers and gleams in a variety of colors depending on how the light hits it.
They wear stiff, fashionable clothing that matches their shade and texture; the clothing is part of their essence. They sometimes carry weapons like swords, which may or may not be sheathed, and sometimes hang in the air besides them. They have armor as part of their form, similar to carapace.

## Abilities
Unlike other sapient spren, inkspren cannot shape-shift or make themselves invisible to humans while in the Physical Realm; they are, however, capable of drastically changing their size. They can become as large as a person and as small as a speck of dust, letting them move about unseen if they so wish. They are also capable of blending into shadows.

### Nahel bond
Inkspren are one of the spren types capable of forming [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] with humans. The bond makes a person a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]], and grants the powers of [[Transformation\|Transformation]] and [[Transportation\|Transportation]].

Inkspren have a particular way of speaking, using "be" instead of phrases like "be here" or "exist" -- for example, "a spren is" rather than "there's a spren here", or "a traitor is" instead of "a traitor exists". They prefer simple, limited body language.
They dislike humans for their irrational and changing nature, and admire those among them who are willing to be cautious, logical and unemotional. Their society as a whole is hostile to the idea of reforming the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], believing that death is the only option for a bonded spren. It's implied they'd be willing to kill a bonded human to "rescue" their kinsmen from such a fate, even if the inkspren entered the bond willingly. There are very few of them interested in attempting the Nahel bond again, with [[Ivory\|Ivory]] seemingly the only one to dare to do so. It seems he is not entirely alone in his views, however, as several other inkspren accompany him to watch the beginnings of his bond with [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]].
It's uncertain if inkspren have their own nation in Shadesmar, although they are very common in cities like [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]].
