**Ilamar** was the cavalrylord for [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] army.
Ilamar was an Alethi man, however his dark hair had a few red patches, and he had a long red moustache, implying some [[Veden\|Veden]] or [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] heritage as well. He also wore a long red mustache. Ilamar had a squat but compact frame.
In [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] decisive battle against Highprince [[Kalanor\|Kalanor]], Ilamar and his group of fifty cavalrymen were armed with hooks and ropes for attacking enemy [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]].
Ilamar notifies Dalinar that the cavalry was ready before heading into the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], but [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] delays the excursion, demanding to enter the Kholin warcamp to investigate an assassination attempt on the king.
Dalinar confers with Ilamar and [[Teleb\|Teleb]] before assaulting the [[Tower (Roshar)\|Tower]], as [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas]] approaches to discuss tactics.
He died during the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], along with [[Havar\|Havar]], [[Perethom\|Perethom]] and six thousand more members of Kholin army.
