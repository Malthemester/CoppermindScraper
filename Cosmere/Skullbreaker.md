>“*The club hadn’t been impressive, but it had been special because Chet had helped me make it.*”
\-Spensa after losing Skullbreaker[1]


**Skullbreaker** is a makeshift weapon [[Spensa\|Spensa]] created while in the [[Belt\|belt]] of the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]] after losing her rifle. She creates it by finding a sturdy stick that had fallen from a tree, then stripping the bark. Spensa tries to lash a stone to the head of the club with a vine, but fails. [[Chet\|Chet]] uses a spare shoelace from his boot to tie the stone in place, showing Spensa how to do it.
After the [[Delver\|Delvers]] send a fragment to destroy the one Chet and Spensa are on, Spensa lost Skullbreaker in the chaos. Spensa had been fond of Skullbreaker, and was saddened by its loss.
