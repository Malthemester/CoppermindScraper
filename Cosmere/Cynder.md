## History
>“*But this isn’t Darkside, Jon. It’s a new culture, one in the process of blending. I wouldn’t be surprised to find a contact language developing--a pidgin between Dynastic and Lossandin.*”
\-Cynder[1]

Professor Cynder traveled to Dayside with [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]], [[Baon\|Baon]], and [[Jon Acron\|Jon Acron]]. He and Acron were fascinated with the cultural and linguistic differences of Dayside. When they were passing through [[Ker Kedasha\|Ker Kedasha]] he was barely able to understand some of a speech delivered by the [[A'Kar\|A'Kar]].
After losing their guide and running out of water, Cynder and Baon found [[Kenton\|Kenton]] passed out in a tent, dehydrated from his fight with the [[Kerztian\|Kerztians]], and helped revive him. When he and the travelling party were ambushed by [[Kerzta\|Kerztian]] warriors on their way to [[Kezare\|Kezare]], Cynder was shot in the arm by a [[Zinkall\|zinkall]] arrow. Kenton showed him how to remove the arrow safely by pouring water on the wound.
Upon arriving in [[Kezare\|Kezare]] the group discovered [[Lonzare\|Lonzare]], the Darksider section of the city. Cynder was thrilled by the mixing of Darkside and [[Lossand\|Lossandin]] culture. He suspected that a  between [[Dynastic\|Dynastic]] and Lossandin could be developing among the people living there.
The lock on Cynder's luggage malfunctioned and was repaired by Khriss as she, unsuccessfully, sought meetings with the [[Taishin\|Taishin]]. After her meeting with Kenton Cynder, while playing a game of chess with Acron, suggested that she use her diplomatic skills to help out the Diem.
He discussed the differences between Dayside sand that had been ingested by a [[Sandling\|sandling]], Dayside sand that had water poured on it, and Darkside sand with Khriss when she was doing experiments in her bedroom.
Cynder and Acron, having found more  for Baon to use, interrupted Khriss and Baon as she was confronting him about the incident with [[Deral\|Deral]] and his lieutenant. Shocked by what he saw, Cynder dropped the container of saltpeter to the ground where it shattered. Baon then left taking his pistols with him.
After Kenton "accepted" Khriss as a trainee [[Sand mastery\|sand master]], Khriss, Cynder, and Acron moved into the [[Diem\|Diem]]. After they had arrived, Cynder remarked how strange it was for Baon to have turned out to be a spy,since he was always so loyal. He then suggested that any of them might also be a spy. Acron laughed it off, calling his suggestion "preposterous", and Acron joined him, laughing as well. Khriss gave him [[Gevalden\|Gevalden's]] pistol which she had received from [[Nilto\|Nilto]] to Cynder so he could use it to guard her. He accompanied Khriss when she went with Kento to visit [[Vey\|Vey]].
Acron went with Khriss, Kenton, and [[Delius\|Delius]] when they went to [[Lraezare\|Lraezare]] to find Vey. He helped Khriss revive Kenton when he passed out from [[Overmastery\|overmastery]].
He went with Khriss to watch Kenton's duel with [[Drile\|Drile]]. Two weeks after the final vote of the [[Taishin\|Taishin]] on the Diem's fate, Khriss Baon, and Cynder set sail for Elis, taking [[Dirin\|Dirin]] with them.

## Quotes
>“*Cynder: Oh we're not going to have this discussion again are we, Jon?*
\-Acron: They're maintaining culture first--language is only a by-product.
Cynder: Yes, well I'm the linguist, which means I get to name it.

## Trivia
In [[White Sand Volume 1\|White Sand Volume 1]] Jon Acron and Cynder's speech bubbles are occasionally misattributed, particularly when they converse with one another. Noting the clothing of the speaker and context of the quote is required to catch these mistakes. For example, Acron wears white in most of Volume 1, though in at least one frame their clothing was switched.
