**Sakin** is a resident of a small port on the eastern edge of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Sakin's village is located within the former kingdom of [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]], and Sakin is presumably [[Natan\|Natan]] like the other townsfolk, including [[Puuli\|Puuli]].
She moved to a fine stone hut behind the northern cliffs of the village after marrying her third husband, and she had been looking forward to growing a garden there. When the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] came, her husband was unfortunately lost at sea; she had lost her first two husbands the same way. Puuli briefly stopped to comfort her in her grief while he was gathering scrap wood after the storm.
