## Appearance and Personality
Unlike living Cryptics, her head pattern is broken, with the same scraping over the eyes seen on other deadeye spren in the center of it. Instead of turning in a smooth pattern, the lines are twisted in jagged patterns, like broken fingers, giving the head a wilted look. Her stiff robes look dustier than [[Pattern\|Pattern's]].
According to Shallan, Testament was a kindly and friendly spren.

## Abilities and Attributes
Being a Cryptic, Testament is able to form [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] with humans. This gives the bonded human access to the [[Surges\|Surges]] of the [[Order of Lightweavers\|Order of Lightweavers]], namely [[Illumination\|Illumination]] and [[Transformation\|Transformation]].

## History
Not much is known about Testament's past. For centuries, she was a friend and a business partner to an [[Inkspren shopkeeper\|inkspren shopkeeper]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]].
In 1165, Testament left [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] to form a Nahel bond. She later bonded to [[Shallan\|Shallan]].
In a duration of about two years Shallan and Testament's bond progressed enough for her to summon Testament as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], which she later used to kill her mother in self-defense. Horrified by what she had done, still only a child and in a state of grief and trauma, Shallan broke her bond to Testament the same day, blaming her. Later, due to Shallan blocking her memories to cope with the pain, it was assumed that the Cryptic that Shallan was bonded to as a child was Pattern and that their bond had been weakened by the event due to Shallan's resentment of the sword. In reality, Shallan used Testament as a Blade, then abandoned their bond, causing Testament to become a deadeye. Pattern bonded Shallan for the first time years later, although Shallan believed that some of her powers somehow functioned in the gap between her spren bonds.
Testament's inkspren friend later found her as a deadeye, sitting on a far off island in the east. She seemed to want to travel towards [[Nameless\|Nameless]], where the inkspren set up a shop; Testament stayed nearby.
In 1175, Adolin found her in Nameless through [[Mayalaran\|Maya]]. She was later brought to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] by the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]]. While in Lasting Integrity, Shallan talked to her at least once.
