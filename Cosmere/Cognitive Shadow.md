>“*And if you let a man die with too Invested a soul—or Invest him right as he’s dying—he’ll leave behind a shadow you can nail back onto a body.*”
\-Zahel’s description of a Cognitive Shadow[2]


**Cognitive Shadow** is a term used to refer to a spirit that has not yet moved into the afterlife. While the manifestations of this kind of entity can vary depending on the [[Shardworld\|world]] it occurs on, Cognitive Shadows can occur on any planet in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. [[Vasher\|Vasher]] refers to them as a Type Two Invested entity.

## Mechanics
Cognitive Shadows can be created by a variety of processes. Some of them are created when a person has sufficient attachment to something in the Physical Realm. When a [[Vessel\|Vessel]] that has held onto a [[Shard\|Shard]] for a long time dies it becomes a Cognitive Shadow that can continue to act. The Cognitive aspect of a recently deceased person can become a Cognitive Shadow by finding a source of Investiture to anchor themselves to the Cognitive Realm before passing on to the Beyond. The Investiture replaces the parts of the soul that connects it to the Three Realms, providing an anchor for it in the Cognitive Realm.  Some [[Vessel\|Vessels]] can prepare a Cognitive Shadow at or just prior to their death or [[Splinter\|Splintering]], allowing a portion of their power to continue to function with a small amount of direction; the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] is an example of this. It is theoretically possible for a Cognitive Shadow to form a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with a human. Cognitive Shadows look different in the Cognitive Realm, where how they became a Cognitive Shadow will influence how they look.
A Cognitive Shadow can be permanently killed by the use of a [[Raysium\|raysium]] dagger touching a gem of anti-Light of the type of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] associated with the Cognitive Shadow. For instance, a raysium dagger with an [[Anti-Voidlight\|anti-Voidlight]] gem can permanently kill a [[Fused\|Fused]], and a similar dagger with [[Anti-Stormlight\|anti-Stormlight]] can permanently kill a Herald. Additionally, Cognitive Shadows can be killed by negating their Connection to all three Realms, a process which destroys the anchor against the pull of the Beyond. The experience is described as having your soul ripped apart.

## Examples
### Roshar

When the [[Singers\|Singers]] turned to [[Odium\|Odium]] for help in fighting off the humans, he responded by infusing some of them with his power, which turned them into Cognitive Shadows. They reside on [[Braize\|Braize]], but return to Roshar during every [[Desolation\|Desolation]]. Since they lost their bodies long ago, they must possess the bodies of living singers; in doing so they destroy the mind of the possessed body. This cycle of rebirth strains the minds of the Fused and, eventually, they go crazy. When this happens, they instead possess chunks of rock and become a [[Thunderclast\|Thunderclast]] during the Desolations. Their status as Cognitive Shadows grants them access to the [[Surge\|Surges]]. Odium could remove the Investiture that maintains a Fused, which would send that Fused to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]].


When the Heralds of [[The Almighty\|The Almighty]] took up the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], they gained a direct connection to [[Honor\|Honor]]. This connection transformed them into Cognitive Shadows. Each time they return to Roshar, a new body is created for them. Unlike the [[Returned\|Returned]], they do not need to consume Investiture to remain in their bodies.


Prior to Odium's splintering of Honor, the Stormfather was just the [[Spren\|spren]] of the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] and one of the three [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren. After Honor's death, the Cogntive Shadow of its Vessel, Tanavast, merged with the Stormfather, though it does not appear that the Stormfather has Tanavast's memories.

### Scadrial

>“*Look at you Kelsier! You haven't form or shape. You're not alive, you're an idea. A memory of a man holding the power will never be as potent as a real one with ties to all three Realms.*”
\-Ruin on Kelsier's Ascension[23]

After his death, Kelsier found the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] in the Cognitive Realm and, with [[Leras\|Leras']] help, merged with it. As a result, he became infused with [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] power and became a Cognitive Shadow, though, since the Well was created as a prison, he was unable to leave. After [[Vin\|Vin]] released [[Ruin\|Ruin]] from the Well he was able to travel the Scadrian Cognitive Realm and influence the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], though he was unable to actually leave the Cognitve Realm because his "ties to the Physical Realm [had] been severed" by his death. With the help of a device made by the [[Ire\|Ire]], he was able to hold the [[Shard\|Shard]] of Preservation after Leras died, though, according to Ruin, he made for a weaker [[Vessel\|Vessel]] than a normal person. Some time after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], Kelsier found a way to recreate his physical body and return to the Physical Realm.

### Nalthis

When [[Endowment\|Endowment]] Returns someone after death, she uses a Divine Breath to "staple" the Cognitive Shadow of the deceased person back to that person's body. This process results in the Returned losing any memories of their prior life. Returned must consume one Breath every eight days to fuel their Divine Breath. [[Vasher\|Vasher]] states that he is a Type Two Invested Entity because he died while “drenched in power” and left behind a “fossil of a soul”.


If a Lifeless were created with extra Breath, that Breath might start to take on a "personality" like a Cognitive Shadow would have.

### Threnody

Shades are a unique kind of Cognitive Shadow found on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] that are able to interact with the Physical Realm. They are drawn by anyone moving quickly at night, lighting a fire, or drawing blood and their touch withers a person, which usually results in death. Any person or animal killed by a Shade becomes a Shade. It is unknown how the first Shades were created, though, when [[Nazh\|Nazh]] first meets Kelsier, he is shocked that Kelsier managed to become a Cognitive Shadow and says it is "an important rite ... with requirements and traditions." Shades are repelled and can be harmed by silver, though it is unknown whether this applies to other kinds of Cognitive Shadows as well. They also are not as self-aware as normal Cognitive Shadows. If some other Cognitive Shadow traveled to Threnody, he or she would not become a Shade, and if a Shade managed to leave Threnody, it would not be destroyed. Differences between Shades and normal Cognitive Shadows are a result of the nature of the Investiture on Threnody and the lack of a Shard.

## Trivia
The mist spirit that Vin sees during [[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]] is *not* a Cognitive Shadow. Depending on the scene, it was an actual manifestation of Preservation or Ruin's imitation of that manifestation.
