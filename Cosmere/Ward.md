A **ward** is a female apprentice to a [[Vorin\|Vorin]] scholar on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Wards seem to be a concept limited to [[Vorin\|Vorin]] [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]. A scholarly woman can take on one or more students and teach them numerous subjects, such as mathematics, logic, art or natural history. Such a teacher cannot be forced to accept a ward, and can set conditions that must be fulfilled before a prospective candidate is accepted. In exchange for education, the ward serves as a scribe and assistant to her teacher.
The wardship can be broken off at any point by either the teacher or the ward, but formally it ends only when the teacher decides that her student has at least met the minimum requirements of professional scholarship.

## Known wards
[[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] is a ward to [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]]. Numerous women attempted to become Jasnah's ward, with twelve applying in year 1173 alone. Shallan was the only one to convince Jasnah to accept her. The wardship continues even after Shallan becomes a [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]].
Jasnah had one other ward, long before Shallan. However, this went poorly, and the two eventually parted ways.
[[Teshav Khal\|Teshav Khal]] has numerous wards, including two with senior status. In the course of her duties, she's always accompanied by at least one: there is one when she's meeting with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] in the warcamps; [[Teshav's ward\|one]] at the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]; two when speaking with [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] via [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]; one when [[Tezim\|Tezim]] replies to Dalinar's missive; and one when [[Azimir\|Azimir]] threatens to destroy their [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. As the wards are never named, it's unclear how many are there, and which of the above are the same people. [[Janala Lustow\|Janala Lustow]] might be one of them.
[[Litima\|Litima]] has a single ward who accompanies her when she reads a passage of [[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]] to [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]].
[[Karavaniga\|Karavaniga]], granddaughter of king [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], becomes a ward to an unknown scholar shortly after her grandfather becomes the king of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]].
A number of wards are present during a feast on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
[[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] doesn't have any wards of her own, but occasionally borrows some from other lighteyes in the warcamp.

## Trivia
In *The Way of Kings Prime*, the early version of *Stormlight Archive*, Jasnah has a ward named Shinri. Shinri eventually evolved into [[Shallan\|Shallan]], though the differences are vast enough that Brandon considers them to be separate characters. The mention of Jasnah having had another ward a long time ago might be an allusion to Shinri.
