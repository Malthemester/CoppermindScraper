>“*The Unmade are a deviation, a flair, a conundrum that may not be worth your time. You cannot help but think of them. They are fascinating. Many are mindless. Like the spren of human emotions, only much more nasty. I do believe a few can think, however.*”
\-From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk Drawer: paragraph 14[1]


The **Unmade** are a group of nine ancient and twisted [[Spren\|spren]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] comprised of [[Splinter\|Splinters]] of [[Odium\|Odium]]. They are regarded as minions of Odium, but not all of them continue to do his bidding. While they are traditionally depicted as personifications of destruction or forces, some of them are cognizant individuals. Each Unmade is endowed with vast and terrible powers, although the intelligence of the Unmade vary drastically.
[[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]], the most intelligent of the Unmade, has three parts in her compound name, while [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], and [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]] have two parts in a compound name and have displayed a level of awareness. Unmade such as [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] and [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]], have shown themselves to be mere creatures of instinct.

## Characteristics
### Creation
>“*The Lady of Pains has the Surge of Transformation and dangerous knowledge. She will infuse my entire heart-the pillar-in the proper order, using her Voidlight. In so doing, she would corrupt me and leave me… leave me as one of the Unmade…*”
\-The Sibling[14]


The specific process of how [[Odium\|Odium]] created the Unmade is unknown, but they were Unmade by his hand.
One process of unmaking is documented with [[Raboniel\|Raboniel's]] attempt to unmake the [[Sibling\|Sibling]]. While [[Investiture\|Invested]] with [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]], Raboniel placed her hands on the Sibling's pillar. The Sibling reacted by glowing with [[Towerlight\|Towerlight]]. The Voidlight moved from Raboniel into the pillar's embedded garnets, starting the process of corruption. If she had been able to continue, The Sibling says she would infuse the entire pillar with Voidlight in the proper order and utilize the Surge of Transformation.
The [[Sibling\|Sibling]] considers being unmade into something else as equivalent to death.
[[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] believes Odium could unmake the Unmade again. This would steal their memories and rip them to pieces. She also fears he will unmake her children, both true spren and lesser spren, to the same effect.
It is uncertain what the Unmade were before becoming corrupted. Upon her confrontation with [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]] believes her to have originally been a [[Creationspren\|creationspren]], but later thinks it might in fact have been *human*.

### Functioning
In creating Unmade, Odium trapped them in a halfway existence, many not fully belonging to the Physical or Cognitive Realms. Sja-anat experiences a shadowy version of both Shadesmar and the Physical Realm at the same time, feeling the distance dilation between the two as she moves.
Some of the Unmade manifest various forms in the Physical Realm if they reside too long in the same place or are pulled through by strong emotions.
Some are practically mindless, more like emotion spren, others are intelligent, crafty and conniving.
Unmade are [[Investiture\|Invested]] enough that they have been able to push through [[Urithiru\|Urithiru's]] [[Suppression fabrial\|suppression]] effect, depending on the circumstances.
Buildings under the influence of an Unmade cannot be drawn by [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweavers]].

### Capturing
>“*You see, it can only be bested by someone who deeply, sincerely, understands it.*”
\-Dalinar Kholin[13]


An Unmade may be captured in a [[Polestone\|polestone]] like other spren, but to do so seems to require both someone who deeply understands them and a perfect gemstone. Unmade are able to think while in captivity but can not break free. Unmade do not fade during captivity, unlike [[Heralds\|Heralds]].
Prior to the [[Day of Recreance\|Recreance]], a [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]] managed to trap [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], an act previously thought impossible. Re-Shephir then escaped her imprisonment by unknown means centuries before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. After the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] arrived at [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], she once again encountered a Lightweaver, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]]. Sensing the similarities between Shallan's powers and those of the Lightweaver who had trapped her in the past, Re-Shephir fled rather than risk being imprisoned again.
The [[Urithiru gem archive\|Urithiru gem archive]] includes a theory that [[Melishi\|Melishi]], a [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Bondsmith]], would be required to trap [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] in a special prison. A [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] strike team was successful in capturing Ba-Ado-Mishram in a gemstone at the end of the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]], which cut off her [[Connection\|Connection]] to the [[Singers\|singers]]. Most of the details of this capture are unknown, other than several Heralds, including [[Nale\|Nale]] and [[Kalak\|Kalak]], being present.
During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] used his intimate knowledge about the Thrill's nature, and the method of capturing spren through coaxing them into a [[Polestone\|gemstone]], to capture [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] in the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]]. It is unclear whether or not he utilized the [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Bondsmith]] Surge of Adhesion to aid with his [[Connection\|Connection]] to the Thrill and it is also unknown if this is the same method that the ancient Radiants used.

## History
### During the Desolations
The origin of the Unmade is uncertain, but they are believed to have come into existence before the start of human civilization on Roshar. They have been implied to have once been something else before being made into the Unmade, but for now there is no indication what they once were. They were active in the Desolations, aiding Odium's troops in the conflict with their various skills. Urithiru was equipped with some sort of protection against the Unmade. Between Desolations, the Unmade lose their bond to Odium. Since [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], they have remained subtly active on Roshar, probably operating with diminished capacity. They have also slumbered at times, or entered a period of inactivity. About 2,500 years after Aharietiam, [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] instigated the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]] by [[Connection\|Connecting]] with the [[Singer\|singers]] and granting them forms of power and [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]], until she was captured in a perfect gemstone by a [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] strike team. At some point [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] was also imprisoned by a Lightweaver, but she later escaped captivity.

### True Desolation
About five generations before [[Lunamor\|Lunamor's]] time, his great-great-great-grandfather encountered one of the Unmade in the Horneater Peaks.
The arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] revitalized the Unmade. As the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] continued and the [[Fused\|Fused]] returned, the Unmade's influence increased. The death rattles allowed by the presence of [[Moelach\|Moelach]] have been noted in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] and the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] . [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] was discovered to be hiding in the core of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] by the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] and was driven out by [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]]. In the besieged city of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn's]] influence disrupted the leadership in the city while [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] corrupted the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] spren, turning it into a trap for [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] rescue party. Queen [[Aesudan Kholin\|Aesudan Kholin]] consumed a gemstone and worked with [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]], but was eventually consumed by it. In the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Yelig-nar joined with [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]] for the fighting and [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul's]] influence helped [[Voidspren\|Voidspren]] bond with [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas's]] soliders, turning them into warriors for Odium. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and his men defeated Yelig-nar, while [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] successfully managed to capture Nergaoul in a [[King's Drop\|perfect gem]]. [[Navani\|Navani]] has been researching the Unmade, but little factual information was found on them aside from in [[Hessi\|Hessi's]] *Mythica*.

### After the Battle of Thaylen Field
[[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul's]] gemstone prison was put in an aluminum box and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
[[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] shared information about the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] with the [[Fused\|Fused]].
[[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] has been using her Enlightened [[Spren\|spren]] children to influence events according to her designs, while trying to convince [[Odium\|Odium]] she isn't actively trying to undermine him. This influence, through the lure of corrupted [[Windspren\|windspren]], allowed [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] to kill Odium's [[Vessel\|Vessel]], [[Rayse\|Rayse]], and take up the [[Shard\|Shard]] himself. Also, at [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] request, Sja-anat sent [[Tumi\|Tumi]], a corrupted [[Mistspren\|mistspren]], to investigate bonding a member of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]], but [[Tumi\|Tumi]] chose to bond [[Rlain\|Rlain]] instead, at [[Renarin\|Renarin's]] suggestion.
[[Taravangian\|Taravangian's]] [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]] indicates one or more Unmade has set up in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. [[Ishar\|Ishar]] claims that he saved the [[Shin\|Shin]] after they accepted the Unmade and tried to make gods of them.
While negotiating the contest of champions with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], [[Odium\|Odium]] claims he can demand the Unmade retreat, but not all currently obey his will.

## Culture
In Rosharan culture, by the time of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the Unmade have become mythologized heavily. In fact there are disagreements about the number of Unmade; some stories claim there were ten. In [[Vorin\|Vorin]] theology they are spoken of vaguely and are typically combined into one entity. Even still, [[Ardent\|ardents]] tell old folktales and stories of the Unmade. The Unmade are often referred to as spirits of the void or nine shadows that moved in the night. They are considered to be princes of the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] in story, and feature in elaborate songs, poetry, and epics. People ascribe dozens of names and powers to each Unmade, making it difficult to determine truth from falsehood centuries later. There are tales of them corrupting spren and people both. Some people fear that things like talking chickens will bring the eyes of the Unmade upon them. However, many in the modern day consider them to be nothing more than simple folklore. Scholarly works that involve the Unmade are often mocked and dismissed.
The Unmade feature heavily in the songs of the [[Listener\|listeners]], who also fear bringing the eyes of the Unmade upon them. The songs note the names of all nine Unmade, remembering them as gods the listeners swore to never follow again.
[[Sekeir\|Sekeir]], the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] who rules [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]], claims that humans thrive upon the terrible emotions of the Unmade.

## Members of the Unmade
### Ashertmarn
>“*Ashertmarn, the Heart of the Revel, is the final of the three great Mindless Unmade. His gift to men is not prophecy or battle focus, but a lust for indulgence.*”
\-From Hessi's Mythica, page 224[12]


**Ashertmarn** is a mindless Unmade that is also known as the **Heart of the Revel**. He takes the form of an enormous, black, inhuman heart that grows veins into the ground. Those who fall under Ashertmarn's influence are driven to debauchery and excess, in extreme cases to the point of total mindless indulgence. Ashertmarn was most recently seen in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], grown over the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] there, where he managed to influence many of the Alethi elite to abandon their lives and responsibilities in favor of the revel. His location is unknown after he left the Oathgate platform.

### Ba-Ado-Mishram
>“*I find Ba-Ado-Mishram to be the most interesting of the Unmade. She is said to have been keen of mind, a highprincess among the enemy forces, their commander during some of the Desolations. I do not know how this relates to the ancient god of the enemy, named Odium.*”
\-From Hessi's Mythica, page 203[12]


**Ba-Ado-Mishram** is one of the most intelligent Unmade. She is crafty and conniving. She served as one of Odium's commanders during the [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. About 2,500 years after Aharietiam, she [[Connection\|Connected]] with the vast majority of [[Singer\|singers]] instigating the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]]. She was able to grant them forms of power and provide [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]]. A [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] strike team captured Ba-Ado-Mishram in a perfect gemstone at the end of the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]], which cut off her Connection to the singers, stealing their minds, and touched the souls of all who belong to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The current location of her gemstone prison is unknown. [[Kalak\|Kalak]] was present during the capture, so he may have clues to its location. He believes Ba-Ado-Mishram should be found and released. Ba-Ado-Mishram is also being sought by the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] for unknown purposes, possibly to aid their mission of transporting [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] off [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

### Chemoarish
Little is known of the Unmade **Chemoarish**. By the modern [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], she is known as the **Dustmother** and often is conflated with the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. There is a variety of lore associated with her, but all of it is currently unknown. In [[Bavland\|Bavland]], her name is invoked as a curse.
From the length of her name, it seems unlikely that she is among the more intelligent of the Unmade.

### Dai-Gonarthis
>“*Let me no longer hurt! Let me no longer weep! Dai-Gonarthis! The Black Fisher holds my sorrow and consumes it!*”
\-Tanatesach 1173, 28 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed female street juggler. Note similarity to sample 1172-89.[67]


**Dai-Gonarthis**, also known as the **Black Fisher**, is an Unmade of median intelligence. He has not been recorded as active on Roshar recently, but may have been involved in the [[Scouring of Aimia\|Scouring of Aimia]]. There is some uncertainty in the mythology as to whether Dai-Gonarthis is one of the Unmade, but some scholars are convinced.

### Moelach
>“*Moelach is close. I can hear his wheezing, his scratching, his scraping at time like a rat breaking through walls.*”
\-Jezrien on Moelach[70]


**Moelach** is an Unmade associated with precognition and visions of the future. His presence allows for the [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattles]] that King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] used to modify the [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]]. Moelach's appearance is unknown. Moelach took up residence in Kharbranth in the year 1167 then relocated for unknown reasons seven years later to the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]].

### Nergaoul
>“*Nergaoul was known for driving forces into a battle rage, lending them great ferocity. Curiously, he did this to both sides of a conflict, Voidbringer and human. This seems common of the less self-aware spren.*”
\-From Hessi's Mythica, page 121[71]


**Nergaoul** is a mindless Unmade that is closely associated with battle rage. Nergaoul is not very intelligent, taking an animalistic joy in death and killing. He takes the form of an enormous red mist roiling with the forms of men fighting and dying. Nergaoul causes the effect known as the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], which drives men to fight far beyond when they should have given up and makes them enjoy the killing. During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], he was captured within the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]] ruby by Dalinar. Afterwards, this perfect gemstone was sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

### Re-Shephir
>“*Re-Shephir, the Midnight Mother, giving birth to abominations with her essence so dark, so terrible, so consuming. She is here! She watches me die!*”
\-Dated Shashabev, 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. Subject: a darkeyed dock-worker in his forties, father of three.[74]


**Re-Shephir** is also known as the **Midnight Mother**, and **The Spawning Mother**. She takes the form of a mass of black tarry substance that is capable of flowing over various surfaces and appears to have screaming faces bubbling to the surface. Her primary ability is to spawn the [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]], a type of spren that takes the form of creatures and people they see around them and try to understand humankind by mimicking them. She is a creature of instinct that is drawn to violence and pain. Before the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], she infiltrated Urithiru and was captured by a [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]]. After the Recreance, she escaped imprisonment and inhabited [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] for centuries, until fleeing the tower as a result of a confrontation with [[Shallan\|Shallan]]. Her current location is unknown, but at some point she reported to the [[Fused\|Fused]], incorrectly, that the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] was dead.

### Sja-anat
>“*You sacrificed some of your children so others could live. It was a law of nature. Humans didn’t understand it. But she did.*”
\-Sja-anat[5]


**Sja-anat** is known as the **Taker of Secrets**. She takes the form of a jet black shadow that points the wrong way with white holes for eyes that often appears in mirrors, as actually seeing her requires reflected light. She exists halfway between Shadesmar and the Physical Realm, experiencing both at the same time. She considers herself intelligent, but not the most clever of the Unmade. Her primary ability is to corrupt spren, which she refers to as Enlightening. She is capable of corrupting both lesser spren and true spren, as well as larger spren, such as the spren of an [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. These corrupted spren often act as her servants and messengers. She is actively working against [[Odium\|Odium]], while trying to convince him that she is not. While her alligiance to mankind is uncertain, she has taken the following actions against Odium's bidding:

Sent her children, [[Glys\|Glys]] and [[Tumi\|Tumi]], to bond allies of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]; she also has more corrupted spren willing to bond.
Saved [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and her companions from death while traveling through the [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], whose spren she had corrupted.
Sent corrupted [[Windspren\|windspren]] to [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] so that he could use them to lure Odium into the presence of [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], use the sword to destroy [[Rayse\|Rayse]], and take up the [[Shard\|Shard]] of Odium.
### Yelig-nar
>“*Yelig-nar, called Blightwind, was one that could speak like a man, though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed.*”
\-Traxil, line 33 - Jasnah's notebook[7]


**Yelig-nar**, also known as Blightwind, differs from the other Unmade. Instead of having a specific physical appearance, he is capable of joining with humans or singers who swallow his gemstone, granting them the use of all ten [[Surge\|Surges]]. Those he possesses have red eyes, grow crystals from their bodies, and appear to be wreathed in a black wind. Those that join with Yelig-nar must control him if they do not wish to be consumed by him.

## Trivia

, Canaanite plague deity, for [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]].
, Mesopotamian god of war and death, for [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]].

, Sumerian sea goddess, for [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]].
, god of Moabites and Ammonites, for [[Chemoarish\|Chemoarish]].
Unknown  for [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] and [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]].
