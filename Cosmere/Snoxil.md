Prime Aqasix **Snoxil** is a historical [[Azish\|Azish]] ruler on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] from the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
Snoxil ruled as Prime when [[Sadees\|Sadees]] the Sunmaker, an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] king and warlord attacked Azir. During his reign the kingdom was overrun and [[Azimir\|Azimir]] sacked. After his death, Snoxil's finger was preserved and kept as a relic.
When [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] attempted to bring Azir into his coalition, Snoxil's finger was brought out for the discussion as a reminder of the last time the Alethi came to Azir in force.
