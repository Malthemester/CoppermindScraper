The **Ocean of Origins** is a body of water east of the main continent on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], towards the [[Origin\|Origin]].
The shores of the Ocean of Origins are sparsely populated, with the cities of [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]] and [[Dawn's Shadow\|Dawn's Shadow]] being the only notable settlements. This is likely because [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] make landfall there, and as such hit that coast with the greatest force. To the East, the Ocean of Origins presumably connects to the [[Endless Ocean\|Endless Ocean]] on the opposite side of the planet, while from North and South, it's bracketed by [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]] and [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]].
The [[Origin\|Origin of Storms]], where the highstorms originate, lies at the far end of the Ocean of Origins. There are multiple legends talking about there being an inhabited island there, populated by people called [[Uvara\|Uvara]] in some versions of the story. The version told in New Natanan says that they are sailors who were lost while travelling the Ocean of Origins and that one day, they will come back to reclaim [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]].

## History
[[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] sailed across the Ocean of Origins when taking his forces to the conflict that would become the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. Several years later, [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] plan to sail through it all the way to [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]], but their ship is destroyed before reaching it. After the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], it and the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] often clash over either Ocean of Origins or [[Endless Ocean\|Endless Ocean]].
