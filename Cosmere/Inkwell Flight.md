**Inkwell Flight** is one of two other cadet Flights training at the [[DDF\|DDF]] [[Flight School\|Flight School]] along side [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]]. By the time of this Flight's graduation they have lost their flightleader, though it is unclear as to how.
[[Drama\|Drama]] is a cadet in either Inkwell Flight or [[Firestorm Flight\|Firestorm Flight]]. If she is part of Inkwell Flight then only four members remain in her Flight in the time period just before graduation. If she is not, then there are only two members of Inkwell Flight at this point in time.
[[Remark\|Remark]] is also a cadet in either Inkwell Flight or Firestorm Flight.
[[Spensa\|Spensa]] and [[FM\|FM]] eat dinner with members of Inkwell and Firestorm Flight not long after [[Arturo\|Arturo]] is pulled from Flight School. During dinner, the three Flights discuss whether they would be combined into one larger Flight due to their reduced numbers and if so, which Flight name they would keep.
