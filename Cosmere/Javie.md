Professor **Javie** is an engineer and member of the [[Set\|Set]].

## History
Professor Javie made a study of engineering and taught somewhere, potentially [[Elendel University\|Elendel University]]. At some point he came into contact with the [[Set\|Set]], and joined their ranks. He traveled to the city of [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] in the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] to visit the Set compound that had been built around the wreck of *Brunstell*. Javie came to lead the team of engineers along with Lady [[Stansi\|Stansi]]. It was hoped that he and his team would be able to discern the means by which the ship flew and perhaps replicate it. He was given a tour of the ship along with Stanoux, Stansi, and two other scientists, by [[Irich\|Irich]]. Like the rest of the scienctists, he appeared concerned by Irich's talk of dominating the Basin. Irich assuaged his fears by assuring them that the technology was better off in their hands than those of Elendel and appealing to his sense of curiosity about what they could learn from the ship. He and the rest of the group began investigating their ship as Irich left them to deal with another matter.
