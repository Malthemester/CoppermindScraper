## Geography
Lossand is situated on the southern side of Dayside. Its borders form the shape of a wedge, stretching from [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]] in the north to the southern [[Border Ocean\|Border Ocean]] in the south. Lossand is bordered by uninhabited [[Deep sand\|deep sand]] to the east, the [[Kerla\|Kerla]] to the north, and [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]] to the west. The Ry'Do Ali River runs directly through the center of the nation and is joined by the Nor'Tallon River before emptying into the ocean.

### Cities
[[Kezare\|Kezare]], the capital, is located in the northern half of Lossand, where the Ry'Do Ali and Nor'tallon Rivers meet.
[[Lraezare\|Lraezare]] lies on the coast at the mouth of the Ry'Do Ali River.
## History
Relations between Lossand and Kerzta were often strained in the past, primarily due to religious rhetoric from the Kerztian clergy who claim that Lossand is a desert because it is cursed by the [[Sand Lord\|Sand Lord]]. The Kerztian priest [[DaiKeen\|DaiKeen]] is particularly opposed to Lossand's acceptance of [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]]. This left the two nations frequently in a state of war with one another.
Tensions were eased two hundred years ago when the high merchant was selected as the new king of Kerzta, but growing support behind Kerzta's high priest has cast doubt on the possibility of continued peace.

## Politics
Lossand is ruled by the [[Taishin\|Taishin]]--a council of the eight **Profession** heads, each representing a different sector of Lossand's economy. The eight Professions are established and regulated by the Taishin themselves, the head of each Profession being appointed in different ways. After most of the sand masters was massacred in the [[Kerla\|Kerla]], the other Taishin tried to disband the Diem, but in the end [[Kenton\|Kenton]] managed to save his Profession.
The eight professions are:
