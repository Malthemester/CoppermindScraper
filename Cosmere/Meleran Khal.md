## Appearance

## History
Meleran Khal was born the youngest son of Teshav and Khal sometime around 1144, after his brothers [[Halam\|Halam]] and [[Aratin\|Aratin]]. Little of his history is known, but it likely he accompanied the rest of his family in the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] and followed them to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
While King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] was infiltrating [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], he asked [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to use Lightweaving to disguise [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] as Meleran Khal multiple times, since the two have a similar height.
