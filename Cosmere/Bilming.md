## Geography
Bilming is located on a peninsula on the [[Sea of Yomend\|Sea of Yomend]]. A railway connects it to Elendel.

## Landmarks
Bilming maintains a large fleet of clipper ships and cargo ships in its "impressive" harbor, and it has recently added warships known as "[[Pewternaut\|Pewternauts]]" with armored hulls and gun turrets.
One of the [[Set\|Set's]] hidden training compounds is located in Bilming.

## History
Bilming was created as part of the reshaping of Scadrial during the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].

### Relationship with Elendel
Bilming's status as an alternative port to Elendel appears to have caused some friction between the two cities. Elendel's former governor, [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate]], once made hollow promises about raising tariffs on imports that come from Bilming. Lord [[Bastien Severington\|Bastien Severington]], the mayor of Bilming, invited a number of senators from Elendel to the introduction of the Pewternauts as a gesture of friendship, only to have a senator named [[Inis Julien\|Inis Julien]] publicly call them pointless "toys".
In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], [[Devlin Airs\|Devlin Airs]] spoke to [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] at [[Kelesina Shores's party\|Kelesina Shores's party]] and warned him that civil war was brewing. Wax listened to Lord Severington give an anti-Elendel speech at the party and realized that Bilming had enough power to spearhead a conflict.

## Trivia
It is presumably named after Brandon's editor, [[Joshua Bilmes\|Joshua Bilmes]].
