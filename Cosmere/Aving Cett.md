Lady **Aving Cett** is a member of [[House Cett\|House Cett]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is older and has gray hair that she wears in a bun. She owns expensive jewelry. She is presumably the matriarch or a high-ranking member of her house, as she is the primary host of a party thrown at Cett Mansion. Like most nobles, she is perplexed by [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] lack of decorum.

## History
During a party hosted by House Cett in 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Aving stumbled upon Waxillium on a balcony. Wax was an eligible bachelor, and Aving urged him to come inside, claiming that there were people who wanted to meet him. Wax promised that he would come inside momentarily, but instead used the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] to disappear from the party without informing anyone. Wax later agreed with [[Tillaume\|Tillaume]] that he needed to send a letter to Lady Cett apologizing for his early departure.
