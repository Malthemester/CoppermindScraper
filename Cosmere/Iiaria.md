**Iiaria** is a nation on the [[Darkside\|Darkside]] of the planet [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
Iiarians have dark brown skin, brown eyes, and dark hair. [[Baon\|Baon]], who hails from Iiaria, is not seen wearing dark glasses when he visits the [[Dayside\|Dayside]], unlike other Darksiders such as [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]] and [[Cynder\|Cynder]].
Khriss and Baon discuss [[Skathan\|Skathan]], the current monarch of the [[Dynasty\|Dynasty]]; it is implied that Skathan is from Iiaria and that Iiaria is part of the Dynasty. Skathan has several magical abilities, but they do not appear to be common to other Iiarians.

## Trivia
In *White Sand Volume 1*, Khriss mentions "Irarians" when describing the people living in [[Lonzare\|Lonzare]]. It is not clear if this is a separate nation or a typo.
