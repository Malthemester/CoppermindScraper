Lord **Gave Entrone** is an amateur archaeologist in [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. He bought a few of the coins recovered from the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship [[Brunstell\|Brunstell]].
He attends [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores']] [[Kelesina Shores' party\|party]] and [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Wax]] wants to avoid him since he once dated Gave's cousin, [[Valette Entrone\|Valette Entrone]], but [[Steris\|Steris]] points out that he's one of their best options to talk to, since Wax has had some dealings in textiles with him and he was on a list of people possibly connected to the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] in [[ReLuur\|ReLuur's]] notebook. When Wax begins asking him about archaeology, he began insulting Wax to provoke a reaction and get an excuse to leave the conversation. After that didn't work, he instead insulted Steris, which caused Wax to snap in anger and instinctively reach for his gun.
