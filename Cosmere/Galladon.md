**Galladon** is an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He is originally a farmer from [[Duladel\|Duladel]]. His father was also an Elantrian and most of Galladon's knowledge of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] comes from spending time with his father in the city when he was a child. He is instrumental in creating the New Elantris settlement and fixing [[AonDor\|AonDor]]. He later joins the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]] and is seen on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
>‚Äú*You optimists just can't understand that a depressed person doesn‚Äôt want you to try and cheer them up. It makes us sick.*‚Äù
\-Galladon to Raoden[3]


After the Shaod is completed, he has dark metallic silver skin. He is bald. He has a tall and firm frame, wide hands and keen eyes.
Galladon is a pragmatic, often pessimistic man.

## Attributes and Abilities
Galladon is a skilled farmer and takes joy in farming. When the Shoad took Galladon, his transformation was initially incomplete, leaving his body unable to heal. After Elantris was restored his transformation was completed. Now his body heals quickly. As an Elantrian, Galladon is a practitioner of AonDor. Whether or not he has found out how to adapt AonDor for use on other [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]] is currently unknown. He is also a worldhopper, and is likely skilled in this regard as he was able to survive the Selish Cognitive Realm. He can appear off-world looking like a typical Duladen man, not like either an Elantrian with glowing skin nor one withered and weakened like some other Elantrian worldhoppers. Due to his young appearance, Galladon is making use of an unknown technique that slows his aging drastically.

## History
### Early Life
Galladon's father became an Elantrian while Galladon was still very young. Although at that time Elantrians were not required to move to Elantris, it was standard practice for them to live in Elantris to avoid persecution. Galladon lived with his mother and father in Elantris for several years, until his mother died. Following her death, Galladon's father became more and more withdrawn, until he finally died as a result of a heart condition. It was medically treatable, but he chose to let his life end rather than continue without his wife.
After his mother's death, Galladon returned to Duladel to become a farmer, with his father's blessing.

### Farm life
Galladon was determined to adapt to normal life upon leaving Elantris. Following his father's footsteps, Galladon took up farming, initially farming grain. He built his house with his own hands. After several years, he switched to orchards, preferring a crop that did not require planting every year. He continued his tradition of scholarship, reading during the off-season. Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, Galladon never really fit in with his neighbors, and so was able to leave his life with relatively few regrets when the Shaod took him.

### Elantrian
A few months after he was taken by the Shaod, Galladon met [[Raoden\|Raoden]] while he was running away from five other Elantrians on the latter's first day in Elantris. He started introducing Raoden to the realities of Elantris, telling him they were already dead, that their bodies no longer healed, and that the pain eventually drove every Elantrian mad. Raoden offered some of the food he was given to Galladon in exchange for educating and guiding him for thirty days. Galladon reluctantly agreed. He started teaching Raoden by showing him how the gangs in Elantris worked and how to keep his body from harm as much as possible. He also talked of the [[Hoed\|Hoed]] and showed Raoden the market section, the university, and the palace of Elantris where the three gangs made their homes. He told Raoden that when a [[Seon\|seon's]] master was taken by the Shaod, the seon was driven mad. After that, he took them to his father's workroom and introduced Raoden to [[AonDor\|AonDor]] by drawing Aon Deo in the air. They started discussing AonDor.
They saw the [[Derethi\|Derethi]] [[Gyorn\|gyorn]] [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] preaching on the walls of Elantris. Later, they went to the gates and, despite Galladon's protests, Raoden rescued a man named [[Mareshe\|Mareshe]] from the gangs and recruited him. They ran from [[Shaor\|Shaor's]] men to a building with an unstable staircase. The staircase collapsed, and Raoden threw the newcomer's food to the men below in the hopes that the men would leave. They learned that Mareshe was a jeweler, but Raoden asked him to make shoes. Mareshe agreed, and they start the foundation of New Elantris. This, however, made the gangs think Raoden was starting his own gang.
They continued recruiting and selected a [[Korathi\|Korathi]] church as their base. They moved Galladon's father's books to this base, though it took an hour for Raoden to convince Galladon to do so. Soon the Elantrians started coming to New Elantris by themselves and asking to join. Then Karata showed up with her gang, planning to end Raoden's new faction before it could become a threat. Raoden, however, managed to convince her to leave them be.
Galladon eventually learned there had been a rebellion in his homeland which resulted in the republic collapsing and that [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] was the state religion in Duladel. He was deeply shaken by the news. Raoden showed Galladon bags of seed corn and asked how he would judge the quality of the seeds. Galladon found them satisfactory, and soon he planted the corn in one of the gardens and started growing food.
Galladon was instrumental in Raoden's efforts to establish order in New Elantris. He explained the concept of the [[Dor\|Dor]] to Raoden. He was also the one who taught the other Elantrians how to draw AonDor. He played a large part in the battle for Teod, organizing and leading the Elantrians who came to Teod's rescue.

### Appearance on Roshar
Galladon appears on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. [[Purelake\|Purelake]] fisherman [[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] calls him **Grump**. How he is able to move between worlds is unknown. He is described as being dark-skinned, like the [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] of Roshar. Unlike the Makabaki, he has thick limbs and a completely bald head. This is very similar to how he is described before the Shaod. Since *The Way of Kings* takes place after *Elantris*, it is reasonable to conclude that this is an illusion, either identical or similar to his pre-Elantrian state. Much like in *Elantris*, he continues to refer to others as "friend", and frequently followed statements with the interrogative "Understand?". Galladon says these in the local language rather than his native [[Duladel\|Duladel]] language. At the end of the Interlude, he says a phrase in Duladen, his native language, repeating the word *kayana*, meaning "crazy". Galladon's true motives on Roshar are unknown, but he and his two companions, [[Demoux\|Demoux]] and [[Baon\|Baon]], hired Ishikk to look for [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. Ishikk was paid with a pouch of spheres even though he wasn't able to locate Hoid in the five months since the trio hired him. Two years later, the group had given up on finding Hoid and left Roshar.
