## Appearance and Personality
Essu is tall, with a long face and red-orange hair worn in a top knot. During the singer invasion of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], she wears a femalen body. Her skin is marbled white and red, and has a pattern similar to that of her mother's.
Essu suffers from severe cognitive impairment, as her mind has been broken by the unending cycle of death and rebirth that the Fused experienced during the [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. Her head flops from side to side, and she often stares off glassy-eyed or giggles to herself; she is one of the most unhinged Fused that [[Navani\|Navani]] has encountered. She does not have any physical impairments, but she has a tendency to drool; she has an attendant who dabs it away for her. Essu often follows and even mimics her mother, Raboniel. She is capable of speaking and sometimes asks for her mother, but she does not recognize her. She somehow knows a tune usually sung by humans in taverns, and is able to hum it.

## Attributes and Abilities
Although Essu is insane, she retains the inherent powers of a Fused. She is able to possess a new [[Singer\|singer]] body during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], and she cannot be killed by normal means. Navani believes that Essu is the same brand of Fused as Raboniel, a *fannahn-im*.

## History
At some point during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]] when Fused were regularly killed and reborn, Essu went insane. Her mother, Raboniel, had hoped that a mother and daughter serving together would preserve their sanity, but was proven incorrect. After the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]], she was trapped on [[Braize\|Braize]] for millenia with the rest of the Fused, and finally returned to [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. A singer family "donated" a body for her to use.
On Roshar, Essu was in the care of her mother and joined her when she led the singer invasion of Urithiru. After Raboniel captured Navani and put her to work researching [[Lights\|Lights]], Essu was often in the room. She did not pose a danger to Navani, who was mostly confused by her presence. Raboniel later revealed to Navani that Essu was her daughter.
Essu suffered minor injuries when Raboniel caused an explosion by attempting to mix [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] and [[Anti-Voidlight\|Anti-Voidlight]] using a [[Raysium\|raysium]] dagger. Essu did not seem to notice the explosion. Raboniel immediately constructed another dagger and used Anti-Voidlight to permanently kill Essu; her death was quick, but painful. As Raboniel wept over Essu's corpse, Navani realized that one of Raboniel's primary motivations for her research was to discover a way to free her daughter from the endless cycle of rebirth. Raboniel confirmed that Essu was permanently gone, having consulted with the souls on [[Braize\|Braize]].
After her death, Essu's body was burned and the ashes were returned to the family of the singer that she inhabited.
