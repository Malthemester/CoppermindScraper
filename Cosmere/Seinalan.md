## Appearance and Personality
He is a tall man, with long golden hair and has delicate features. He is around forty years of age.

## History
Shortly after [[Iadon\|Iadon]] became King of [[Arelon\|Arelon]] he met with Seinalan, giving him a royal decree that restructured Arelon's inheritance laws to be read at Iadon's funeral or fifteen years after it was created. Presumably Iadon gave it to Seinalan because, as Patriarch, his word is absolute. Not even [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]], a Derethi gyorn, would question it.
He is present at the wedding of Princess [[Sarene\|Sarene]] and Duke [[Roial\|Roial]], although he is displeased at not being asked to preside over it. He does however preside over the crowning of [[Raoden\|Raoden]], though is so shocked when Raoden's disguise falls that Sarene has to complete the ceremony.

## Patriarch
As Patriarch, Seinalan is the head of the Korathi Church. His selection is prompted by [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]] becoming [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]], the leaders of Shu-Korath felt they needed a leader just as young, regardless of his suitability for the position.
