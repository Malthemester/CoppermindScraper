**Kiin** is a [[Teo\|Teo]] sailor and merchant on [[Sel\|Sel]]. His name is based on Aon Kii, meaning "justice." Kiin is [[Sarene\|Sarene's]] uncle and the rightful king of Teod. He is also known by the name **Dreok Crushthroat** from his time as a pirate, though he meant for the name to be **Crushedthroat** for his scratchy voice.

## Attributes and Abilities
Kiin is extremely skilled with his axe--sufficiently so to kill a monk of [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]].
He is an extremely skilled cook, able to make cuisine of many countries. The fact that he cooks for his family is abnormal in [[Arelon\|Arelon]], where nobility usually hire cooks to do the job. He fears servants due to the revolution started primarily by servants during the [[Reod\|Reod]].

## History
 by  botanicaxu  Kiin's children
Kiin was the older brother of [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]] and rightful king of [[Teod\|Teod]]. He should have inherited the throne, but he wasted his youth on pleasure voyages and exploration, visiting foreign ports while his little brother stayed behind and helped rule the kingdom. Their father was ailing, and often Eventeo would have to hold court for him and attend the other tasks of king.
Some minor crisis arrived at the same time as their father died, and Eventeo--thinking his brother unworthy of the throne--eased into the role of king and was crowned before Kiin. Eventeo dealt with the problems of state, and generally was a good king. When Kiin got back from his latest trip, however, he was furious to find that his crown had been stolen from him. He demanded it back, but Eventeo refused and had Kiin banished.
Kiin was popular with the military men, however, because of the heroic figure he cut. He was the adventuring sailor, while Eventeo was a scholarly bureaucrat. Over the next few years, Kiin managed to gather a naval force from pirates, deserters from Eventeo's armies, and mercenary forces. It was during this time he nearly died to the accident that crushed his throat. He took the name "Dreok," after Aon Reo("punishment."), and sailed against Teod, trying to take the throne by force. He fought with an axe transcribed with the Aon Reo.
Eventeo won the battle, though only barely. Kiin barely escaped with his life, and went to Arelon to recoup and plan his next invasion. However, he fell in love with Daora, and slowly began to loose his hard edge. He and [[Daora\|Daora]] sired two children, [[Kaise\|Kaise]] and [[Daorn\|Daorn]]. He acted as a father to Daora's other two children from a different marriage, [[Lukel\|Lukel]] and [[Adien\|Adien]]. Kiin became a merchant and using his experience from his travels, Kiin was very successful.
Kaise was borne around the time of the [[Reod\|Reod]]. Daora and Kiin were horrified by the violent servant uprising in the Reod, and never hired servants again. As Kiin was very rich, he was offered a title by Iadon multiple times, but he always refused it. Daorn was born about two years after the Reod. Three years later, Adien was taken by the Shaod. Unwilling to have him thrown into the city, the family concealed Adien's condition with makeup and kept him close to home.
When Sarene was a little girl, she couldn't pronounce "Uncle Kiin," and nicknamed him "Hunkey Kay."
When Sarene arrived in Arleon, Kiin went to welcome her and invited her to eat at his house. He introduced her to his children and suggested that Sarene stay in his house, which she declined. Kiin and Lukel explained the political situation to Sarene and introduced her to the other members of Raoden's resistance group.
