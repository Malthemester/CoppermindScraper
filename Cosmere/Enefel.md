An **Enefel** is an Elantrian term for a trickster or joker, as well as a group of the same name. The term is derived from Aon Ene, meaning "wit", or "cleverness." Literally, Enefel means "Wit Killers," or "those who kill with wit." The term was most commonly used a few hundred years before the [[Reod\|Reod]], and isn't in common use by the time of the restoration of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]].

## History
During the Middle Era, when [[Arelon\|Arelon]] was beginning to form, a group of storytellers took on the name Enefel. They tell stories about the marvels of Elantris and its inhabitants to the common people. It is rumored that they are agents of the Elantrians, trying to reverse negative opinions that some people in rural areas had about the Elantrians, who distrust the Elantrians and their magic. The guild changed over the years, beginning to simply collect stories from various peoples and recording them. By the end of the Late Era, (200 years before the fall of Elantris) the guild had changed into various groups of scholars and philosophers. Aon Ene changed to represent more general scholarly intelligence and study, not just wit. Not all of the members of the Enefel remembered the original meaning of their group’s name, but some scholars did. Some of those scholars find the transformation of Enefel’s name to be some kind of joke played by history itself.
