He regularly attended balls in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] and danced with [[Valette Renoux\|Valette Renoux]] on several occasions. When Valette approached him at the last ball at [[Keep Venture\|Keep Venture]], he and the group of people standing with him (including [[Yestal\|Yestal]] and [[Triss\|Triss]]) snubbed her and walked away.

Valette realized that Idren and the rest of the nobles were trying to consolidate power while they could, and were only speaking with their close allies.
