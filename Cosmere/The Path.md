## Practices
Pathians meditate for 15 minutes daily, and there is no specific prescribed posture for meditation. During this meditation, Pathians wear a single earring. If this earring is a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, it would allow occasional communication between Harmony and the Pathian.
The Path is to study the beliefs of 300 ancient religions detailed in the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]] and learn from their moral codes.
Doing good is worship in and of itself.
The Path has no formal clergy, however there are Pathian missionaries, whose function it is to provide direction and explanation about the Path.
Pathian structures are small. They are known as sanctuaries, built to resemble the [[Terris\|Terris]] huts of old, typically containing only two chairs and a loft. One of the chairs is for the visitors to the sanctuary, the other ostensibly for Harmony. Eight sides of the sanctuaries are filled by large doorways, left open to allow the mists inside.
The Path teaches that the [[Mists\|mists]] are Harmony's body.
