**Flog** is one of [[Winsting Innate\|Winsting Innate's]] bodyguards in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
>“*He’s watching us. The mists are His eyes, my lord. Sure as Ruin, that is.*”
\-Flog[1]


Although Flog has never been outside of the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]], he wears a style of hat and duster commonly seen in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]. Unlike his employer, Flog believes that the [[Mist\|mists]] have supernatural properties and sometimes tries to avoid them. Flog is loyal and obedient, although this is partially due to to Winsting's [[Rioter\|Rioting]] abilities.

## History
Flog was present for [[Winsting Innate's auction\|Winsting Innate's auction]]; he was the presumptive leader of Winsting's security team. He was always at Winsting's side, and was described as an excellent bodyguard. He was charged with monitoring the guest list for the auction and checking into each person's background, due to the illicit activity that was going to occur. There was one guest at the party—a slender blond woman accompanying [[Dowser Maline\|Dowser Maline]]—that Winsting did not recognize, and Flog was baffled by her presence.
When gunfire suddenly erupted, Flog reacted quickly and led Winsting to his basement saferoom. Flog then went back upstairs to investigate. Winsting let him into the saferoom when he returned, and Flog reported that everyone was dead. As Winsting tried to figure out what to do next, his throat was slit and he died. Although Winsting did not see the assailant, Flog was the only other person in the room. [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]], a [[Kandra\|kandra]] who was the unknown guest, had killed Flog upstairs and shapeshifted into his form in order to gain access to Winsting.
