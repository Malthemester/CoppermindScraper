## Appearance and Personality
>“*"You're really gonna give me a pair of shoes," the urchin said. "For nothin’ ?" "Nothing but your story... Because, you and I are One."*”
\-Ym to an urchin boy[1]

He wears spectacles.
Ym is a kind and selfless man. Unlike some of his colleagues, he prefers to make the wooden forms of his shoes by himself. He thinks since it has been done that way for centuries, there is probably a good reason for it. He heals the urchins that come to his shop, comforts them and makes sure they have a good pair of shoes. He is religious and follows the Iriali god known as the One. His religious beliefs influence how he runs his business and as such he does not charge for the shoes he makes, instead asking for his customers to share their life experiences with him.

## Attributes and Abilities
Ym is a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] and has bonded a [[Mistspren\|mistspren]]. As such, he has access to the Surge of Progression and to the Surge of Illumination.
[[Wyndle\|Wyndle]] implied that the [[Cultivationspren\|cultivationspren]] considered bonding Ym, which would have allowed him access to the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Progression\|Progression]] and [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]].

## History
In his youth, he lived on the streets although he was apparently born to a family of means. He unwittingly killed a woman. He was told to deliver a bottle of wine to a woman and that the vintage was a message she would recognize. The wine, however, was poisoned and the woman died. Regretful of his actions, Ym went on to live a life free of crime. Eventually, he opened up a cobbler shop where he would often make shoes for the street urchins.
He was killed by [[Nale\|Nale]] in his attempt of stopping the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] by killing Radiants.
