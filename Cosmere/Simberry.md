**Simberry** is a type of fruit that grows on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It has clear flesh and a rind that is presumably red in color.
Simberries can be made into a red jam. According to *Palates of Personality*, a liking for this jam indicates a spontaneous and impulsive nature as well as a love for the outdoors.
It can also be fermented into a sweet fruit wine. Unlike other fruit wines, simberry wine can be clear in color if the rinds are carefully removed.

## History
[[Kabsal\|Kabsal]] brought [[Shallan\|Shallan]] some simberry jam when she was studying at the [[Palanaeum\|Palanaeum]] in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. The jam was ostensibly a gift for [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], but Kabsal knew that jam was one of Shallan's favorite foods.
When Shallan infiltrated the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]], [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] offered her some simberry wine of an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] vintage from her collection. Shallan had not tried it before.
