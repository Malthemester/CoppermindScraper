\-Hrud[1]


**Hrud** is a member of [[Camon\|Camon's]] thieving crew in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is a flat-faced and quiet man.
Hrud was with the rest of the [[Camon's crew\|crew]] who told [[Vin\|Vin]] the story of the Survivor of Hathsin shortly before [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] arrived at their safe house. He distrusted [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], spreading rumors of his unnatural abilities. Hrud, [[Milev\|Milev]], and the rest of the group left, leaving Vin behind to attend the meeting with Kelsier's crew.
