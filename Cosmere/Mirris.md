## Appearance and Personality
Mirris is about three fists tall, like most Aviar. She has subdued white and green plumage, and [[Sixth of the Dusk\|Sixth of the Dusk]] refers to her breed as a "streamer". Streamers are native to some islands of the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]], although [[Patji (island)\|Patji]] is not one of them. Mirris seems reserved towards strangers, and hisses at both Dusk and [[Kokerlii\|Kokerlii]]. Vathi sometimes comforts her by making clicking sounds.

## Attributes and Abilities
For more information, see [[Aviar\|Aviar]].
Mirris is Vathi's only Aviar and the two are bonded; Vathi is surprised to learn that a human can bond multiple Aviar. Like Kokerlii, Mirris's Aviar "talent" is the the ability to conceal mental activity in her immediate vicinity. This ability allows Vathi to evade the many predators on Patji that hunt by sensing thoughts. It is likely that Mirris would also be able to conceal the use of some forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Her wings are not clipped.

## History
Vathi worked for the [[Northern Interests Trading Company\|Northern Interests Trading Company]] and brought Mirris with her on an expedition to Patji. The two joined a scout team searching for a site to place a fortress, but despite Mirris's presence, a [[Deepwalker\|deepwalker]] destroyed the rest of the team. Vathi subsequently decided that she must find a [[Trapper\|trapper]] to have any chance of survival and she and Mirris headed into the jungle. Mirris was injured when she and Vathi fell after a "monster" attacked them; Vathi ended up caught in a [[Jellywire\|jellywire]] net. Dusk found them and was pleased to note that Vathi knew how to apply some first aid to Mirris. However, Dusk believed that Mirris's wing was broken and brought the pair back to his safecamp, where he cleaned Mirris's wound, wrapped her wings to prevent flight, and placed her with his other Aviar to calm her down. Because of her injury, Mirris remained in the safecamp when Dusk and Vathi left in order to investigate the Company's activities.
