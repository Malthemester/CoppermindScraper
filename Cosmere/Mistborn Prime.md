**Mistborn Prime** is the eleventh novel written by [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]].
[[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] was originally a part of *Mistborn* Prime, although only [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] were included. [[Misting\|Mistings]], as a concept, were only created when Allomancy was added to *Mistborn: The Final Empire*. Another element that was added was emotional Allomancy, [[Zinc\|zinc]] and [[Bronze\|bronze]].
[[Mistwraith\|Mistwraiths]] also originally appeared here, where they play a more prominent role. They are more of a threat than the scavengers they become in the published works, and the hero fights one.
[[OreSeur\|OreSeur]] orginated here and was the only character from this novel to make the move into The Final Empire.
