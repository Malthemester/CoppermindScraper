**RayZed** is a young pirate in the [[Belt\|belt]] of the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]], and a member of the [[Broadsider Faction\|Broadsider Faction]].

## History
RayZed worked at the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] base of [[Surehold\|Surehold]], and defected alongside [[Peg\|Peg]] and several others. She became a pilot, flying in one of the flights. RayZed went to the arena duel between [[Spensa Nightshade\|Spensa]] and [[Hesho\|Darkshadow]], and afterward joined in the celebrations back at the Broadsider base. She ate some real food during the celebration, an old memory of life outside of the nowhere. Before the joint pirate attack on [[Surehold\|Surehold]], RayZed took Chet out flying for some g-force training, building up his endurance so he could fly with Spensa into battle. When a delver-controlled fragment flew on a collision course to strike the Broadsider Base, RayZed was curious about the anomaly, asking questions of Peg to try and find out more. Afterward, RayZed presumably participated in the assault on Surehold, and moved into the facility with the rest of the faction.
