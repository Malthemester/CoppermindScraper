**William Muns** is a [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatist]] fighting at the [[Tower of Nebrask\|Tower of Nebrask]].
William is [[Melody Muns\|Melody's]] brother. They come from the Floridian Atolls where their parents still live. Both parents as well as William's and Melody's siblings are Rithmatists, which seemed to be nearly impossible.
He was believed to have died fighting the wild chalklings when he crossed the defensive lines at Nebrask. Professor [[Andrew Nalizar\|Nalizar]] and some other Rithmatists tried to rescue him after they saw William swarmed by wild chalklings, but failed and never found his corpse.
He was actually consumed by the [[Scribbler\|Scribbler]] and later released after it was defeated by [[Fitch\|Fitch]], [[Joel\|Joel]], and [[Melody\|Melody]].
