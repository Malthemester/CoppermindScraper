**Cressa** is a refugee on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is the niece of an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] man named [[Noril\|Noril]].
She was one of the many refugees in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] that were affected by a mild sickness that spread through the tower in 1175. While [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was treating her cough, she mentioned that she could not find her uncle, [[Noril\|Noril]]. She wondered if Kaladin had seen him, as he may have arrived in [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] shortly before its evacuation by the *Fourth Bridge*. Her plight stuck in Kaladin's mind, and [[Teft\|Teft]] agreed to help him look for Noril.
[[Lirin\|Lirin]] actually remembered seeing Cressa's uncle in Hearthstone, and the two [[Windrunner\|Windrunners]] eventually found Noril in a ward where [[Ardent\|ardents]] of the [[Devotary of Mercy\|Devotary of Mercy]] kept people who were suffering from mental ailments. Kaladin told Noril that Cressa was looking for him; Noril, who was distressed due to inadequate treatment by the ardents, wanted her to think that he was dead. After Kaladin removed him from the situation, Noril felt better and asked how Cressa was doing.
