**Hanavanar** is the king of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. He is assassinated by [[Szeth\|Szeth]] on the orders of King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] in order to cause political instability.
Hanavanar is on good enough terms with the rulers of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] that [[Balat\|Balat]] believes that discovery of [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] theft of [[Jasnah\|Jasnah's]] [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] would cause Hanavanar to turn [[House Davar\|House Davar]] over to the Alethi for execution. However, he and most other Vedens hold a personal grudge against [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]].

## Appearance and Personality
Hanavanar has a square brown beard and a prominent nose. A thick man, he has a wide waist and shoulders.
Hanavanar is a rather clever man, smart enough to realize that he could be a potential target for Szeth and wily enough to keep his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] a secret. However, he severely underestimates Szeth's abilities to the point of arrogance, even after hearing of his other kills. Hanavanar also seems not to value the lives of his subjects and peers above his own; he sets a trap for an assassin known for committing massacres during a dinner party. He is also somewhat paranoid.

## History
King Hanavanar spent years of his reign setting his highprinces against each other. He bonded a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] secretly at some point, and although he never admitted to it, some rumors of his Blade leaked out. When his highprinces began dying at [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] hands, he realized he might be the assassin's next target and devised a trap for him at one of his feasts.
During the feast, Hanavanar hid two [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]] under his table, counting on them plus his own Blade to be enough to defeat Szeth. He also outfitted dozens of his soldiers with [[Half-shard\|half-shards]], but Szeth forewent his [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] for a while and used the martial art of [[Kammar\|kammar]] to incapacitate the soldiers in various ways. Hanavanar dodged a table knife that was [[Lashing\|Lashed]] towards him, then stood his ground behind his Shardbearers. He finally ran from Szeth after his Shardbearers fell, but Szeth pursued him, beat down his [[Half-shard\|half-shard]] shield, and killed him.
Following King Hanavanar's death, the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] began fighting a succession war until [[Valam\|Valam]] took the throne. His death also inadvertently contributed to the formation of the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] with [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], who was willing to work with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], as Jah Keved's king.
