## Geography and Ecology
It borders [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]], [[Triax\|Triax]], [[Emul\|Emul]], and [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]]. It is on the edge of the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]].
The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] shows [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] the area around Tu Fallia and [[Triax\|Triax]] in a vision. Dalinar has little experience with Tu Fallia, and describes lush valleys with flora and fauna that look alien to him.

## History
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Tu Fallia was a part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]].
[[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] has an underground system of caverns, and there is a stream that leads to an exit in the mountain foothills of Tu Fallia after several days' march. [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] was suspected to have fled through this exit after her confrontation with [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]].

## Politics
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] considers Tu Fallia a nomadic backwater similar to [[Hexi\|Hexi]]. It is only nominally a "nation" and it lacks any form of organized government, even compared to the loose tribal coalition of [[Marat\|Marat]].
