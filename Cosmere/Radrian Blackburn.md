## History
>“*For a man who’s abilities depended on seeing, he was remarkably short-sighted.*”
\-Grandpa Smedry[1]


He was employed by [[Shasta Smedry\|Shasta Smedry]] to make the [[Sands of Rashid\|Sands of Rashid]] into a [[Lens\|Lens]]. He captured the initial Leavenworth's infiltration team, though [[Sing Sing Smedry\|Sing]], [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz]], and [[Bastille\|Bastille]] escaped from their prison. He tried to get information out of [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Grandpa Smedry]] and [[Quentin Smedry\|Quentin]], but Grandpa Smedry arrived late to the torture and Quentin activated his talent so that he only spoke in gibberish. Alcatraz rescued them, and soon after Blackburn and Grandpa Smedry had an Oculator’s duel. They were both very skilled, but Blackburn was more skilled and defeated Leavenworth. Alcatraz tricked Blackburn by breaking his Firebringer’s Lens to shoot backwards. When Blackburn tried to use it, it fired backwards into his single remaining eye and blinded him. He was left behind by the Smedry’s as they escaped, leaving him powerless and defeated.
