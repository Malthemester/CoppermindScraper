**Darrelnai** was a location in the domain of King [[Wednegon\|Wednegon]], after the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]], and presumably prior to that in [[Classical Scadrial\|Classical Scadrial]]. It may have been the name of Wednegon's kingdom, or a city within it.
Prior to the Ascension, the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] hurt Darrelnai's food stores, which caused persistent issues after the Lord Ruler's rise. Wednegon blames this lack of food for why his soldiers could not fight off the koloss. It is said that Wednegon was the last leader to fight off the Lord Ruler in military combat, so it is not clear how long Darrelnai survived if the Deepness still affected it so long after the Ascension.
