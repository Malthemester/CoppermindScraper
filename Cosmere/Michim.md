**Michim** is a guessing game on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It involves betting numbers of colored stones.
[[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] and [[Teft\|Teft]] play it while waiting for [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to return from the Shattered Plains. Teft complains about Sigzil using the name 'michim' as it is a 'holy word' in [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], though Sigzil points out that the word is not holy where the game originated. Teft loses most of the time.
