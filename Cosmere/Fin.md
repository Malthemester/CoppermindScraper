**Fin** is a groom in the employ of King [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
He is around twelve years old. He is [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]], and has sandy hair with a few hints of black.
During the course of [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] investigation into the broken girth strap of Elhokar's saddle, he interviewed Fin. Fin told him that he personally put the king's favorite saddle on his horse, but he noticed that the saddle had been changed before the head grooms took the horse to the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] warcamp. Sadeas brought a very nervous Fin to one of the king's feasts to give his testimony. This proved to be a crucial piece of evidence proving Dalinar's innocence in the attempt on Elhokar's life.
