**Limmi** is the head of the ground-floor staff for [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
Lord [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] had Limmi draft a response to [[House Yomen\|House Yomen]] indicating that he and Lady [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] would be attending their [[Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner\|wedding reception]] but to wait to send it until he confirmed that she should. She tried to warn him that it was [[Wayne\|Wayne]] waiting in the sitting room and not the Harms family, but he walked in before she could tell him. Soon afterward, when [[Jackstom Harms\|Lord Harms]], Steris, and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] actually arrived, Limmi was unable to stop them from interrupting Wax and Wayne's conversation about the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]].
Later, while further investigating the Vanishers, Wax had Limmi bring him broadsheets from the [[Elendel Daily\|Elendel Daily]] covering recent events and the robberies in particular.
[[Tillaume\|Tillaume]], Wax's butler, knocked Limmi out prior to his assassination attempt on Wax. He hid her and [[Miss Grimes\|Miss Grimes]] in a closet, presumably to protect them from the potential explosion. After the explosion, Wax carried Limmi and Miss Grimes outside to the back garden, hoping the constables or [[Krent\|Krent]], his coachman, would find them.
