## Appearance
The *Weights and Measures* is a massive starship, bigger than the Superiority battleships stationed near [[Detritus\|Detritus]]. The ship has multiple ports along the sides for launching starfighters. It has knobs that look like gun emplacements, which leads [[Spensa Nightshade\|Spensa Nightshade]] to realize that it is in fact a military ship that the Superiority doesn't want to publicly acknowledge as such.

## History
The *Weights and Measures* functions as a transport ship that carries pilots of the Delver Resistance Program from the docks at [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]] to the [[Delver\|delver]] maze lightyears away. It is later used as a battleship for the assault [[Detritus\|Detritus]] as part of [[Winzik\|Winzik's]] coup.

## Functions
The *Weights and Measures* has an engine room that contains a [[Cytonics\|cytonic]] [[Taynix\|hyperdrive]], a command room, ballrooms suitable for hosting parties, restrooms, docks for starfighters, and rooms for passengers to sit while undergoing hyperjumps. It also has its own artificial gravity that engages as soon as a ship enters one of its ports, as well as invisible shields that hold in atmosphere but let fighters through. Its bays have room for several hundred fighters.
The ship has a full complement of guards in multiple species, including [[Dione\|diones]] and [[Varvax\|varvax]]. These guards make up a portion of the 50-60 crew members responsible for all the ship's functions. Security on the *Weights and Measures* is tight: it is equipped with a communications shield that prevents unauthorized external communications, and passengers without sufficient security access must be accompanied by a security drone.
