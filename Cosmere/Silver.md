## Uses
### Threnody
Silver is a significant substance and a valuable currency in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]], as it is known to repel [[Shade\|shades]]. Shades that touch it are thrown backward, though the touch of the spirits blacken and ruin the metal. A ring of silver is installed around every house to ward off the shades, and the ring needs to be maintained regularly.
Silver can also heal the effects of a shade attack. Silver dust is applied immediately to areas of the body that are affected, reversing the necrotic effects of the shade's touch. Applying silver too late would have no effect on the wound.


Silvery chains that originate on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] somehow allow a user to "anchor" themselves through a [[Cognitive anomaly\|Cognitive anomaly]]. The implications of anchoring are unknown, but the chains are incredibly rare and valuable on other planets. They are used by the scholars of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]].
The chains are described as "silver" or "silvery", but their exact composition is unclear. [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] was immediately shocked at the sight of a Threnodite chain on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] while [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] failed to notice anything unusual about a chain that he saw in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], implying that the chains have distinguishing characteristics that are not obvious to every observer.

### Scadrial and Other Planets
Silver is [[Allomancy\|Allomantically]] inert. It may have interesting properties, but on Scadrial they are largely undiscovered. Like all metals other than [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] (and certain aluminum alloys), it can be used as an anchor by [[Coinshot\|Coinshots]] and [[Lurcher\|Lurchers]].
On planets where silver is not known to exhibit special properties (such as Scadrial, Roshar, and [[Sel\|Sel]]), it is typically used as jewelry or decoration.

## Trivia
Brandon originally envisioned the Allomantic partner of [[Pewter\|pewter]] as silver instead of [[Tin\|tin]], changing his mind after learning that he was under the false impression that pewter had a high quantity of silver. Even years later, he sometimes forgets that silver was replaced with tin.
Because silver is such a well-known metal in real life, Brandon still wanted to include it in the Allomantic table. He considered swapping it in for aluminum as the metal that wipes out other metal reserves in chapter 36 of *The Final Empire*, when [[Vin\|Vin]] is captured in [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]]. However, he decided that silver was too abundant to have this effect. He has some regrets about leaving silver out of Allomancy, but the fact that aluminum goes from very rare to very common after a society becomes industrialized lends itself well to the long-term arc of *Mistborn*.
After replacing silver with tin, Brandon was concerned that the description of [[Vin\|Vin's]] earring might be confusing, so it became 'silver coated'.
[[Nightblood\|Nightblood's]] sheath is described as "silver" in *Warbreaker*, but it is actually made of [[Aluminum\|aluminum]].
