**Alds** is a resident of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
Alds, along with [[Milp\|Milp]] and several other townsmen, accompanied Citylord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] and his son [[Rillir\|Rillir]] on a [[Whitespine\|whitespine]] hunt around the year 1168. The party was ambushed by several whitespines and Alds was badly wounded. Alds and Milp, who had also been injured, were left behind by the hunting party on the orders of Roshone so that they could hurry to bring the mortally injured Rillir to [[Lirin\|Lirin]] for treatment. Afterwards, more men from the townsmen returned to try to save Alds and Milp. It is unknown Alds survived, as the whitespines were still in the area and his wounds were severe. Lirin told his son [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to get some rest in case he needed help treating Alds and Milp later.

## Trivia
Chapter 41 of the Way of Kings is entitled, "Of Alds and Milp".
