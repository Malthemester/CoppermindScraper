The **Atad Mountains**, known to the [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] as the **Dathreki Mountains**, comprise a mountain range on the continent of [[Opelon\|Opelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].
The mountains lie along the border of [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and Fjorden. For many years, the [[Derethi\|Derethi]] were unable to invade Arelon due to the natural barrier afforded by the mountains, contributing to their hatred of the Arelene.
The range is considered a major geographical feature of Arelon; the curvature of the mountains is mirrored in the right side of Aon Aon, the basic symbol of [[AonDor\|AonDor]].
[[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Devotion's Perpendicularity]] is located in the northern end of the mountains, near [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] and [[Kae\|Kae]].
