>‚Äú* Word has come in to all the warcamps from Highprince Sebarial. They found something out there, on the Plains. Be ready. Just in case... First that highstorm nobody knew about, then the rains stop early, then the storming king man of Alethkar on my doorstep. Now this. I think we might be abandoning camp, even though nightfall‚Äôs around the corner.*‚Äù
\- Chilinko to Lopen about the potential abandonment of Little Herdaz[1]


**Little Herdaz** is a district within the [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Many of the [[Herdazian\|Herdazians]] in the warcamps live there, among them [[Lopen\|Lopen's]] family, including his mother, his uncle and several of his cousins.
The buildings there are mostly hovels. Though nominally, Little Herdaz is under Sebarial's rule, the locals do not consider this particularly important, and police themselves. This self-seclusion is what leads Lopen and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to hide king [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] there following [[Graves\|Graves's]] assassination attempt.
It's uncertain what happened to Little Herdaz following the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. Though Sebarial's warcamp survived the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] without much damage, owning to the protection of the half-ruined dome it'd been built in, most of his people relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with their [[Highprince\|highprince]]. As shortly after the battle, [[Chilinko\|Chilinko]] speculated that the district might get an order to move soon, it is possible the people of Little Herdaz are now in Urithiru.

## Trivia
The name "Little Herdaz" is likely derived from many similar neighborhoods in real life, such as  in Dallas or Little Poland in .
