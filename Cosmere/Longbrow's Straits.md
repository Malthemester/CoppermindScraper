**Longbrow's Straits** is a waterway that separates the island of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] from the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] on mainland [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The straits are likely named for the famous sailor [[Longbrow\|Longbrow]].
The straits are lined by tall, sleek lighthouses for navigation. Various creatures live in the water, including [[Santhid\|santhidyn]], [[Khornak\|khornaks]], [[Redwater\|redwaters]], and schools of small fish. The straits become narrow near [[Klna City\|Klna City]], but in some areas they are wide enough that it can be difficult to see land.

## History
In 1173, the *Wind's Pleasure* traveled the straits, taking [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] on their journey from [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. The seas were relatively calm at the time, but [[Tozbek\|Tozbek]] implied that sailing the straits could sometimes be difficult. Shallan noted the dark appearance of the distant Frostlands and the cliffs visible on Thaylenah. She sighted a rare santhid and ordered the crew to lower her into the water so that she could sketch it.

### In Shadesmar
Longbrow's Straits corresponds to a landmass in the Rosharan [[Subastral\|subastral]] ([[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]). It is located at the south end of the [[Sea of Lost Lights\|Sea of Lost Lights]] and it borders the [[Glasswater Deep\|Glasswater Deep]] and the [[Luminous Shallows\|Luminous Shallows]]. It contains the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] version of [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] and a small lake that is hated by [[Nazh\|Nazh]].
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and his companions were trapped in Shadesmar in 1174, Kaladin realized that the *Honor's Path* would sail relatively close to Longbrow's Straits, and he hoped to reach the landmass there to try and seek out the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] in Thaylen City. They eventually sighted Longbrow's Straits, and Kaladin flew the party onto the land, which contained a strange, empty glass forest. After a long journey through the forest, they reached Thaylen City, where the Oathgate was guarded by thousands of enemy [[Spren\|spren]].
