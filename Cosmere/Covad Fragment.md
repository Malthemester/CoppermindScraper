>“* I've been translating what I can, but got stuck on the Covad Fragment. If what you’ve been doing here is correct, it might be because Covad isn’t true Dawnchant, but a phonetic transcription of another ancient language…*”
\- Urv[1]


The **Covad Fragment** is an old untranslated manuscript thought to be written in [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]].
After [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Navani\|Navani]] released information about how to translate Dawnchant, many scholars started working on it in earnest. [[Ellista\|Ellista]] proposed that some of the more challenging fragments were potentially not Dawnchant, but rather its script being used to phonetically transcribe other languages. Ardent [[Urv\|Urv]], who studied the Covad, decided that this was an example of such a fragment.
