**Deep sand** refers to areas on the Dayside of [[Taldain\|Taldain]] with particularly deep layers of sand.
Deep sand is considered very dangerous because it is frequently inhabited by [[Sandling\|sandlings]]. Areas of deep sand are also generally void of water because [[Dorim vine\|dorim vines]] are unable to grow. This extra space and lack of water is what allows sandlings to survive.
Northern Dayside consists mostly of deep sand.
Kerztians bury the bodies of their dead in deep sand.
