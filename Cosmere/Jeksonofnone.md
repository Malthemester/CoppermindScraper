## Appearance and Personality
Jeksonofnone is about two fists tall with sleek green plumage. He stays on a perch in his cage using his clawed feet. He exhibits a noticeable personality as he studies people.

## Attributes and Abilities
Like all birds, he is referred to as a "chicken" by Rosharans outside of [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. The Shin name for his species is not known, but it lives throughout the region. Because his species is relatively intelligent and can be trained, it is not typically eaten as meat.

## History
Jeksonofnone was under the care of a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] man when [[Shallan\|Shallan]] saw him at the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]]. Shallan had never seen a similar "chicken", and was shocked when his owner had him speak his name on command, accusing him of being a [[Voidbringer\|voidbringer]].

## Trivia
The name "Jeksonofnone" mimics the naming conventions used by humans in Shinovar. The name is likely a nod to "Jeksonsonvallano", the original name of [[Szeth\|Szeth]] in *The Way of Kings Prime*. Brandon liked the name Jek but had to change it to Szeth after modifying Shin linguistics.
Jeksonofnone's appearance is described similarly to some species of [[Aviar\|Aviar]], but he is not an Aviar.
