**Wyrn** is an ancient resident of [[Sel\|Sel]] who founded the nation of [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]]. Subsequent rulers of Fjorden have used "[[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]]" as a title.
He is the subject of the oldest known literary work on Sel, *Wyrn the King*. He lived long before the founding of [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]]. After Shu-Dereth was adopted as the state religion of Fjorden, modern Derethi priests altered historical documents to falsely claim that Wyrn was Derethi and worshipped [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]].
He is said to have wielded a sword named [[Gretgor\|Gretgor]]. A sword thought to be Gretgor is still extant and held in [[Widor\|Widor]].
