The **Midnight Essence** is a type of spren created by [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir, the Midnight Mother]]. The ancient [[Knights Radiant\|Radiants]] considered them one of the [[Ten Deaths\|Ten Deaths]]. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] experienced them in one of his visions, while [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]], and members of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] had to deal with them while fighting Re-Shephir in Urithiru.

## Appearance & Behavior
The Midnight Essence's skin is smooth, slick, black, and reflective. They could appear in a variety of shapes. In Dalinar's vision, they had six extremely thin legs that were bent at the sides with clawed paws. Their body seems almost fluid, with a long and flexible neck and sharp teeth that appeared like knives. They also give off a putrid smell. The Midnight Essence created by Re-Shephir in Urithiru were humanoid, mimicking the appearance of people in the tower. But they can also change shape at will, being able to squeeze themselves into a hole and wriggle away to escape pursuit.
The Midnight Essence in Dalinar's vision had no eyes. It hunted by smell, and made a soft wheezing whispering sound when hunting for a scent. Its body was soft, and gave a little when it was struck. When the skin was pierced, the Midnight Essence bled smoke. If the Essence was damaged enough, its entire body would deflate with a hissing sound, leaving behind a skin that looked like a sack of black silk. The Midnight Essence's mouth was a weak point on its body.
Midnight Essence can be fairly clever as well, wary when facing a skilled or determined opponent.

## Abilities
The claws of the Midnight Essence were powerful enough to seriously damage [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. It was quite strong, able to burst right through the wall of a barn. As it hunted by smell, it could track people in the darkest night. They also often hunted as a pack. The Essence was seemingly impervious to fire. They were also swift, both while running and while fighting. While the Midnight Essence may be released directly by Re-Shephir, it also may be extracted from her to be used independently and released elsewhere.
