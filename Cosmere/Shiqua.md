A **shiqua** is a garment worn by the [[Tashikk\|Tashikki]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Design
A shiqua is a long single sheet, wrapped around the entirety of the wearer's body from head to toe, winding around arms and legs individually, sometimes also being wrapped back around the waist as a skirt. The garment is worn by both men and women. The fabric used in a shiqua is usually a solid color such as yellow, black, or brown. To create the garment, the fabric must be draped and tied around the body in a distinctive way. Cloth wrapped around the body haphazardly will identify the wearer as a foreigner. [[Arclo\|Arclo]] has learned to correctly wrap a shiqua, as it helps him conceal his true form. [[Adolin\|Adolin]] noticed at least one [[Spren\|spren]] in [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] wearing a shiqua with trousers, an unusual combination.

## Cultural Significance
The shiqua has a religious purpose: to cover up the wearer's body from an entity named Nun Raylisi ([[Rayse\|Rayse]]), the enemy of the god [[Tashi\|Tashi]]. Tashikki people almost always wear the wraps, even in far-off lands such as [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. Within Tashikk, it is considered less necessary to fully cover the body, because it is believed that Tashi protects the residents there. People therefore sometimes adjust the shiqua to expose their head and face within their homeland; they may also pull up the shiqua to allow more movement in their legs. Some Tashikki do wear other types of clothing; the Tashikki ambassador to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] notably wore a flowery suit to the first meeting of the monarchs.
