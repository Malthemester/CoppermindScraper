## Appearance and Personality
Geormin is a nice enough fellow, who [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] knows tangentially. They drink together on occasion, although Geormin cheats at chards.

## History
Geormin was one of the earliest victims of [[Bloody Tan\|Bloody Tan]]. His disappearance was the one that started Wax on his hunt for Tan. About two months after his disappearance, Wax found Geormin's body in Tan's subterranean lair in [[Feltrel\|Feltrel]]. The man had been mummified in a grotesque display, hung from the ceiling, arms propped up, mouth pried open, and head cocked. Wax promised to cut his body down later.
