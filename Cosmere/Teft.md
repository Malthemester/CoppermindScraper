\-Teft[5]


Teft is a man in his fifties with tan skin, drooping cheeks, and no slave mark. He has brown eyes with an  and close-cropped, grizzled white-salted hair. He keeps a neat, short and square beard that is light brown mixed with patches of gray. Teft is often blunt and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone. He nurses a deep-seated grudge against [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] but is observant and gruffly thoughtful towards the other members of Bridge Four. He is also a natural leader and a loyal sergeant.
Teft has harbored a [[Firemoss\|firemoss]] addiction since his time in [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas']] army, which is a deep cause of personal shame and grief; during his many conversations with Kaladin, Teft repeatedly states that he isn't trustworthy. Even after bonding [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]], he harbors feelings of inadequacy and shame for a while, believing that he is incapable of upholding the ideals of a Radiant due his past actions. Phendorana eventually turns his perspective around, and he finds within himself a deep determination to struggle forward for the sake of those who love him even if he sometimes fails. He comes to enjoy the good parts of life despite all of the things that go wrong around him.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Surgebinding
As a Windrunner, Teft has the ability to manipulate the [[Surges\|Surges]] of [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]] and [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]] through his [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with his [[Honorspren\|honorspren]]. By breathing in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], he gains superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, stamina, and healing for the duration of his access to Stormlight. While his [[Phendorana\|honorspren]] is present with him, his movements are enhanced by her. This gives Teft a superior natural fighting talent, although it does not replace skill by itself. After Teft swears the Third Ideal of the Windrunners, his honorspren gains the ability to become a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. Unlike the dead Blades left after the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], he can summon it in the form of any weapon he chooses, including a shield, and transform it from one to another almost instantaneously.


Teft can manipulate the Surge of Adhesion, also known as the Full [[Lashing\|Lashing]], to bind objects or creatures together using Stormlight.


Teft can manipulate the Surge of Gravitation to change the direction and strength of an object's gravitational attraction. This enables him to achieve a form of flight.


As a Knight Radiant who has access to two Surges, Teft also has a [[Resonance\|resonance]]. Windrunners have an increased number of squires, more than any other order, as their resonance. Teft's squires include the entire crew of [[Bridge Thirteen\|Bridge Thirteen]].

## History
### Early Life
Teft was born in [[Talinar\|Talinar]] to a family of the sixth [[Nahn\|nahn]]. When he was a boy, a cult known as the [[Envisagers\|Envisagers]] introduced the people of Talinar to the idea of returning the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] by returning the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]. Envisagers also purposefully put their lives in danger, hoping that they would manifest [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] powers. Teft's family joined the Envisagers, and they brought him with them to their initiation. His parents taught Teft about their beliefs, giving him basic information on using [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and what the Radiants would be able to do with the power. Teft's mother later died in an attempt to bring out hidden Radiant powers. Teft reported the Envisagers to the citylord when he was eight years old, after which a trial was held for them; all of them were executed, including Teft's father, whom he watched being hanged.
At some point Teft got married, though when and to whom is not clear; his wife had already died by the time he was a [[Bridgeman\|bridgeman]].

### Bridge Four
 by  Elisgardor  Helping take care of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]
Eventually, Teft joined [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas']] army as a spearman. His squadmembers there convinced him to try [[Firemoss\|firemoss]], which began a life-long addiction. He became a sergeant and made his way to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], where he was sent to the [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]] as a punishment. After some other camp infraction, Teft was transferred to [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]], where [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] befriended him. He ended up in Kaladin's inner circle along with [[Rock\|Rock]], actively helping him in his plans.
Teft was the first to suspect Kaladin might be able to use [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. He confirmed this suspicion by (amongst other things) pushing a dun [[Spheres\|sphere]] into Kaladin's hand, claiming it to be "for luck," just before Kaladin was to be left outside alone to face "the judgement of the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]]" by way of the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]]. After the storm, the sphere in Kaladin's hand appeared to be dun, even though it should have been [[Infuse\|infused]] with light by the highstorm. Teft was almost certain that this meant Kaladin had the ability to use Stormlight. While Kaladin was recovering from his wounds and fever after the highstorm, Teft brought three small infused diamond spheres and pressed them into Kaladin's hand, waiting anxiously to see what would happen. When Teft had nearly lost hope of being right about the events and their meaning, Kaladin drew in a short powerful breath, infusing himself with Stormlight, and began to glow from the leaking Light. Teft, knowing there was a healing effect to Stormlight, repeated this treatment enough to save Kaladin's life but not enough to draw suspicion from the other bridgemen. Ten days after surviving the highstorm, Kaladin was well enough to get up.

>‚Äú*An empty sphere after a storm... And a man who's still alive when he should be dead. Two impossibilities.*‚Äù
\-Teft musing on Kaladin's survival[28]

These revelations sparked a heavy curiosity in Teft, and he began asking leading questions to see if Kaladin was willing to discuss his use of Stormlight, or if he was even aware of his abilities. At one point, Kaladin was handed a bag of infused spheres. Teft then threw a surprise punch at Kaladin, causing him to inhale reflexively; Kaladin noticed his familiar surge of strength and focus, and both Teft and [[Lopen\|Lopen]] noticed the soft glow coming from Kaladin's skin. After time passed and they were certain of Kaladin's abilities, Teft, Lopen, and [[Syl\|Syl]] worked with Kaladin to help him understand and trigger his newfound powers. Teft shared with Kaladin what he knew about the Radiants and their ways from his youth in the Envisagers. He was also the one to divulge the words of the First Ideal to Kaladin, who seemed almost (whether by instinct or experience is not clear) to understand the meaning and reasoning behind the words.
Kaladin discovered Teft had military experience and was a sergeant before becoming a bridgeman. He became invaluable to Kaladin's leadership by acting as sergeant to Kaladin's captain and by taking command when asked, when ordered, or during times when Kaladin was indisposed. His military experience was never divulged in great detail, as the history of bridgemen's personal lives seemed to be their most guarded secret, although it was sufficient to convince Kaladin that Teft was able to conduct the daily training in the chasms. Teft tried to convince Kaladin to join in, but he refused to hold a spear.
After the disaster of the side-carry that led to Kaladin being strung up in the highstorm, he devised a new way to protect Bridge Four: wearing armor made from the corpses of the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]], scavenged in the chasms, to draw the enemy's attention to himself. The first time he tried this, he gave Teft orders to lead the group on an escape attempt that night if his idea failed. Because the idea worked well, they bided their time until the [[Battle of the Tower\|assault on the Tower]] to attempt an escape. Teft was wounded on the initial approach, and after Kaladin patched him up, [[Rock\|Rock]] and [[Peet\|Peet]] helped him walk as they retreated with the rest of Sadeas' army. After Bridge Four abandoned their chance to escape by returning to the Tower in aid of [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] army, Teft was able to return the favor by pulling arrows out of Kaladin's arm and settling him in a safe place. He helped push the bridge into place, then took charge of the crew while a freshly healed Kaladin, who had just sworn the Second Ideal, went after Dalinar.
That evening, after Dalinar secured the lives of Sadeas' bridgemen, Teft spoke with the rest of Bridge Four about the Radiants and Kaladin's abilities.

### Dalinar's Honor Guard
 by  Steve Argyle  Teft and Bridge Four standing behind [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] as he trades [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)\|Oathbringer]] for them
After Dalinar traded [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)\|Oathbringer]] for the lives of Sadeas' bridgemen, Teft joined with the rest of Bridge Four as his personal guard. Kaladin created a command structure among the former bridge crews he was going to train into guards, making Teft a lieutenant and putting him in overall charge of training. He directed Teft to begin by organizing the bridgemen into groups of forty, then training two from each group to act as sergeants to the rest of their men. Not long after, Bridge Four went to get tattoos to cover up the slave brands that most of them had on their foreheads, and Teft got one too, despite the fact that he never had a slave brand. He was the first to speak up for [[Rlain\|Shen]] when the tattooist objected to serving him. As the group outfitted themselves in their new [[Cobalt Guard\|Cobalt Guard]] uniforms, Teft tried to talk Kaladin into showing Dalinar what he could do, but Kaladin refused outright. When the others cut the old guard's insignia out of the uniforms, Teft agreed with them that they weren't just replacements, they were their own crew: Bridge Four.
Teft had a difficult time getting anywhere at first with training the former bridgemen, prompting Kaladin, Rock, and Teft to take the group of trainees into the chasms; this helped the new recruits feel included and opened them up to show interest in the training. On one of the regular trips to the chasms they began making, Teft left the trainees under [[Drehy\|Drehy's]] direction and came to speak with Kaladin, who asked him more about the Radiants and observed that Teft became much more dour when speaking about his past.
As well as taking shifts guarding Dalinar and the King, Teft kept training the former bridgemen, sending daily reports to Kaladin and assessing when they were ready to begin patrolling the area outside of the warcamps. He went on a patrol with Kaladin and the group of forty, then disappeared right after; this was the first of many such disappearances. Kaladin confronted him about his disappearance when he came to initiate Bridge Seventeen in the chasms, but Teft made it clear he didn't want to talk about it. After the two got back to Bridge Four's fire that evening, Teft went out again with a small group from Bridge Four.
When Kaladin decided to take [[Zahel\|Zahel]] up on his offer to train him to fight with a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], he took Teft, [[Moash\|Moash]], and [[Yake\|Yake]] with him; they each handled a Blade and began training in the ten sword [[Stances\|stances]] with wooden models. During a break in training, Teft mentioned to Kaladin that the circumstances around [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] arrival looked suspicious, prompting Kaladin to investigate her further.
Some of the other members of Bridge Four wanted to break Kaladin out when [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] imprisoned him for asking a [[King's Boon\|King's Boon]], but Teft talked them out of it. He was with the crew when they witnessed Moash becoming a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]], then led them back to the barrack to allow Kaladin a moment alone with Moash.

>‚Äú*Well, Teft supposed that was all right, Dalinar not believing. He‚Äôd just be that much more surprised when Kaladin did return.*‚Äù
\-Teft, when Dalinar visits him on his vigil[22]

Teft and Bridge Four carried their old bridge out onto the Shattered Plains on the expedition to allow Shallan to see a [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]] chrysalis. After Kaladin and Shallan were lost into the chasms, Teft took shifts with the others watching for them, never doubting that they would return. On one of these watches he discussed his past among the Envisagers with [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] while they played [[Michim\|michim]]. For the duration of Kaladin's absence, the crew made Teft their leader and looked to him for daily assignments, though he managed to be on nearly every shift out by the chasms.

### Battle of Narak
Immediately after Kaladin and Shallan's return, Dalinar, [[Roion\|Roion]], [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]], and [[Aladar\|Aladar]] left on the expedition that culminated in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and the discovery of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Teft and most of Bridge Four went with them, though he decided to leave Moash behind to watch over King Elhokar. During the battle, Teft and the rest of Bridge Four kept close to Dalinar. After Kaladin defeated Elhokar's assassins, he flew out to the army on the plains, saving Dalinar from [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] Lashing and encountering Bridge Four, who gave him infused gems to recharge his Stormlight at Teft's command. After Kaladin defeated the Assassin in White, he returned to the plateau where the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] was and found Teft and the rest of the crew looking for him. Teft told him that [[Rod\|Rod]] had died, then commented that he had noticed some of the men glowing faintly right before Kaladin had arrived on the plains; he had been listening to readings of some of Dalinar's visions and, based on that information, thought that they were becoming squires to Kaladin. The crew had had to abandon their bridge in the conflict, but a salvage team later found the old Bridge Four in a chasm near [[Narak\|Narak]]; at Teft's request, Dalinar had it hauled up, repaired, and put to use moving people between plateaus near the Oathgate.
Teft and the rest of the bridgemen took shifts scouting and exploring Urithiru. He was with some of Bridge Four when they discovered Sadeas' body in the tunnels of Urithiru, and he vehemently denied killing the man when a group of Sadeas' own soldiers finally found the scene, though he did tacitly agree with [[Palona\|Palona's]] opinion that Sadeas' death solved one problem they had been facing. He and [[Lyn\|Lyn]] at some point scouted past a hidden room that Shallan later discovered while following [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] from the site of her latest murder. When Shallan called [[Adolin\|Adolin]] to the room, Lyn, Teft, [[Renarin\|Renarin]], and other members of Bridge Four arrived with him and accompanied them down to the Midnight Mother's lair, where they helped her dispel the spren's presence.

### Windrunner
 by  Matthew Johnson  Teft mossing
Teft continued to disappear from time to time without explanation of where he was going, though the other members of Bridge Four figured out about his addiction anyway. He was driven to give in to his craving more and more the more money he earned from Dalinar. He at some point spoke the first two oaths of a Windrunner, hoping it would take away his addiction, but quickly realized that it would not; because of his deep-rooted shame, he then hoped to drive away his spren, [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]]. After Teft missed the first training session when Kaladin borrowed the royal emerald reserve because he had binged on firemoss the night before, Kaladin and Rock found him in a moss den, paid his tab, and brought him back to the barracks. After that incident, Teft laid off firemoss use for a while and made sure his behavior seemed more normal to the others. He helped out at recruitment and training events, bringing Lyn over to Kaladin after she drew in Stormlight for the first time and leading a group of Bridge Four members in aerial exercises.
After Kaladin left for the expedition to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], Dalinar delivered the [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] Kaladin had recovered from Szeth to Bridge Four. This allowed them, albeit one at a time, to gain and practice with the powers of a Windrunner even without Kaladin's presence. Teft let Rock take the Honorblade first, but during the time they had possession of the sword, they randomly switched around who carried it so that no one trying to steal it could know whom to target. They continued acting as guards to the Kholins among their other duties; [[Navani\|Navani]] got news of Kholinar's fall and the likely demise of Kaladin's group, but when she informed Bridge Four of the group's trouble, Teft laughed at the suggestion that Kaladin might be dead. They, as representatives of the Radiants, attended the first meeting of monarchs at Urithiru.
During that time, Teft continued to struggle with his addiction. At one point he was arrested and brought before Aladar's magistrates on the charge of public intoxication; Navani used her seal, at Aladar's quiet request, to free him.
Teft and some other squires accompanied Dalinar as his guards when he went to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to check on Amaram's progress helping rebuild the city; Teft was irritated enough by Amaram that he wanted to 'stab him a little.' There was another conference of the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] in the city, and during the course of the gathering someone leaked specific information to each group in attendance that was calculated to undermine their trust in Dalinar. Bridge Four was heavily affected by the news that the first Radiants destroyed their old world before coming to Roshar and that humans were in fact the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]]; they were dispirited enough to leave Thaylen City for Urithiru to discuss the news with those of their members who hadn't come, leaving Dalinar behind. Upon their return to Urithiru, Phendorana appeared to Teft and alerted him to danger. They discovered Rock and [[Bisig\|Bisig]] injured and unconscious in the barracks, while [[Eth\|Eth]], the one who had held the Honorblade that day, was dead. Bisig woke up enough to tell them that the reason they had been taken by surprise was that the perpetrator had been wearing a Bridge Four coat with lieutenant's knots. Teft realized that must have been the coat he had sold to afford a little more firemoss, and he ran from the barracks in shame.

>‚Äú*I will protect those I hate. Even¬†... even if the one I hate most ... is¬†... myself.*‚Äù
\-Teft swearing the Third Ideal[3]

As Teft ran through Urithiru, trying to find a place to hide, Phendorana appeared to him again, and he tried to run from her too. By chance, he ended up in a room that overlooked the Oathgate platforms in time to see an invasion of [[Singers\|singers]] flooding in from the Kholinar platform. Teft found a dark place to hide away for a while, trying to ignore the fighting but able to hear the sounds of it. Hiding there, Phendorana appeared to him yet again and persuaded him to speak his Third Oath.
After they defeated the invading force, Teft appeared in the middle of the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] on Thaylen City's Oathgate with a division of Alethi soldiers and the rest of Bridge Four, whose Windrunner powers were restored thanks to Kaladin's proximity. They chased a group of [[Fused\|Fused]] away from the Oathgate and kept the area secure until the conflict was over. Kaladin sought out Teft after the battle, and they spoke together briefly about what it was like to swear the Ideals before Bridge Four began helping fly the wounded from the city's triage station to the Oathgate. Bridge Thirteen became Teft's squires sometime during or shortly after the conflict, and he at some point discussed the personal words of his Third Oath with the rest of Bridge Four. Over the following year, most of Teft's squires became Radiants themselves.

### Still a Sergeant
 by  Marie Seeberger 
[[Navani\|Navani]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] discussed sending Teft with [[Rysn\|Rysn]] on her [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]], but they ultimately decided against it due to the possibility of the presence of [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces on the island. If that were true, the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition]] didn't want their enemies to have access to a living [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and therefore to be able to unlock the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] and access [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
Teft accompanied the force from Urithiru that went to evacuate [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. After Kaladin's pursuit of [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] failed, Teft flew over to receive instructions and to check on him, feeling concerned about how Kaladin had been looking lately. On Kaladin's orders, he returned to the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]] and instructed them to fight defensive engagements, not worrying over much about keeping the [[Fused\|Fused]] away from the *Fourth Bridge*. On the trip back, Teft approached Kaladin again. Although Kaladin tried to rebuff him, he sat next to him anyway and made him listen to his suggestion that Kaladin go congratulate [[Laran\|Laran]], who had just sworn the Third Ideal. They discussed [[Moash\|Moash]] as well, but when Teft mentioned [[Renarin\|Renarin]] finding Kaladin frozen in battle, Kaladin abruptly left to congratulate Laran. He flew the rest of the way to Urithiru on his own to escape Teft's questions.

>‚Äú*Thank you, Teft. You shouldn't have given up so much. But ‚Ä¶ thank you.*‚Äù
\-Kaladin when Teft became his aide[4]

After Dalinar relieved Kaladin from active duty, Kaladin tried to make Teft companylord of the Windrunners; Teft vehemently opposed this idea, so Kaladin promoted [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] to the position instead. Teft, hearing that Kaladin had decided to become a surgeon and establish a clinic with his father, withdrew from battle himself and became Kaladin's assistant. Kaladin tried to talk him out of staying behind, but Teft was immovable on the subject; eventually Kaladin acknowledged that he was grateful to have Teft with him. The first thing they did together was track down a refugee named [[Noril\|Noril]] at the behest of his niece [[Cressa\|Cressa]], who had come to Kaladin for help finding her uncle. [[Lirin\|Lirin]] remembered sending the man to the [[Ardent\|ardents]], but the ardents directed Teft and Kaladin to the [[Devotary of Mercy\|Devotary of Mercy]]. The [[Kuno\|ardent]] they encountered there was less than helpful until Teft summoned [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]] as a Shardspear. Teft grumbled about finding Noril locked in a bare, dark room, but they convinced Noril to come outside onto the balcony to talk. In the conversation, Teft and Kaladin showed Noril that they understood what he was feeling; while Kaladin demanded that the ardents release Noril into his care, Teft kept chatting with the man about inconsequential things.
Later, Kaladin sent Teft to look for [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]] so the nonverbal bridgeman could join in on the group therapy meetings Kaladin had started, but Teft found that the man had been missing for three days. They went to check with [[Rlain\|Rlain]], as Dabbid sometimes helped him in the fields surrounding Urithiru. Teft and Kaladin met with Rlain in the winehouse [[Adolin\|Adolin]] was fond of visiting. Teft thought about ordering something stronger than the orange wine that he got, but Kaladin reminded him of what he already knew - that giving in a little bit would lead to a slide right back to addiction. They drank a toast "to unfairness" just before Rlain walked in with [[Syl\|Syl]]. The four of them discussed war and Rlain's experience as a bridgeman before talking about Dabbid. Then Teft accused Kaladin of not attending his own group therapy meetings, and the other two sided with Teft until Kaladin promised to attend the next meeting.

### Occupation of Urithiru
Teft dropped unconscious suddenly in the middle of their conversation, the result of [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] successfully activating the [[Sibling\|Sibling's]] defenses with [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] such that it suppressed Radiant powers while still allowing powers fueled by Odium to function. Kaladin felt disoriented for a moment, but he immediately moved to check on Teft, whom he assumed was having either a stroke or a severe aftereffect of withdrawal from firemoss. They decided to take Teft to the [[Order of Edgedancers\|Edgedancer]] clinic, so Kaladin carried him as Rlain led the way. After discovering that all of the Edgedancers were unconscious too, they took Teft up to Lirin's clinic. Syl appeared and confirmed that she couldn't see Phendorana anywhere either.
As Kaladin fed Teft some broth at Lirin's clinic, he observed that Teft seemed closer to waking than the [[Stoneward\|Stoneward]] who was also unconscious in the room. He listened to his father tell him that the best way to help the Radiants was to back down and fill his role as a surgeon; Kaladin agreed with him up until a [[Regal\|Regal]] and a [[Warform\|warform]] soldier came to take Teft to the infirmary where the other Radiants were. Kaladin attacked the two enemy soldiers, killing the Regal and sending the other running. He took the still unconscious Teft on his back and fled to a hidden room at the direction of the Sibling. Kaladin retrieved supplies to feed and clean Teft, and after [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]] found them later, he helped care for the man too. When Dabbid and [[Rlain\|Rlain]] brought [[Lift\|Lift]] to the hidden room to heal Kaladin, she nonchalantly healed Teft too; Teft woke up in time to greet Kaladin as he awoke from the nightmares [[Odium\|Odium]] had given him while he was feverish from an infected wound.

>‚Äú*The others loved him. So, whatever he'd done, he would get up and make it right. That was the oath he‚Äôd taken, and by the Almighty‚Äôs tenth name, he would keep it.  For them.*‚Äù
\-Teft[2]

When Teft woke disoriented and confused, he believed that he had given in to his [[Firemoss\|firemoss]] addiction; he was emboldened to hear that he was still sober. He had to strain to summon Phendorana, who had been unaware of happenings since Teft fell unconscious. Lift had to come by and heal him about every ten hours or he would start to fall back unconscious, and she arrived at one point with Rlain while Dabbid, Kaladin, and Teft were eating soup. The five of them discussed their situation, and, prompted by Kaladin questioning whether it wouldn't be better just to stop fighting, Teft gave the rest a detailed version of his childhood trauma surrounding the [[Envisagers\|Envisagers]] and encouraged them just to do the best they could in their circumstance. They agreed they at least needed to rescue the rest of the Radiants, but decided to wait a few days. Teft found himself feeling happy just to consider the few little things that were still good about life and conceded to Phendorana that she had been right all along to think he was worth saving.

### Final Battle
>‚Äú*You can kill me, but you can't have what I have. You can never have it. Because I die knowing I‚Äôm loved.*‚Äù
\-Teft to Moash[1]


The crew had devised a plan for Kaladin to distract the Fused while Teft and Lift snuck into Lirin's clinic to have Lift heal the unconscious Radiants. They hoped to be able to find a different way to resolve the situation, being unsure quite how they would manage to to escape the tower, but when the Sibling informed them that the enemy had found the final node, they had to resort to their original plan. Upon arriving at the clinic, Teft and Lift had to take down a Regal who was guarding the door. Once inside, they realized they had sprung [[Moash\|Moash's]] trap which he had intended for Kaladin. Moash wounded Lift with [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] before Teft engaged him while wielding only a dagger.
Teft tried to stay out of Moash's reach, prolonging the fight to think of options. Lift began moving toward the Radiants behind Moash's back in order to heal them, so Teft and Phendorana tried to keep Moash from noticing her. Unfortunately, when Moash killed one of the Radiants, Lift cried out and drew his attention; to keep him from killing the girl next, Teft invited him to really fight. Moash easily wounded Teft, sending him to the ground. As he swung his blade to kill him, though, Teft and Phendorana strained together and managed to manifest the spren as a "phantom spear shaft," stopping Moash's blow. Realizing they wouldn't be able to do that again, Teft prepared to lunge at Moash in order to eliminate the advantage of his sword's reach. Before he could move, however, Moash pulled out a [[Raysium\|raysium]] dagger embedded with an [[Anti-Stormlight\|anti-Stormlight]] gem and stabbed Phendorana in the forehead with it. This permanently killed Phendorana, and Teft felt incapacitating agony as a part of his soul was ripped away. Moash hoisted Teft into the air, and Teft knew he was about to die; knowing that he would die as someone who was loved, Teft had a few final words for Moash before Moash killed him with his Honorblade.

 by  Connor Chamberlain  Teft's statue
Moash dropped Teft's body in front of Kaladin as he made towards the Radiant infirmary. On seeing his body, Kaladin was overwhelmed with such a sense of failure and grief that he became insensate; Teft's death was one of the catalysts in Kaladin's decision to jump from the top of Urithiru. However, in Kaladin's vision of [[Tien\|Tien]], Tien addressed Teft's death and helped Kaladin see that he had been discounting all of the times he had helped the man, instead focusing solely on failing to save him from dying. After that, Kaladin accepted that he wouldn't be able to protect everyone and was able to swear his Fourth Ideal.
Rlain sang the Song of the Fallen over Teft's body, while Dabbid knelt next to him and grieved. He channeled Teft while speaking to the group of [[Singers\|singers]] and humans in the atrium about leaving the tower, but realized he probably came across as too gruff. Moash, having gone after Navani but having failed to kill her before she bonded the Sibling, felt pain over killing Teft as Navani and the Sibling's [[Towerlight\|Towerlight]] pushed away his Connection to Odium.
After Urithiru's liberation, Bridge Four had Teft's body [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] into stone, planning to place him in a room the Sibling knew about in the tower in which there were already stone statues of many fallen Radiants. The mortician was unable to change Teft's habitual scowl into a smile, which Bridge Four found appropriate; later, a sculptor would create a likeness of Phendorana to place by him. Bridge Four gathered and drank to his memory and reminisced. Kaladin lingered by the statue while the others left, and he and [[Syl\|Syl]] discussed missing Teft before hugging his statue and leaving him behind. As a final promise kept to Teft, Kaladin began attending his own group therapy sessions.

## Relationships
### Kaladin
>‚Äú*You and I were the start of this though. Figure we ought to stick together.*‚Äù
\-Teft to Kaladin[4]


Teft is the first [[Bridgeman\|bridgeman]] Kaladin approaches to ask for support in his plans for [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]], and he is also the first to suspect Kaladin's nature as a [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]], a suspicion that pays off by saving Kaladin's life. Kaladin in turn suspects that Teft has been a soldier and tricks him into revealing it in the chasms; later, Teft easily falls into the role of Kaladin's sergeant as he begins turning the bridgemen into soldiers. Kaladin is concerned about Teft when he begins disappearing on [[Firemoss\|firemoss]] binges, but he respects Teft's privacy enough to lay off the issue until it becomes a serious problem. Both men take Teft's position as Kaladin's sergeant seriously, meaning that Kaladin listens to Teft's advice at times when he would rather not and Teft knows to balance not letting Kaladin go into situations totally alone with not correcting him sometimes when he is wrong. Teft feels a sense of proprietary pride when he sees Kaladin still fighting after all that has dragged him down.

### Phendorana
>‚Äú*You were storming right. You have always been right.*‚Äù
\-Teft to Phendorana[2]


At first, Teft resents the attention of [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]] and wishes to give up instead of progress in his oaths, as she encourages him to do. She convinces him to swear the Third Ideal, committing himself to continue to struggle onward despite his self-loathing. She later encourages him to open up to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Lift\|Lift]], [[Rlain\|Rlain]], and [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]] about his past with the [[Envisagers\|Envisagers]] when the others wonder whether it is the right thing to do to keep fighting the occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. After the discussion, Teft finds himself smiling because he enjoys life despite its difficulties; he admits to Phendorana that she had been right all along to convince him to keep going and to convince him that he was worth saving. They equally commit to the fight against [[Moash\|Moash]] and somehow manage to manifest Phendorana to form just enough of a spear shaft to stop a blow from Moash that would otherwise have killed Teft. The nature of their bond causes Teft to feel as if some part of him is ripped off of his soul when Phendorana dies. In the end, that pain is what incapacitates Teft to the point that Moash is able to kill him without resistance.

## Trivia
Teft was originally Hine, a character in [[Mythwalker\|Mythwalker]] that did not make it past the revision to be written into [[Warbreaker\|Warbreaker]]. Brandon combined Hine with an aspect of Voko, a different character from Mythwalker, and placed him in Bridge Four as Teft.
