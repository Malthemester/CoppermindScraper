**Korath** (**KoHwo**) was the founder of the [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] religion.
He was a student of [[Keseg\|Keseg]], who began the religion Shu-Keseg. Keseg preached unity, and his two disciples, Korath and [[Dereth\|Dereth]], interpreted this in different ways. Dereth took it to mean unity of governance, while Korath understood it as unity of love. The two split to create two different religions, [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and Shu-Korath.
Korath adopted the [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] symbol [[Aon\|Aon]] Omi to represent both his church and its God. This was a surprising choice, as many new followers of Shu-Korath considered Aons and the Elantrian religion to be heathen. However, by adopting the symbol, Korath hoped to prove that his church should love everybody. The center of Shu-Korath was eventually moved to Teod, after Korath's death.
He had a pendant with the symbol forged, which eventually evolved into the current practice of exchanging Omi pendants at Korathi weddings, as well as the habit of many followers of Shu-Korath wearing the pendants. The pendants eveventually became known as Korathi pendants.
