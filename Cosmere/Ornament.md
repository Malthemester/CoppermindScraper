## Appearance and Personality
Ornament has a delicate and lacelike head pattern. She has a squeaky voice. She has a smooth gliding movement similar to other Cryptics. This is in contrast to [[Pattern\|Pattern]], who has a bouncy movement.
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], Ornament usually rides on the inside of Beryl's shirt near her skin, as she does not like being seen. She likes to watch [[Shallan\|Shallan]] draw along with other Cryptics. She makes excited noises and bounces up and down while doing so.
