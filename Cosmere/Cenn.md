**Cenn** is a young, [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] spearman in [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army. He is looked after by [[Dallet\|Dallet]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] during his first and fatal battle.

## Appearance and Personality
Cenn is young, inexperienced, and bears a certain resemblance to [[Tien\|Tien]]. Before his first battle he gets nervous, exclaiming that he's going to die, and experiences [[Dallet\|Dallet's]] gruff voice as comforting. While fighting he acts brave nonetheless.

## History
Cenn was a [[Chull\|chull]] farmer before joining the army and was fifteen years old when he volunteered to enlist. After barely three months of training Cenn got assigned to [[Gare\|Gare's]] squad, but before his first real battle [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] bribed Gare to transfer Cenn to his own squad to be able to protect the young recruit.
When Cenn found his way to Kaladin's squad he was prepared for the upcoming fight by [[Dallet\|Dallet]], Kaladin's sergeant, who told him to piss even though the army has already formed ranks. As soon as the battle started Cenn was surprised by the chaos of a real fight, as his training led him to believe that there would be more discipline and order in [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army.
During the battle Dallet kept watch over Cenn, regularly pushing him back in formation and giving him some veteran advice. After the squad formed a V formation, Cenn was first placed in the safe center of it. Later Dallet placed him at the bottom of the V pattern, although Cenn did no more than just stand his ground. An hour later Kaladin ordered the squad to abandon the hill they were defending, but in the chaos Cenn got separated from his squadmates. When faced by six enemy soldiers he still tried to make a stroke at the lead soldier but got stabbed in his thigh himself. His foe was about to kill him, were it not that Kaladin took all six of them down, and then Kaladin bound his wound.
When Kaladin attacked a lighteyed officer, Dallet stayed behind with Cenn and the other wounded. Cenn was starting to feel light-headed because he lost too much blood, and when the [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] came for them he just closed his eyes and was trampled by the man's horse.
Cenn hissed a [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattle]] before his death, while Kaladin kneeled over him:

>“* He watches! The black piper in the night. He holds us in his palm... playing a tune that no man can hear!*”
\- Cenn's Death Rattle.[2]
