## History
Jendel was a laborer who lived in the slums of Elendel with his three sons. Around 311 [[Catacendre\|PC]], when [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] was twelve years old, his uncle [[Edwarn\|Edwarn]] brought him to the First Central Bank to teach him about banking. Edwarn and Wax observed two men seeking a loan, Jendel and a wealthy man named [[Nikolin\|Nikolin]]. Edwarn told Wax that most banks would only lend money to Nikolin. However, he had instituted a policy wherein First Central Bank would loan money to riskier debtors, but with unfavorable loan terms such as extremely high interest rates and potential . Edwarn had also marketed aggressively to people that would not normally qualify for a loan. Edwarn and his colleagues had effectively invented  in Elendel.
Upon hearing about the draconian terms of the contract that Jendel was about to sign, Wax intervened. He attempted to give Jendel a rare, valuable coin that Edwarn had just gifted him. Jendel did not accept the coin, not believing that someone would give him something so valuable. Edwarn was incensed, but was able to smoothly convince Jendel to sign the loan papers anyway. Jendel was not able to fulfill the loan terms, and committed suicide by jumping off a bridge eight years later. His sons remained indebted to the bank after his death.
Wax recounted Jendel's story to [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] after [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] sent him a message on the rare coin that Jendel had refused. He told Steris that the incident with Jendel was one of the factors that drove him to leave the unscrupulous, bureaucratic environment of Elendel to seek adventure in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]].
