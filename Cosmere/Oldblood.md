## Appearance
Physically, an Oldblood looks like an ordinary [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] Alethi. However, if someone wishes to acknowledge that they are an Oldblood, they wear a blue tattoo on their cheek.

## History
Little is known about the origin of the Oldbloods, but they are said to have ruled Alethkar many years ago. In fact, they claim to be able to trace their lineage directly to the ancient [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. At some point in history, the Oldbloods were removed from power and no longer present a threat to the current monarchy of Alethkar. People with Oldblood ancestry continue to wear face tattoos as a symbolic acknowledgement of their former rule. However, they do not commonly discuss their connection to the Knights Radiant due to their poor reputation following the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]]. Some Oldbloods may also feel an elevated sense of loyalty to the throne since they once held it.
