A **Feast of Light** is a gathering, party, or event that at least [[Honorspren\|honorspren]], and perhaps other varieties of [[Spren\|spren]], go to.
It is unclear what such a feast entails. Judging from its name, it could involve [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]].
On a [[Reacher\|Reacher]] ship, Captain [[Ico\|Ico]] gave [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] clothing to wear, such as a waistcoat and a jacket, which he adapted to his needs and fashion sense. Once Adolin was dressed, Ico remarked that Adolin looked like an honorspren going to a Feast of Light. It is possible that since Adolin appeared like a lord, that a Feast of Light is a high society event for honorspren or spren.
