>“* The course is obvious, isn’t it? We must reclaim my nation from the hands of the traitor parshmen; then we must conquer Tukar. It is completely unreasonable to allow this insane man, who claims to be a god, to continue bereaving the glorious Azish Empire.*”
\- Vexil to the coalition leaders[1]


**Vexil the Wise** is the Prime of the [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] kingdom of [[Emul\|Emul]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
As with many of the Makabaki monarchs, Vexil is often referred to simply as **Emul**.

## Personality
Little is known of Vexil's personality. He has a passionate hatred for both the [[Tukar\|Tukari]] and their ruler [[Tezim\|Tezim]]. He is also a grateful man, very appreciative of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] offer to help him secure the last of his lands. As ruler of Emul, he obviously seeks to promote his kingdom whenever possible, but is ultimately realistic enough to accept that his personal priorities are not those of the other kingdoms of Roshar.

## History
Little is known of Vexil's early life. At some point he and the princess of [[Yezier\|Yezier]] engaged in a romantic relationship that eventually came to an end. He became Prime sometime after [[Ashno\|Ashno of Sages]] had completed his time as Emuli Prime. Vexil spent a portion of his rule embroiled in the [[Eighty's War\|Eighty's War]] with the kingdom of Tukar and its god-priest Tezim. By late 1173, Vexil's power in the kingdom was waning with the kingdom invaded and refugees flooding into neighboring [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]].
Following the arrival of the Everstorm, and an assault by the [[Singers\|singers]] as they moved through Emul to [[Marat\|Marat]], Vexil was even further weakened. He and Ashno traveled to [[Azimir\|Azimir]] and accompanied the by leaders and representatives of the rest of the Makabak Empire through the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Upon his arrival, Vexil sought to advocate for his kingdom. In a meeting with the rest of the rulers of the coalition kingdoms, Vexil asked that their next move be to reclaim his land lost to the [[Singer\|singers]] and then conquer the kingdom of Tukar. This proposal was dismissed, as the coalition wished to focus on securing what lands they had first. Alethi Highprince [[Aladar\|Aladar]] offered the aid of several of his experts in fortification to help Vexil defend what lands were left to Emul, but not to yet try to reclaim any lost lands. Vexil gratefully accepted Aladar's offer.
Prior to the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Vexil traveled to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to the meeting of coalition leaders before the battle. He spoke to Aladar there about tactics. After the revelations about Dalinar's role as highking, conversations with Odium, and the potential dangers of Surgebinding, Vexil seems to have departed the city, possibly with the Azish. After the battle, Vexil seems to have returned to Thaylen City and spoke to the princess of [[Yezier\|Yezier]], as their guards cleaned up rubble. This spurred rumors that the two were rekindling their romantic relationship.
