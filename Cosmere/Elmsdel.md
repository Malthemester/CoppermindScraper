**Elmsdel** is a city in the southeastern portion of the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]]. It is northwest of [[Garmet\|Garmet]], and near to the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]].
[[Steris\|Steris]] mentions that travel between Elmsdel and [[Rashekin\|Rashekin]] requires passage through [[Elendel\|Elendel]] as there are no rail lines bypassing the capital. This then leads to all commerce being subject to Elendel's taxes twice; once for the rail taxes and then again for entering Elendel. She argues that this is a reason for the discontentment of the rest of the Basin.
[[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] and [[Steris\|Steris]] are married in the penthouse apartment of someone who has moved to Elmsdel for a long vacation.
