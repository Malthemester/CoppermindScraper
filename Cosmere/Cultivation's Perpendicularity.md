**Cultivation's Perpendicularity**, referred to as "the pool" or the "water of life" by the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]], is the only known stable [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Like all perpendicularities, Cultivation's Perpendicularity allows for travel between [[Roshar\|Roshar's]] [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] and [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. Although it is possible to enter Roshar through other means, they are known to be highly unstable; as such, this appears to be the main method by which [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] arrive at the planet.

Cultivation's Perpendicularity is located in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] on Roshar. It is either one or all of the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]], warm bodies of water that allow people to live there despite the high altitude. It's filled with ordinary water at the top; however, beneath this layer, it appears to be made of something else, likely the liquid [[Investiture\|Investiture]] of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. It's possible that living near Cultivation's Perpendicularity can affect people, as among the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]]--the Horneaters--there are people known as *alaii'iku*, or [[Sighted\|Sighted]], who are capable of perceiving [[Spren\|spren]] that are normally invisible to the human eye. The Sighted are also considered the guardians of the perpendicularity.

## History
Sometimes while swimming in the Oceans, the Horneaters would visit the "place of the gods", implying that the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] would sometimes travel through the perpendicularity, albeit briefly.
Both [[Wit\|Wit]] and [[Azure\|Azure]] used this perpendicularity when arriving on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The former passed through while [[Rock\|Rock]] was still at the Peaks, while the latter likely uses it some time later, chasing a "criminal", presumably [[Zahel\|Zahel]].
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the perpendicularity was assaulted through Shadesmar by the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]], who took control of, and blockaded, it to control travel, as they believed it would help secure them a foothold in the realm so they could begin to build their own empire. Though it seemed that the Voidbringer presence in the region was limited to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], it still had some sort of impact on the inhabitants of the Peaks.
Since the [[Fused\|Fused]] increased their influence in Shadesmar, travelers moving through the perpendicularity have become uncommon. This occupation gained the area a poor reputation, and travel to the area became increasingly rarer with ships in the area vanishing before they reached their destination. The Fused began sailing their warships through the region, halting anyone they came upon and demanding tribute of them. Because of this, most spren chose to avoid the region; with the exception of the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] who sent warships to attempt to destroy the Fused's blockades, and [[Azure\|Azure]] who still believed it to be the safest way to transfer to the Physical Realm. When she accidentally finds herself stuck in Shadesmar, Azure attempts to convince [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and the other members of their group that they should try and go to the perpendicularity to transfer back to the Physical Realm.
