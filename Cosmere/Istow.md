4 Notes


## Appearance and Personality
She is tall and has graying hair. She strictly enforces the dueling codes, and sometimes maintains an imperious attitude. She prefers that duelists use classic, beautiful [[Stances\|stances]], and is not immune to reacting emotionally if a combatant uses unseemly (but technically legal) tactics.

## Attributes and Abilities
She is likely the ranking highjudge on the Shattered Plains, as she oversees most of the duels contested by the nobility. She and several other female judges record scores, keep the dueling rankings, and hold books of dueling code used in adjudicating disputes and determining the winner of the bout. As highjudge, her rule is law within the dueling arena with authority granted by the king; the king himself is the only person that can overturn her decisions. She observes duels from a special stone dais overseeing the arena. She initiates bouts and can end them at her discretion if the duel becomes dangerous.

## History
Istow presided over many of [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin's]] duels, including a friendly duel against [[Resi\|Resi]] and duels for [[Shardwielding\|shards]] against [[Salinor Eved\|Salinor]] and [[Elit Ruthar\|Elit]]. She did not approve of Adolin's brutal approach in his match against Salinor or his boring tactics in his win over Elit, but in both cases she was forced to admit that he had not broken any rules.

### Disadvantaged Duel
Istow also presided over the duel between Adolin and the team of [[Relis\|Relis]], Elit, [[Abrobadar\|Abrobadar]] and [[Jakamav\|Jakamav]]. Istow was present when Relis challenged Adolin. When she asked Adolin if he knew the exact terms of the duel and if he understood what he was doing. Adolin dismissed her brusquely, so she made no attempt to explain that he had agreed to a full disadvantaged duel against a team, rather than a paired disadvantaged duel against two people. After the duel began, Adolin realized that continuing a four-on-one fight was foolish, and tried to signal to Istow to end the duel, but she seemed to purposefully ignore him. She also angrily denied [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] when he called for her to end the duel after [[Renarin\|Renarin]] also entered the arena, claiming that Adolin had not surrendered and that her word was law. Adolin theorized that Istow may have accepted a bribe from Sadeas's camp to allow the duel to continue despite the fact that he would likely be injured or killed.
After [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] joined the fight and helped turn the tide, Istow confirmed Abrobadar and Elit's surrender, the latter with noticeable reluctance. She was disturbed by Relis's bizarre reaction to "hearing" his Shardblade, announcing his forfeit when he ran from the arena. She awarded the victory to Adolin after Jakamav surrendered and was present when he exercised his [[Right of Challenge\|Right of Challenge]].
