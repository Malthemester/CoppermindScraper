## Philosophy
Those who join the Elsecallers generally subscribe to a philosophy that they should be becoming better with each oath, seeking to explore their true potential and reach it. The order is more open to all types of people, as long as they want to improve themselves. They tend to attract those who are less flamboyant, scholars, theologians, and those who are interested in leadership. Modern lore connects the Elsecallers with the gemstone Zircon, the number seven, the [[Ten Essences\|essence]] tallow, and the body focus oil. They are associated with the attributes of wisdom and cautiousness.
The Elsecallers are one of the scholarly orders of Knights Radiant. Inkspren are attracted to people who think through decisions rather than acting on instinct. This quality is usually associated with scholars, but can also apply to a soldier who thinks things through instead of rushing into battle. Before the Recreance, the order also had a fair number of theologians and leaders, and was generally considered one of the most welcoming. The Elsecallers are widely considered the wisest and most careful of the Radiants, and were some of the Radiants' best tacticians and logistical organizers.

## Ideals of the Elsecallers
The Ideals of the Knights Radiant, also known as the [[Immortal Words\|Immortal Words]], are a set of rules by which the Radiants live. The First Ideal is shared by all of the orders, and is used as a motto for the Knights Radiant as a whole. Each of the orders then have an additional four Ideals that are unique to that order. The Ideals of the Order of Elsecallers all focus on progressing with each Ideal and discovering and reaching one's true potential. As a result, the order is more open to all types of people, as long as they want to improve themselves.

### The First Ideal
>“*Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.*”
\-The First Ideal of the Knights Radiant[6]


The Elsecallers are one of the orders that allows a Machiavellian interpretation of the First Ideal. To them, the journey is about the entire species more than the individual.

## Abilities
 by  Steve Argyle 
>“*As to the other orders that were inferior in this visiting of the far realm of spren, the Elsecallers were prodigiously benevolent, allowing others as auxiliary to their visits and interactions; though they did never relinquish their place as prime liaisons with the great ones of the spren; and the Lightweavers and Willshapers both also had an affinity to the same, though neither were true masters of that realm.*”
\-Words of Radiance, chapter 6, page 2[1]


The Elsecallers use the Surges of **Transformation** and **Transportation**.

### Transformation
Transformation can be manipulated to change an object into one of the ten essences. Soulcasting transforms one material into another, though Soulcasting into one of the Ten Essences is easiest. To [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]], the Elsecaller shifts their perception to see into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], and communicates with the Cognitive aspect of the object they want to transform. This is normally done through direct contact with an object, however, can be performed from a distance. Elsecallers are more skilled at doing this than Lightweaver. Elsecallers tend to view Soulcasting differently from Lightweavers.

### Transportation
Transportation allows the transfer of one's physical body into and out of the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. It works by creating a miniature [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] that the Elsecaller can go through. It is significantly easier to enter the Cognitive Realm using Elsecalling than it is to leave it. It is possible for Elsecallers to leave the Cognitive Realm without seeking a perpendicularity however this is a more advanced skill than entering. Elsecallers are able to use this ability to [[Worldhop\|worldhop]].

### Shardplate Abilities
Their Shardplate, which they get after an unknown Ideal, is made up of [[Logicspren\|logicspren]].

## History
>“*As the duly appointed keepers of the perfect gems, we of the Elsecallers have taken the burden of protecting the ruby nicknamed Honor’s Drop. Let it be recorded.*”
\-Urithiru gem archive, zircon from drawer 20-10[20]


They were the prime liaisons with the great ones of the spren. They were considered prodigiously benevolent by the author of the book *Words of Radiance*. They were appointed as the keepers of the [[Perfect gem\|perfect gems]] and took it upon themselves to protect [[Honor's Drop\|Honor's Drop]]. Some Elsecallers worldhopped to other planets, which is hinted at in names of places on the map of Shadesmar. The Elsecallers were one of the nine orders to betray their oaths, killing many inkspren and dropping [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] during the [[Recreance\|Recreance]].
Around six years before the start of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the inkspren [[Ivory\|Ivory]] bonded [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], re-forming the Elsecallers. Jasnah, and therefore the Elsecallers, was the first of the currently known Radiants to swear the First Ideal and re-form. Jasnah is currently the only Elsecaller, as all new-generation inkspren except Ivory are unwilling to take the risk of a bond.
