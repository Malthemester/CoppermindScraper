**Zu** is a [[Striker\|Striker]] from [[Mulla'dil\|Mulla'dil]] in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He is the captain of the guard in the [[Rose Palace\|Rose Palace]].

## Appearance and Personality
Zu is a young, tall man with a lean musculature and pale skin. He has dark hair which he keeps styled, indicating that he does not usually wear a helmet. He has wide lips.
He is an ambitious man who fancies himself bound for important things in the future. He is simpleminded but very useful when the arbiters need someone killed. He is uncomfortable with [[Forgery\|Forgery]].

## History
Zu is one of the guards ordered to bring [[Wan ShaiLu\|Wan ShaiLu]] before the five [[Arbiter\|arbiters]] of the [[Heritage Faction\|Heritage Faction]] after she is captured. He shows a great dislike for Shai, promising that he'll eventually kill her because he feels insecure about his failure to apprehend her when she steals from the Rose Palace. After Shai learns that Emperor [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]] is comatose, Zu is assigned to oversee the security of her room. He is the only Striker who knows of Ashravan's injury and the deal that the arbiters strike with Shai to create an [[Essence Mark\|Essence Mark]] that will revive him. He personally guards the arbiters that come to visit Shai's room.
Once Shai completes her work on the emperor's soul, Zu comes into her room, dismisses the guards inside, then tries to kill her. He manages to wound Shai with his sword, but he then falls through the floor due to a trap previously set by Shai, injuring his forehead and falling unconscious. When he wakes up, he goes to [[Weedfingers\|the Bloodsealer]] and they manage to track Shai again using the blood on his sword. This time, however, Shai easily bests him using her *Shaizan* Essence Mark. She breaks his wrist and six of his ribs. He is amazed at her ability. She steals his tall, white, [[Gurish\|Gurish]] warhorse to escape; it is worth more than a small house in some parts of the Rose Empire.
