## Appearance and History
 by  Esther Schrader 
For more images, see [[Vedel/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Vedel would appear as [[Alethi\|Alethi]] to modern Rosharans. She was born on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] and made the trip to Roshar during the [[Expulsion\|Expulsion]]. She was someone important in the pre-[[Desolation\|Desolations]] society -- a queen, scholar, or general. Along with the others, she approached [[Honor\|Honor]] and formed the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. Whenever a Desolation ended, she'd travel along with them to [[Braize\|Braize]], when she suffered torture until one of them broke. She broke at least once, starting a new Desolation.
While on Roshar, she would train surgeons in anticipation of the incoming Desolation. Once the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] formed, she admitted patronage of the [[Order of Edgedancers\|Order of Edgedancers]]. At the time of the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]], Vedel decided with the other Heralds to give up the Oathpact and leave [[Taln\|Taln]] alone on Braize. It is not known where she went or what she's been doing during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].


## Attributes and Abilities

For more information about Heralds' powers, see Herald#Abilities.
Vedel is a [[Herald\|Herald]], making her a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] and thus immortal. When she dies, she returns to [[Braize\|Braize]] to be tortured. Until [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], she wielded a [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], which gave her access to the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]] and [[Progression\|Progression]], and she was a capable swordswoman.
She might've been a doctor before she became a Herald, as she has vast medical knowledge, and trained new surgeons before a Desolation. It's likely that a lot of the Heralds' teachings regarding medicine -- such as the mandate to always wash hands before an operation -- came from her.

## Culture
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] Vedel's chapter icon
Like all the Heralds, Vedel's name has become part of culture. In [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], she is called **Vedeledev**, and swearing by Vedeledev's golden keys is used to express astonishment. "Vedeledev knows" is also used. The name is sometimes shortened to **Vev** -- this is used both as an expression of its own, and as the Vorin number 4. Names [[Vedelliar\|Vedelliar]] and [[Vevidar\|Vevidar]] are probably derived from Vedel.
Within the context of the [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]], Vedel is traditionally associated with the Loving and Healing Divine Attributes, the [[Polestone\|gemstone]] diamond, and the Essence of lucentia.
The golden keys that people swear by and that are present in some artwork of her are derived from a Rosharan myth; though they have really existed, they are more symbolic than actually imbued with any power. What the myth is about is undetermined.

## Trivia
Three of the [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattle]] epigraphs in *The Way of Kings* are from the month of vev, one in 1172 and two in 1173.
Vedel is featured as one of the *Oathbringer* endpapers.
Brandon has compared the golden keys to the Biblical flaming sword that's said to protect the passage to the tree of life in the Garden of Eden. It's uncertain whether the two serve similar purpose, or if they're both simply mythological artifacts.
Vedel's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the Healer by the [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] staff.
