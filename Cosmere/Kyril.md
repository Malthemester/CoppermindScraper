## Appearance and Personality
He has the marbled skin of a [[Singer\|singer]]. He is stern and overbearing, and has a very short temper. Like many Fused, he may not be completely sane.

## Attributes and Abilities
Kyril's brand of Fused is not clear, but he is capable of flying, implying that he may be a *shanay-im*.

## History
Kyril was among the Fused that was freed from [[Braize\|Braize]] towards the beginning of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. He and another Fused, who was noted to be insane, were assigned to regularly visit Celebrant to inspect ships and ensure that local [[Spren\|spren]] officials were continuing to obey the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] properly.
Kyril had been visiting Celebrant for several months by the time he arrived there to track down the group that had fled [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] through [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], including [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Azure\|Azure]], [[Syl\|Syl]], and [[Pattern\|Pattern]]. Kyril examined Captain [[Ico's ship\|Ico's ship]] and found traces of human habitation there, including remains of food and a [[Hydrator\|hydrator]]. He attempted to threaten [[Ico\|Ico]] for information, but accidentally started a fire instead.
After leaving the blazing ship, he stormed into the office of the dock registrar. He encountered several members of Shallan's team, but she was able to avoid detection using her Lightweaver abilities. Kyril demanded to know why he wasn't informed of humans arriving in the city, but the registrar covered for the group, only replying that Kyril hadn't asked him for the information. The Fused ordered the registrar to put out the fire, then told him he would be sacked. He left and flew towards the city market searching for the humans. After the group reconvened, they boarded the *Honor's Path*, despite Syl's status as a fugitive among the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]]. Kyril returned to the port, but did not approach his quarry, seemingly afraid of the honorspren. He saw the group board the ship, but he did not follow, instead flying away in a different direction. He presumably relayed what he had seen to his superiors, as the Fused subsequently engaged in a large-scale pursuit of the *Honor's Path*.
