This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
A **poltergeist** is the spirit of a dead human being that must possess the bodies of the living in order to retain consciousness. It is unclear what causes a person to become a poltergeist upon their death, but it seems that not everyone does.

## Appearance
Poltergeists are completely invisible to living humans. To other poltergeists, however, they appear in their unembodied form as a glowing translucent field that seeps along surfaces, looking almost like a mold. When possessing a living person, they look exactly like that person, although attributes like facial expressions may reflect that of the poltergeist. Possessed humans also give off a bright yellow glow to other poltergeists, allowing them to recognize each other.
