**Vapor** is a [[Figment\|figment]] who lives on Starsight and who works for [[Cuna\|Cuna]]. Vapor may or may not be her actual name, but she requests that her flight call her that.

## History
Vapor was one of the many pilots who participated in a practice battle organized by [[Winzik\|Winzik]] to weed out less suitable pilots. She inhabited a small Krell drone during the battle. When Morrimur’s fighter was incapacitated and Spensa sent out a distress call, Vapor agreed to help as long as Spensa didn’t shoot her. At Spensa’s request, Vapor defended Morrimur from enemy ships as Spensa worked to remove a chunk of debris from Morrimur’s booster.
After the test battle, Vapor was assigned to [[Spensa\|Spensa]], [[Brade\|Brade]], and [[Hesho\|Hesho]]’s flight, and introduced herself to them.
