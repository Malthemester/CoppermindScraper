>“*We knew Ned would go too far at some point. Everyone did. I don’t think any of us was surprised when, after she tried to drag him away from the tavern that night, he finally went over the edge.*”
\-The All's Alley thugs' opinion on Ned's temper.[1]


**Ned** is a resident of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] from Sadeas' camp. He is married to [[Rem\|Rem]]. He is dropped off a high ledge by [[Ur (character)\|Ur]] after a barmaid from [[All's Alley\|All's Alley]] is killed. He wears a ring.

## History
Ned lived in the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] and relocated to Urithiru after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. His wife Rem followed him to Urithiru.
[[Betha\|Betha]], a hired thug at All's Alley, knew Ned to be an extremely angry drunk. Betha and the other thugs were not surprised when Ned strangled Rem after she tried to take him home from the bar one night. During the attack, he scraped Rem's face with the ring he was wearing. The next day, one of the barmaids at All's Alley was killed in the exact same way. Betha's group of thugs are paid to protect the bar, and they assumed that Ned was also behind the second murder and had to be killed as a security threat. Ur, one of Betha's associates, dropped Ned off a high plateau despite his denial of murdering the barmaid. If he had not killed the barmaid, Betha had planned to leave any actions against him to [[Aladar\|Aladar's]] police force.
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] learned of Ned's crimes from Betha while investigating murders that might be related to [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas']] death. She later realized that the barmaid had been killed by the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], who had copied the initial murder.
