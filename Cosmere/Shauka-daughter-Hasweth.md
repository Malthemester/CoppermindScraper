**Shauka-daughter-Hasweth** is a [[Shin\|Shin]] philosopher on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She may be the sister of another Shin scholar, [[Ali-daughter-Hasweth\|Ali-daughter-Hasweth]].
She was one of several that [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] asked if [[Shallan\|Shallan]] had read during her evaluation for wardship. Shallan had not heard the name previously and felt incredulous surprise that there were Shin logicmasters. Later Shallan bought a thin, green volume written by Shauka-daughter-Hasweth from a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] book merchant, [[Artmyrn\|Artmyrn]], who admitted to never having heard any of her works read, saying: "I didn't realize that there were any Shin philosophers of note."
