**Beznk** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] sailor on the *Wind's Pleasure* under Captain [[Tozbek\|Tozbek]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
He was part of the crew that sailed with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] and [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. He was presumably a friend of his crewmate [[Yalb\|Yalb's]], as Yalb made a joking comment about Shallan's backside to Beznk.
It is unclear if Beznk was one of the few survivors of the sinking of the *Wind's Pleasure*.
