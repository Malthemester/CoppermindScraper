## Beliefs
According to Vorinism, those who best fulfill their Callings during life are summoned by the Almighty in the afterlife to perform their Callings in service of the [[War for Heaven\|War for Heaven]]. In the afterlife, each person's abilities related to their Calling are greatly enhanced: for example, a farmer can grow huge fields of crops with a wave of the hand and a spearman can create thunder and lightning with their weapons. Anyone who is not chosen will simply sleep until the end of the war.
Fitting the needs of the War for Heaven, being a soldier is considered the highest and most honored Calling, at least in the warlike [[Alethi\|Alethi]] culture; the [[Ardent\|ardents]] teach that any Calling is noble and can allow one to be chosen by the Almighty, with farming being especially necessary, but those of other Callings often feel that they are valued much less than soldiers in practice.

## Philosophy
The aim of the Callings is to help people improve themselves and capitalize on their individual talents as best they can, which Vorinism sees as a fundamental way of worshiping the Almighty (since those talents were provided by the Almighty in the first place).
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], while he is a [[Bridgeman\|bridgeman]], reflects on the holes in the idea, wondering whether he and the other bridgemen, who don't have the freedom to talk to ardents or pursue Callings of their own choice, might be forced by the Almighty to continue the terrible work of running bridges in the afterlife. Later on, even when he is in a much better place in life, he is frustrated by the discrepancy between the dreaming and self-improvement encouraged by the religion and the constraints placed on [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] by society.

## Process
People can choose Callings at a young age, including while they are teenagers or younger. Although the choice is a personal one, it still does have to fit with Vorin norms of propriety when it comes to rank and the [[Arts and Majesty\|masculine and feminine arts]]. For example, low-ranked [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] can reasonably choose archery as a Calling, but being an officer is out of reach. Changing one's Calling is accepted but uncommon.
Along with a Calling, each person chooses a [[Glory\|Glory]], which is an aspect of the Almighty to emulate. Although it often makes sense for a person's Glory and Calling to be related, they don't need to directly reinforce each other.
Once someone chooses a Calling and a Glory, they work with ardents of the appropriate devotary to regularly set and fulfill relevant personal goals. As a mark of achievement when their goals have been reached, a person can **Elevate** and reach **Points** in their Calling and Glory. Doing so requires the presence of an ardent and presumably some kind of evaluation, such as a test of the person's abilities.
Being an ardent may itself be a Calling, but there are ardents with other Callings, such as cooking.
