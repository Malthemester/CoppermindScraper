The **Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner** is the reception following the wedding of [[Joshin Yomen\|Joshin Yomen]] and [[Mi'chelle Ostlin\|Mi'chelle Ostlin]].
Nearly the entirety of the [[Elendel\|Elendel]] upper class was invited to the event. Those who were not were specifically not invited to reinforce their outsider status in elite society; some of the upper class' least savory figures were also invited to maximize the insult to those who were not.
Wax and [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] attend as the official start of their relationship. [[Jackstom Harms\|Jackstom Harms]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] both accompany Steris. [[Wayne\|Wayne]] gatecrashes as a waiter.
The [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] invade under the guise of daylight robbery, kidnapping both Steris and Marasi and killing Lord [[Peterus\|Peterus]].
Wax and Wayne plan and execute a counter-attack, rescuing Marasi and forcing the Vanishers into retreat. The constabulary arrive and berate Wax for saving everyone.

## Trivia

[[Hoid\|Hoid]] appeared at the dinner dressed as a beggar; he was there simply to congratulate friends.
