**Ulef** is a young skaa thief from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is young and gangly. He is relatively naive for someone who has grown up in the underworld. [[Vin\|Vin]] thinks that he is nice, but also knows that he would betray her in the name of self-preservation.

## History
Ulef was a member of [[Camon\|Camon's]] [[Camon's crew\|thief crew]] at the same time as Vin. Vin noted on several occasions that Ulef was the only member of the crew that showed her any sort of kindness.
After Camon's attempt to scam [[Arriev\|Arriev]], Vin asked Ulef to run away with her because she believed that the [[Obligator\|obligators]] might send [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitors]] to attack the safehouse. Ulef was the closest thing Vin had to a friend; she also did not want to leave alone, and believed that Ulef had contacts in Luthadel that could help the two of them get new jobs. Vin approached Ulef while he and a few other members of the crew were drinking together. Ulef and the others initially thought that Vin might have had a romantic interest in Ulef, but Vin quickly informed Ulef of her desire to leave. Ulef agreed, and Vin started to gather her belongings. While she was distracted, Ulef snitched to Camon. Ulef appeared to feel guilty as he watched Camon beat Vin mercilessly.
After [[Dockson\|Dockson]] and [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] appeared in [[Camon's safehouse\|Camon's safehouse]], Ulef was very excited about working with them; he seemed to idolize Kelsier. After quickly getting over his guilt about betraying Vin, he relayed several rumors about Kelsier's exploits to her. Like the rest of Camon's crew, he assumed that Kelsier and his crew had chosen Vin as the go-between for the two crews.
The [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]] was still looking for Camon and Vin, and an Inquisitor eventually found the safehouse and butchered everyone that he found there. Vin saw Ulef's mangled body and was shocked by the brutality of the Inquisitor. Vin was sad about Ulef's death and put some of the blame on herself, but she still did not consider him a friend.
