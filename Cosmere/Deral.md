**Captain Deral** was an [[Elisian\|Elisian]] man who traveled with Duchess [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]] and her party to [[Dayside\|Dayside]].

## History
 and his lieutenant were killed by [[Baon\|Baon]] while on the journey from Elis, while the three were scouting ahead. Baon lied about the incident to Khriss about the incident saying that the border patrol had killed the two men while giving the three of them chase. [[Jon Acron\|Jon Acron]] confessed apparent inconsistencies in Baon's tale to Khriss, and Baon later confessed to killing them when Khriss observed that the two pistols he carried were taken from Deral and his lieutetnant.
Later, when Acron is revealed as an assassin from [[Skathan\|Skathan]], Baon returns and explains what really happened. He says that Deral was a fool, and that he was planning on selling Khriss to the [[Dynasty\|Dynastic]] border patrol. Baon says that he took no pleasure in doing so, but was forced to kill them in order to ensure the safety of his and Kriss' missions.
