This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Elend's mother** is a noblewoman in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
By the time Elend met [[Vin\|Vin]], his mother had presumably died; he spoke of her in the past tense. The circumstances of her death are not known. She had significant influence on Elend, and he took after her more than [[Straff\|Straff]].
Elend told Vin that his mother was fond of telling him that "it does gentlemen good to wait upon a lady's whims". Vin said that she sounded like a wise woman, although Elend countered that she was not wise enough to avoid marrying Straff.

## Trivia
Although some fans remain curious about Elend's mother's background, Brandon has stated that it is not particularly relevant to the *Mistborn* story.
