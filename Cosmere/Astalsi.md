>“* There were a group of people before the Ascension known as the Astalsi. They claimed that each person was born with a certain finite amount of ill luck. And so, when an unfortunate event happened, they thought themselves blessed—thereafter, their lives could only get better.*”
\- Sazed preaching to Vin[1]


**Astalsi** is an ancient religion from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. They don't survive the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] reign, but [[Sazed\|Sazed]] keeps knowledge about them in his [[Feruchemy\|metalminds]].
The Astalsi followers are rather advanced, and mix religion with science. They develop a detailed scale to express different colors, and think that these different colors are indications of different kinds of fortune.
They believe that each person was born with a certain finite amount of bad luck, and for them a poor life was a sign of fortune yet to come. For this reason Sazed preaches the Astalsi religion to [[Vin\|Vin]], given that Vin already had been through a lot during her life.

## Trivia
Astalsi was a motivation for [[Warbreaker\|Warbreaker]].
The Astalsi and [[Dadradah\|Dadradah]] religions are "branches of a more ancient religion".
