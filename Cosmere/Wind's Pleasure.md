## History
 by  Marie Seeberger  The *Wind's Pleasure* arriving in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]
### Chartered by Shallan
The *Wind's Pleasure* was originally chartered by [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to take her to [[Dumadari\|Dumadari]] to meet [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]]. Captain Tozbek noted that he was indebted to [[House Davar\|House Davar]] and was happy to have Shallan on board. Upon finding that Jasnah was no longer in Dumadari, Shallan asked Tozbek to continue on to the next city. This pattern repeated as Jasnah moved along the coastline doing research. When the *Wind's Pleasure* finally caught up to Jasnah in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] and Shallan was taken as Jasnah's ward, Captain Tozbek continued on, trading in other ports. Shallan later sent a note to Tozbek inquiring as to his whereabouts, which he took as a request to pick her up and take her back to [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. Shallan also acted as a scribe for Tozbek to offset the cost of her travels.

### Final Voyage
Jasnah later chartered the *Wind's Pleasure* to take her and Shallan down the coast towards the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Jasnah paid for the use of one cabin for Shallan and one for herself; Jasnah took the Captain's cabin. At [[Amydlatn\|Amydlatn]], the *Wind's Pleasure* took on a [[New kid\|new crew member]]. While traveling down the coast, the *Wind's Pleasure* was paced by an exceptionally rare animal called a [[Santhid\|santhid]], which Shallan desperately wanted to sketch. She tied a rope around herself and went overboard in order to see the creature underwater, later producing the first known drawing of a santhid.

Shortly before reaching the [[Shallow Crypts\|Shallow Crypts]], the new member of the crew assisted in an armed takeover of the *Wind's Pleasure*. The attackers sought to murder [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] and retrieve her research; Jasnah was confident that the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] were behind this plot. Shallan hid during the assault and unconsciously used her Lightweaving abilities to escape detection. With [[Pattern\|Pattern's]] assistance, she then entered [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] and saw that the crew was being methodically executed. Using her latent [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] ability, she convinced the *Wind's Pleasure* to change so that the crew might have a chance to survive. The *Wind's Pleasure* changed into a new form, dropping everyone aboard into the water. Shallan woke up in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] and believed that the santhid had saved her; neither she nor Pattern knew the fate of the remaining crew members and attackers.
[[Yalb\|Yalb]] and two other unknown sailors who survived the sinking of the *Wind's Pleasure* struggled at finding a job due to rumors about the mysterious disappearance of their ship. Some sailors believed that the ship had been a ghost ship for years, and that was the reason it eventually vanished without a trace. Because of the rumors, no one was willing to hire the three survivors together, and they each went their own way to serve on different ships.

## Legacy
Shallan later learned that [[Tyn\|Tyn]] had masterminded the attack on the ship.
Shallan and Jasnah each lost their [[Spanreed\|spanreeds]] in the sinking of the *Wind's Pleasure*, which limited their ability to communicate; Jasnah considered the loss a significant setback for her research. When Jasnah and Shallan finally met again in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Jasnah immediately apologized for the events of the *Wind's Pleasure*, which she attributed to her own lack of foresight regarding the attack by the Ghostbloods.
Shallan took a liking to Yalb, who often playfully flirted with her. She thought of him when she became upset about the death that seemed to follow her despite her best intentions, and he was one of the first figures that emerged when Shallan used Lightweaving to create an army during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
