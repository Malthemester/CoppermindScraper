The **pact of the Seven Peaks** is an ancient treaty on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It involves the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] and one or more unknown parties that they refer to as gods.

## History
The pact of the Seven Peaks has only been mentioned by [[Cord\|Cord]] while talking to [[Nikli\|Nikli]], one of the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]]. When Cord believed her life to be in danger, she told Nikli that she was the daughter of [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]], the Fal‚Äôala‚Äôliki‚Äônor who drew the [[Bow of Hours\|Bow of Hours]], and that her status afforded her protection from the gods under the pact. Nikli had no idea what she was talking about, and Cord admitted to [[Rysn\|Rysn]] that the ancient pacts had involved different gods and not the Sleepless.

## Participants
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

The Unkalaki, the historic residents of the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], are the only confirmed participants in the pact. The treaty is one of multiple ancient pacts that involved the Unkalaki and their gods. Determining the other party or parties to these pacts is complicated by the fact that the Unkalaki refer to a wide range of beings as "gods", including [[Spren\|spren]], [[Unmade\|Unmade]], [[Hoid\|Hoid]], and other [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]]. The Sleepless are the only Unkalaki gods that have been ruled out of involvement in the pacts.
Lunamor related a story to [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] in which "long ago" the tana'kai of the Unkalaki approached the three strongest gods on Roshar seeking a place to settle, ultimately striking bargains that resulted in the creation of the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]] and the unique climate of the Peaks. Elements of Lunamor's story align with Cord's description of the pact of the Seven Peaks, but this connection has not been confirmed.
