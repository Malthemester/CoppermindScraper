## Appearance and Personality
Larskpur is described as a small man who "barely fit his robes". He wears a simple smock in the Pathian style.

## History
Larskpur tended to show up at community functions to represent Pathism, even though the majority of the people at the events were usually [[Church of the Survivor\|Survivorists]].
He showed up at a chapel in Elendel that had around a thousand attendees, and walked up to the dais to give a shocking speech blaspheming the [[Survivor\|Survivor]] and his actions. The attendees eventually realized that his hands were covered in blood, and he dropped a curtain to reveal the corpse of Father Bin nailed to the wall with spikes through the eyes. Larskpur slipped away while the crowd was horrified.
As [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] investigated the murder, they theorized that the [[Kandra\|kandra]] known as "Bleeder" was trying to drive a wedge between the Pathians and Survivorists. Wax later confirmed that Bleeder had posed as Larskpur and committed the murder. After escaping the chapel, Bleeder rode in a coach driven by [[Chapaou\|Chapaou]] and transformed out of her guise as Larskpur, leaving a pile of bones on the seat. She had presumably killed Larskpur at some point before her appearance in the chapel in order to use his bones to impersonate him.

## Trivia
Brandon once interacted with fan and author V. M. Jaskiernia on Reddit after reading a portion of her unpublished novel titled *Larkspur, or A Necromancer's Romance*. She received positive feedback from Brandon and later published the book, at one point accidentally spelling the title "Larskpur" in a Reddit thread. This interaction occurred before the publication of *Shadows of Self*, and it is possible that the character name Larskpur was intended as a cameo.
