**Teoras** is the capital city of [[Teod\|Teod]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. It is surrounded by forest and hosted a large sea-port.
Teoras was best known for housing the largest [[Korathi\|Korathi]] temple in Teod. However, when [[Sarene\|Sarene]] entered [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] with [[Raoden\|Raoden]] (under the guise of Spirit), she gasped at the Korathi chapel there and its beauty, saying its wall reliefs were more intricate than even Teoras's temple, which implies that perhaps Teoras's temple was only matched by the Elantrian Korathi temples. So, during the time after the [[Reod\|Reod]] and before the restoration of Elantris, Teoras's temple would have been the largest Korathi temple in the world.

>‚Äú*Spirit laughed again, leading her into a large, stately building. Sarene gasped in wonder at its beauty. It was lined with delicate, spiraled arches, and the floor was crafted of pale white marble. The wall reliefs were even more intricate than those on the Korathi temple in Teoras.*‚Äù

When [[Sarene\|Sarene]] was eleven a troop of players passed through Teoras and Sarene declared she wished to be an actress rather than a princess.
Under [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]], the [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]] attacked Teoras in the [[Battle of Teoras\|Battle of Teoras]].

## Trivia
In the original edition of Elantris, the capital of Teod was called Teoin, with Teoras being a city to its east. This was changed in the anniversary edition with references to Teoin all changed to Teoras.
