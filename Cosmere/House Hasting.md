## Keep Hasting
Keep Hasting is the location of a number of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel's]] balls. It consists of a tall, wide tower, with six other towers connecting to this central one via walltop walkways. All seven towers are decorated with curling patterns of stained glass. At the top level of the main tower is a grand ball room -- a square chamber with stained glass running around perimeter and vaulted ceilings. Guests reach this chamber through a system of skaa-operated pulley platforms. Balconies line the outside of the central tower's top level.
[[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] settles there during the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]].
