**The Highprince of Commerce** is a title bestowed by the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] king onto one of his [[Highprince\|highprinces]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is unclear if the Highprince of Commerce role existed previously when kingdom duties were split between the different highprinces. It is currently held by Highprince [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]].

## Duties
The Highprince of Commerce is responsible for securing and regulating trade throughout [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. He has the authority to patrol the trade routes and markets, establish new marketplaces, and institute laws governing them. He can set up taxes, both on trade routes and goods, is responsible for keeping track of the country's supplies and economy, and has some measure of control over the use of the crowns gemstones.

## History
In the time period between [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] unification of the country and the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] did not have a Highprince of Commerce. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] gave the role to Sebarial following the Alethi relocating to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] in an effort to turn the tower into a livable space . Sebarial was ordered to establish a new [[Breakaway\|marketplace]] and despite [[Navani\|Navani's]] wishes for an orderly and well regulated thoroughfare, Sebarial agreed to the demands of the merchants who wanted the marketplace to be larger so it would be harder to regulate and control. To help appease the merchants, as well as lower tensions, Sebarial also subsidized the price of alcohol by lowing taxes on these goods.
Sebarial also created a lucrative tax plan for movement through the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] to create revenue for the tower city and sustain its population. While Sebarial has broad authority at Urithiru, this does not stretch beyond the city and the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] war camps, as Queen [[Fen\|Fen]] of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] is made responsible for commerce in the broader alliance. This arrangement is partially to help with diplomatic relations and partially to punish Sebarial for his general attitude.
