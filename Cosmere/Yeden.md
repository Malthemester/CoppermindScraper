## Appearance and Personality
>‚Äú*Well, if you‚Äôre listing problems we‚Äôll have to overcome, you should write up there that we‚Äôre all bloody insane‚Äîthough I doubt we can fix that fact.*‚Äù
\-Yeden when planning the rebellion.[4]


Yeden is short, gangly, and has curly brown hair. He was the leader of the Skaa Rebellion. He does not like skaa thieves, especially ones that work for their own profit. He considers skaa that work on the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] armies to be traitors to the other skaa. He was originally timid, but later became more confident and civil. He is also earnest, but lacks in presence. Originally, he dressed like a skaa worker, with ash-covered clothes and a soot-stained face. He later dressed more like Kelsier: wearing a suit that didn't have soot on it. Yeden is married, but stays away to protect his family.

>‚Äú*You‚Äôre selfish, undisciplined, and you‚Äôve turned your backs on the rest of the skaa. You dress nicely, but on the inside you‚Äôre dirty as ash.*‚Äù
\-Yeden to Breeze.[2]

Yeden thinks members of the skaa underground are selfish and undisciplined, but he admits they're effective, and is willing to make use of their skills. He doesn't trust [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]], and when Kelsier lets Clubs go Yeden is worried he will bring [[Obligator\|obligators]] upon them. Yeden is skeptical of Kelsier's plan; he thinks the skaa will never rise up on the government, since the rebellion has been trying to do this for a thousand years without success.
After a time, Yeden becomes more civil with the crew and trusts Kelsier more. He starts to realize that the rebellion might actually have a chance of succeeding. After Kelsier's demonstration with [[Bilg\|Bilg]] and [[Demoux\|Demoux]], Yeden starts to believe that the army was invincible, that it couldn't fail. He is an earnest man, though he lacks in presence.

## History
### Early life
Little is known of Yeden's origins. He suceeded [[Marsh\|Marsh]] in the control of the skaa rebellion. The skaa rebellion spent years gathering the thirty thousand boxings he used to pay [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]], and before hiring Kelsier he had never seen a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], and didn't believe that skaa could be Allomancers or that Mistborn existed. He had never visited the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]].

### Contracting Kelsier's Crew
Yeden contracted [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] to provide an army to capture [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], overthrow The Final Empire, and capture [[Rashek\|The Lord Ruler]]. Yeden would pay thirty thousand boxings, half before and half after the job was done. However, it was [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] idea, and Yeden was a bit skeptical at first. He thought that the crew could never get the skaa to rise up and that it would be hard to recruit a large army from the population of Luthadel.

### At the Arguois caverns
Yeden began to get excited, and was impressed with Kelsier's work for the rebellion. He went on rallies to recruit people for the rebel army. He wanted to see the army at the Arguois Caverns, and Kelsier took him to watch over it so that [[Hammond\|Hammond]] could return to Luthadel for a while. After Kelsier's display with [[Demoux\|Demoux]], Yeden started to believe that Kelsier was able to grant his powers to others, and that their army could not possibly lose.

### The Attack to Holstep
[[Breeze\|Breeze]] was going to be sent to replace Yeden for a few months, but Yeden had already taken control of the army to gain some experience.  Yeden, confident that the rebellion was blessed by Kelsier, instructed them to attack the nearby [[Holstep\|Holstep]] Garrison in the [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]], which the Skaa rebellion defeated in a night raid. However, on the rebellion's way back to the Caverns, about an hour away from Holstep, they were attacked by the [[Valtroux\|Valtroux]] Garrison of about 5000 soldiers. Yeden and 5000 members of the Rebellion's skaa army died there, and Yeden's head was found on a spear beside the road.

## Relationships
### Kelsier
>‚Äú*It appeared that not even Yeden could resist Kelsier‚Äôs charisma for an extended period of time.*‚Äù
\-Vin thinking about Yeden[7]


In the beginning, Yeden thought [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] was a detestable thief, selfish and dishonest. He later is impressed by Kelsier, becoming more civil with him and believing that the rebellion could really succeed in overthrowing the Lord Ruler. After Kelsier's display with Demoux, Yeden was very impressed, and he was convinced that Kelsier was invincible and could pass his power to others.
