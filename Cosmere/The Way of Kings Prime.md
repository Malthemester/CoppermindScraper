## Differences from the published version
Much like the published *Way of Kings*, WoK Prime was the first book to an epic fantasy series; however, at the time, the cycle was called the "Oathshards Series".
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was known as "Merin".
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] accepts the Shards at the beginning of the novel, instead of refusing them, and the story is about him becoming a Shardbearer.
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] was known as "Jek".
[[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] was also a main viewpoint character.
[[Vasher\|Vasher]] made an appearance as an [[Ardent\|ardent]] teaching [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] under his real name rather than as Zahel.
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] did not exist. Instead, Jasnah had another red-headed apprentice, called Shinri Davar. Her plotline and character were completely different from that of Shallan, and though Shinri did eventually evolve into Shallan, Brandon considers the two to be separate characters.
[[Spren\|Spren]] were not a part of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] yet.
The [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]] was written by [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]], whose mind was destroyed by the knowledge.
Taravangian was deaf and called Ahven.
[[Ardent\|Ardents]] were called monks.
[[Adolin\|Adolin]] was called "Aredor" and was executed by Elhokar.
[[Taln\|Taln]] was a regular viewpoint character, and far saner than he appears in *Words of Radiance*. It was also unclear for much longer whether he actually was a Herald or just thought so.
The [[Herald\|Heralds]] resurrected by taking over the bodies of Rosharans, similar to how [[Fused\|Fused]] work in *The Stormlight Archive*. This fuelled the mystery of "is Taln the real deal, or is he just some crazy guy".
The Heralds had the ability to sense other [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]] by holding their own, though Taln initially assumed it was an ability to sense each other. In one of the scenes of the original draft, he used this to try and track down his fellow Heralds, only to find the abandoned Blades.
Dalinar's name was spelt Dalenar
Shardplate is said to be made by Awakeners which are different from Nalthian [[Awakening\|Awakeners]] and the equivalent of [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]].
All but one of the Heralds were male.
[[Lhan\|Lhan]] was a viewpoint character, though he was more similar in character to [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] than his in-world counterpart.
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] was not a part of the story.
The [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] were intact.
[[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] was killed by Dalinar.
## Trivia
A sequence of six chapters from *The Way of Kings* Prime is included in the .
[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] was the first character Brandon Sanderson ever wrote when he was 15 years old. What he originally had in mind was a king (Elhokar) who is terrible at leading and the King's uncle not knowing whether to take charge or not.
