*Nightblood* is the working title for the sequel to [[Warbreaker\|Warbreaker]]. It is currently on hold, and probably the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] book most in jeopardy of not being written. It definitely will not be written until [[Stormlight Archive\|Stormlight Archive]] 5 and Mistborn Era 2 are done, and may have to wait for the [[Elantris trilogy\|Elantris trilogy]], Mistborn Era 3, and possibly Stormlight Archive 6 to be written, as those projects are consuming much of Brandon's time.
At one point, Brandon was planning on publicly releasing drafts as he wrote, as he did with Warbreaker, though it is unclear if that is still the case.
It will not feature all the characters from Warbreaker; the original plan was to center the story on [[Vasher\|Vasher]], [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]], [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] and further develop their characters. Characters like [[Susebron\|Susebron]] and [[Sisirinah\|Siri]] may get some updates, but would not be the focus of the book. Brandon also plans to introduce new characters; a recent outline also includes a married couple that, for political reasons, acts like they hate each other.
The book would focus heavily on story of the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]], including how Vasher became cosmere aware and travelled to Roshar, as well as his history with Denth. Vasher and Vivenna would be attempting to stop [[Yesteel\|Yesteel]], who recently learned how to create [[Awakening\|Awakened]] [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and attempted to start a second [[Manywar\|Manywar]]. [[Jewels\|Jewels]] and [[Clod\|Clod]] might join him, while [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]] could feature, but would likely go in his own direction.
There are several questions about Nalthis and its magic that Brandon has mentioned addressing in the book, including the origin of the [[Idrian\|Idrian]] royal family, how other regions of Nalthis interact with Returned, and how Vasher suppressed his divine Breath.
Chronologically, it should be the cosmere book that immediately precedes [[The Way of Kings\|The Way of Kings]] and should help explain how Nightblood got to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], though Vasher's arrival on Roshar will occur between this book and The Way of Kings.
