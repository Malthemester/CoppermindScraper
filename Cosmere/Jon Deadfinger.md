**Jon Deadfinger** is a lawman from [[Far Dorest\|Far Dorest]] in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance Personality
Deadfinger is a hard man, willing to beat a confession out of his suspects.

## History
Jon Deadfinger worked as a lawman before [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] went to the Roughs. However, as a lone lawman in a town with a high population, his influence did not extend far beyond the borders of Far Dorest. Deadfinger was too busy handling problems in his own town to do much work outside of it. When Wax was first learning to be a lawman, Jon Deadfinger mentored him and taught him the basics.
Deadfinger was the lawman who easily caught a sixteen year-old [[Wayne\|Wayne]] after Wayne inadvertently killed the innocent man he had been trying to rob. Deadfinger and Wax found him hiding underneath a crawlspace of a house. Jon dragged Wayne out of the crawl space while Wayne complained of a sound of gunfire only he could hear.
For a few years after Wax departed to be the lawman of [[Weathering\|Weathering]], Deadfinger, Wax, and [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] had a sort of lawkeeper's alliance, but this eventually seems to have fallen apart.
