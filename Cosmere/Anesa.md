**Anesa** is a [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] attendant of [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin's]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
On the day the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] army leaves Urithiru for [[Azir\|Azir]] and eventually [[Emul\|Emul]], Anesa goes over several reports on the state of the city with Navani on the way to the atrium. There, Anesa accompanies Navani as she inspects a hidden room that one of her scholars discovered and to which a [[Stoneward\|Stoneward]] has recently created access. Though Navani has no answer for her regarding why the room would be sealed off, [[Falilar\|Falilar]] promises to investigate the gemstone hidden in the stone of the doorway to see if it is a [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] of some sort.
