**I-nah** are a type of tree native to the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Habitat
The i-nah grow along the bottom of the Reshi Sea and are dozens of feet tall, with bark that is made of stone. The branches of the i-nah occasionally break the surface of the sea, but many are submerged just beneath the seawater.
As the branches are stone, they form shoals, which can easily slice the hulls of the longboats common in the Reshi Sea. Guides such as [[Gu\|Gu]] are used to navigate around them, and even know how to steer clear of the underwater branches which are almost invisible from above the surface of the sea.

## Trivia
I-nah means bad in the language of the Reshi.
