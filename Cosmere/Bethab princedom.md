[[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] forces stop in Dumadari on their way to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] after the formation of the [[Vengeance Pact\|Vengeance Pact]] before sailing on to [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]]. Dalinar used the voyage as a cover to travel to the [[Valley\|Valley]] and seek the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]].
[[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] was in residence in Dumadari for an unknown amount of time in 1173. [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] travelled to the city to meet with the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] princess, however, by the time she arrived Jasnah had moved on.

## Politics
Brightlord [[Bethab\|Bethab]] is the current Highprince of this princedom. He has, on several occasions, when negotiating business contracts with the king, included language that would favor him for succession of the throne. [[Mishinah Bethab\|Mishinah Bethab]], the Highprince's wife, is also highly involved in Alethi politics and will represent his interests on occasion.
The Bethab army is made up predominately of mercenary companies.
It is implied that Dumadari is not well protected from raids via Mevan Bay.
