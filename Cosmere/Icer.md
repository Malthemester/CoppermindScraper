## Appearance & Personality
In her unembodied form, Icer is completely invisible to the living. To other poltergeists she appears as a glowing field seeping over surfaces. When in possession of a living body, she looks and sounds like the person she is possessing, including their accent and some of their mannerisms. In this state she can be recognized by other poltergeists as one of their kind due to a bright yellow-colored glow visible around her form.
She has a somewhat confrontational attitude.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a poltergeist, Icer must possess the body of a living person in order to maintain consciousness. When possessing a body, she gains full control over the person and can even access certain skills for a limited time. If the body she is possessing is killed, she is forcefully ejected and becomes a mindless, primal unembodied spirit, desperate for warmth until she finds and takes over a new body. She can also [[Bolting\|Bolt]] from one body to another if she makes physical contact with the new body.

## History
At some point, Icer was a living woman. She died at an unknown point and under unknown circumstances and became a poltergeist.
Icer met fellow poltergeists [[Dreamer (character)\|Dreamer]], [[Phi\|Phi]], [[Longshot\|Longshot]], [[Rabies\|Rabies]], and [[TheGannon\|TheGannon]], who all love to play games. As a group, they got together often to play games by possessing the living and using their bodies disposably, as if they were players inhabiting the persona of a video game character.
During one such game, Icer was playing cops and robbers in Manhattan against Phi, on a team with the other four poltergeists in their group. Icer was assigned to hunt Phi on the streets, along with Dreamer and Rabies. After Dreamer had a skirmish with Phi, Icer decided to get a better vantage point on top of a building. From there, she spotted Phi and moved to intercept him. By the time Dreamer reached their location, Phi had already killed the body Icer was using. This was the third body Icer had used for the game, which meant she was knocked out of the game. At the conclusion of the game, Icer chatted with her fellow players, challenged Phi on his interpretation of the rules, and lamented inviting TheGannon to play with them.
