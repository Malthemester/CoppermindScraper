**Peg** is a [[Tenasi\|tenasi]] pirate in the [[Belt\|belt]] of the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]]. She is the mother of [[Gremm\|Gremm]] and [[Semm\|Semm]].

## History
Peg was the chief security officer at the Superiority base of [[Surehold\|Surehold]]. Peg was the one who installed the nonlethal weapons on the Superiority ships, saying that they couldn’t afford to throw away the ships that had been stolen by pirates. She also didn’t want to have to kill people who she sympathized with. The Superiority treated her poorly, and didn’t allow her children to leave with her when her time on the base was up. Peg was angry, and defected, along with about a third of the people in the base. She almost got the entire base to revolt, but others were scared of the Superiority’s reprisal. Peg and her fellow dissidents left to start pirate factions. There weren’t many at the time, but they grew greatly with the new members. Both of Peg’s sons left her to start their own factions, but some, like [[Shiver\|Shiver]] and [[RayZed\|RayZed]], stayed with Peg.
