**Dob** is an elderly stable hand at [[Silence's waystop\|Silence's waystop]] in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].
Dob takes care of the horses of people who stay at the waystop. He is under standing orders to leave watering for last, in case Silence wants to add [[Wetleek\|wetleek]] sap to their water in order to track bounties. He sleeps in the stable with the horses.
Dob has worked at the waystop since before [[William Montane\|William Montane's]] death; he is a loyal man. However, Dob is not terribly intelligent, and [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]] thinks that he has no idea that she is the White Fox. On the contrary, Dob is fully aware of her secret identity. When Silence returns from hunting [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]], carrying [[William Ann\|William Ann]], both injured from the withering touch of shades, Dob pours silver dust on the two of them to save their lives.
After his chores are done, Dob likes to smoke his pipe on the waystop's porch.
