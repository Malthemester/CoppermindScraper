## Appearance and Personality
Ithi is a middle-aged or elderly woman. As a result of being a Soulcasting [[Savant\|savant]], she has vines seemingly growing underneath her skin, out of her eyes, and down her face. She wears a Soulcasting [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] on her hand that is powered by [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] contained in large emeralds. Like most [[Alethi\|Alethi]] Soulcasters, she is an [[Ardent\|ardent]] of the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] church.

## Abilities
Ithi is skilled in the use of her Soulcaster fabrial. Although she and her sister are not powerful enough to feed the entire city, they are able to keep the entire Wall Guard supplied with plenty of food, with "some to spare". She shares the fabrial with her sister and they are therefore able to keep Soulcasting "nonstop".

## History
During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], Highmarshal [[Azure\|Azure]] led the [[Kholinar Wall Guard\|Kholinar Wall Guard]] in defending the city against the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]. Food was very scarce in the city during the siege; the Voidbringers intentionally allowed refugees from the surrounding areas to enter the city and drain its resources. Under normal circumstances, the city's Soulcasters would have been able to make Soulcast food to sustain the populace for quite some time, but the invading army controlled [[Voidspren\|Voidspren]] known as "screamers" that could detect most uses of Stormlight, including fabrials, and alert the [[Fused\|Fused]].
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] noticed that Azure seemed to control an unusual amount of food, and even used it to recruit people into her army. Azure eventually revealed a hidden series of chambers in the walls of the city. Azure entered the tunnels every night to cut out blocks of stone with her [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] that Ithi and her sister would Soulcast into food. They avoided detection by the screamers by lining the room with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] panels given to Azure by [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
