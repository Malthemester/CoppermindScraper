\-Thresh greeting Vstim[1]

**Thresh-son-Esan** is a [[Shin\|Shin]] trader in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. He has a longstanding friendship and bond of trust with the [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] merchant [[Vstim\|Vstim]].

## Appearance
As a trader, Thresh is privileged enough in Shin society to wear a colorful cape with his shirt and trousers, unlike warriors and workers who must wear basic brown clothing.

## History
Thresh' Shin-style full name indicates that his father was a man named Esan.
Thresh regularly traded with people from other countries, and can even speak in Thaylen. These dealings with foreigners were overseen by one of the farmers, who are high-ranking members of Shin society.
In exchange for [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] scrap metal, he often traded chickens, cloth, and exotic dried meats to Vstim. [[Rysn\|Rysn]] noticed as she observed one of these dealings that Thresh used humility instead of boasting as a form of haggling, downplaying the importance of his wares and expecting the other side to do the same. Vstim confirmed that this was typical of Shin traders.
Nearly seven years prior to Rysn's visit to Shinovar, Thresh gave a [[Truthless\|Truthless]] man to Vstim. The Thaylen merchant insisted on paying for the slave, but afterwards Thresh had to throw the money away as Shin were not allowed to accept money for Truthless, who were shunned by Shin society. That Truthless was [[Szeth\|Szeth]], who was later sold to the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] and became known as the Assassin in White.
