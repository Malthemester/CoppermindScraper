**Kai-garnis** is a [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]] involved in the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
She awakened from the bay in the midst of the [[Singer\|singer]] army before the battle by sinking into the stone and becoming it, before ripping herself out of the ground. [[Odium\|Odium]] later complimented her on the destruction of part of the outer wall and tasked her with taking the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] if the [[Tisark\|Tisark]] couldn't destroy it. [[Hrdalm\|Hrdalm]] and [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] attacked her, but were unable to do serious damage. When [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]] arrived, however, Kai-garnis appeared to be scared of him. Renarin convinced Adolin to stand down, as he did not have his [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] at the time, so Adolin lent [[Mayalaran\|Maya]] to Hrdlam; Renarin and Hrdlam then continued the attack and managed to cut off Kai-garnis' legs and arms. Once she was immobilized, Renarin approached and drew in a large amount of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], which caused Kai-garnis to flee from the stone.
