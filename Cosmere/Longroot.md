## Description
Longroots are, as their name suggests, a type of long tuber that contains a sticky sap. They grow in cracks in the rock where stormwater collects. As a result, longroots are covered in dirt and [[Crem\|crem]] from the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] when they are harvested. They are brown in color.

## Culinary Use
Longroots are easy to grow and are cultivated and eaten in many regions of Roshar. They are not known for their taste, which is faintly reminiscent of minerals. Longroots are cheap, and are often eaten only when alternatives are not readily available. Since they are tubers, they have a long shelf life; they can be boxed and put into storage and can be transported by caravan.
Longroots are technically edible when raw but are usually cooked for a long time, commonly as an ingredient in stew. The roots are peeled and cut into chunks before stewing. [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] experiments with longroot stew on multiple occasions, including a version with shelled finger crab meat.

## History
Longroots have been seen as a foodstuff in a number of locations across the Rosharan continent, including the warcamps at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], [[Narak\|Narak]], [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]], rural [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], and the [[Rockfall\|Rockfall]] mansion in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] family was struggling to get by due to [[Roshone\|Roshone's]] hostility, they ate longroots and other food donated secretly by the townspeople of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. [[Hesina\|Hesina]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] peeled longroots while they discussed [[Spren\|spren]] with [[Tien\|Tien]].
