## Appearance and Personality
Australia is sixteen years old when she first meets Alcatraz. She is described as plump, with the tan skin, dark hair, and brown eyes typical of the [[Mokia\|Mokian]] people.
Australia is immediately friendly towards Alcatraz, and also appears to be somewhat absent-minded. She is for the most part cheerful and optimistic, but a little insecure and good at hiding her negative emotions.

## Attributes and Abilities
Australia has the ability to wake up looking really ugly. If she falls asleep thinking about a certain person, she can wake up looking exactly like that person, though the effect seems to wear off fairly quickly. She is also able to use her talent to impersonate non-human creatures. She can fall asleep very quickly, at will - during the infiltration of the [[Library of Alexandria\|Library of Alexandria]] she is able to force herself to fall asleep within the space of five minutes.
In addition to her Talent, Australia has two other significant abilities: She is an Oculator (though unpracticed and only able to effectively use simple [[Lens\|Lenses]]) and a capable pilot.

## Trivia
Her name is a reference to how the continent of Australia was first colonized by the British as a  in the 1700's.
