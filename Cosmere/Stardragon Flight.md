**Stardragon Flight** is a full [[DDF\|DDF]] Flight. The flight is named after a [[Stardragon\|potentially fictitious species]] that is known to the peoples of [[Detritus\|Detritus]].

## History
The flight participated in the [[Battle of Alta Second\|Battle of Alta Second]] and provided cover to try and drive the [[Varvax\|Krell]] away from the falling shipyard. The flightleader of Valkyrie Flight died during the battle and the remaining flight members were absorbed immediately into a different flight.
[[Kimmalyn\|Kimmalyn]] and [[Spensa\|Spensa]] hid from two of the flight members when attempting to sneak Spensa into the female [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] dorm room. When [[Alanik\|Alanik]] and [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] fled Detritus against [[Jeshua Weight\|Jeshua Weight]]’s orders, trying to go to [[ReDawn (planet)\|ReDawn]], Stardragon Flight launched to chase after them. [[Robin\|Robin]], a member of the flight, waited on orders from [[Jeshua Weight\|Jeshua Weight]] before attacking, and Alanik hyperjumped Skyward Flight safely away.
Members of Stardragon Flight were involved with the [[Taynix\|taynix]] program, and worked on new keywords with the slugs with [[Freyja Marten\|FM]]’s help. When [[Superiority\|Superiority]] forces attacked the planet [[Evershore (planet)\|Evershore]], Stardragon Flight was one of the flights called into action to protect the planet, alongside [[Ivy Flight\|Ivy Flight]] and [[Victory Flight\|Victory Flight]]. Stardragon Flight had one taynix, which they used to hyperjump themselves to Evershore. Stardragon Flight and Ivy Flight were assigned by Jorgen to protect the city of [[Dreamspring\|Dreamspring]], intercepting enemy fighters before they got within firing range of the city. At least one member of the flight was shot down during the ensuing fight, when a Superiority [[Cytonics\|cytonic]] used mindblades during combat.
