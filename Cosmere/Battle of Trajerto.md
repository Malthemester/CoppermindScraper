The **Battle of Trajerto** is a skirmish between the [[DDF\|DDF]] and [[Varvax\|Krell]] on [[Detritus\|Detritus]].
Five years prior to [[Spensa\|Spensa]] joining [[Flight School\|Flight School]], a Krell flight infiltrated DDF airspace and destroyed the smaller anti-air defences. Two DDF [[Scout\|scouts]] successfully destroyed the [[Lifebuster\|lifebuster]] before it reached [[Alta\|Alta]], however the DDF came close to losing the base.
During [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] [[Flight School\|Flight School]] training, [[Arturo\|Arturo]] recognizes that [[Cobb\|Cobb]] used a modified recording of the battle as a simulation. Cobb mentions that he wouldn't have time simulating completely fresh scenarios, hinting that other historical battle recordings are used in the simulator.
