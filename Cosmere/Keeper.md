The **Keepers** of [[Terris\|Terris]] are the major branch of [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. Ruled over by the [[Synod\|Synod]], they copied the practices of the [[Worldbringer\|Worldbringers]] of old in collecting as much information as possible in their [[Metalmind\|metalminds]]. They tried to stay secret from the world, and the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], who would have them killed for their Feruchemical abilities.
The Keepers amassed knowledge of Scadrial from before the Lord Ruler and the advent of the Final Empire, in the hope of restoring to the people the knowledge and heritage they had lost after Rashek took over the world.
Each Keeper has access to all the stored knowledge of their order, and periodically returns to [[Tathingdwen\|Tathingdwen]], the capital of [[Terris Dominance\|Terris Dominance]], to update their copperminds. Also, each Keeper has a particular area of expertise, such as religions or ancient kings and leaders.
