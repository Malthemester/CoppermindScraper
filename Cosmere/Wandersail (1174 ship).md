## Ship
The ship itself is built for speed from light (but strong) [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] wood, and supposedly among the best in the fleet. Various fabrial technological additions work to increase the ship's stability, Fabrial pumps are used to keep the ship bailed no matter how much water washes onto the deck, and attractor fabrials within the hull shift weights around to keep the ship from capsizing. Offensively, the ship has ballistae with attached firepods, and the ability to quickly drop sails and maneuver via oars if attacked.

## Crew
The ship is primarily owned by [[Rysn\|Rysn]], shown by a writ of ownership and a captain's cord, but partially owned by [[Vstim\|Vstim]] and other investors. The captain is [[Drlwan\|Drlwan]], whose brother [[Kstled\|Kstled]] is the man-at-arms; both positions are traditionally female. The crew, though not Rysn, are superstious and believe in the Passions to some extent. In order to maintain crew numbers, some members are held underdeck during storms in expectation of having to replace some losses.

## History
Vstim had the *Wandersail* built in the shipyards of [[Klna City\|Klna City]], which sheltered the ship from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. It was engineered with high-tech [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] which provide greater stability during storms.
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Vstim gave his fleet of merchant ships to Queen [[Fen\|Fen]] for the defense of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] from an imminent invasion, however he reserved the *Wandersail*. On the day of the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Vstim offered the deed of the ship to his former pupil [[Rysn\|Rysn]], along with a captain's cord and a promise to finance her first expedition. Rysn initially turned the gift down, however, she reconsidered after surviving the attack on the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]].
Within a few months after the attack, [[Rysn\|Rysn]] took the *Wandersail* on an [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]] in order to investigate the loss of the crewmembers of *First Dreams* and locate the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. Following this, some of the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] maintain watch on Rysn, and by extension, the ship.

## Trivia
Currently has no ship's pet, as the previous one was killed by the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]], Chiri-Chiri, in following Rysn, may now fill this niche.
