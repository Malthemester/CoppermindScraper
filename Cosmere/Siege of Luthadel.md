The **siege of Luthadel** was a major event following the end of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The armies of [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]], [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]], and the [[Koloss\|Koloss]] army of [[Jastes Lekal\|Jastes Lekal]] besieged [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], King [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture's]] throne. Originally, Straff Venture's numerically superior force was poised to take control of the city, leading to some diplomatic overtures between Cett and Elend in response. However, this balance was upset by the entry of the Koloss army, with the potential to defeat any of the human armies present. Elend was deposed and the city raised [[Ferson Penrod\|Ferson Penrod]] to be king. [[Vin\|Vin]] intimidated the opposition through the use of [[Duralumin\|duralumin]]-enhanced emotional [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] upon Venture and an assault upon Cett's force within Luthadel's walls. However, Vin's apparent need to seek the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] and save Scadrial from the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] led her to leave the city, accompanied by Elend and [[Spook\|Spook]], on a journey to [[Terris\|Terris]] before the battle for the city began.
The [[Battle of Luthadel\|Battle of Luthadel]] was triggered by the lack of control that Lekal held over his Koloss force, who attacked the city of their own accord. The Koloss force successfully breached the city walls, which, punctuated by so many gates, were difficult for the defenders to hold. During this assault, [[Dockson\|Dockson]], [[Clubs\|Clubs]] and [[Tindwyl\|Tindwyl]] were all killed by the Koloss.
Upon realising that the well was in Luthadel and that she, Elend and Spook were sent away for their own safety, Vin returned to the city and took control of the [[Koloss\|Koloss]] using emotional Allomancy. Her swift execution of Straff Venture and her control over the Koloss army allowed Elend to retake control of Luthadel and be crowned Emperor of the [[New Empire\|New Empire]].
