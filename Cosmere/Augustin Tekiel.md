Lord **Augustin Tekiel** is a prominent member of [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Augustin Tekiel began a smuggling operation in order to avoid taxes on [[Aluminum\|aluminum]]. He claimed aluminum was other goods, such as wool, with the help of railway workers. This scam was successful and profitable for around two years. However, [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] and his crew of thieves, the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]], somehow discovered Tekiel's fraud, possibly on the advice of the [[Set\|Set]]. Miles and his Vanishers robbed a train carrying one of these fraudulent shipments in order to get enough aluminum for their weapons and to finance themselves.
Augustin Tekiel feared that if he drew too much attention to the theft, his criminal activity would be discovered. As a result, he waited three months before he began to make a commotion about the robbery. He wrote a public letter slamming the city constables as incompetent because they had failed to stop the crime or recover his goods. The letter was printed in several broadsheets, likely including the [[Elendel Daily\|Elendel Daily]].
Lord [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] uncovered this crime via logical deduction while studying the Vanisher robberies.
