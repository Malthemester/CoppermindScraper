**Matain** is an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Stormwarden\|stormwarden]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who serves under King [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]].

## History
He was among the scholars that accompanied Gavilar on his early expeditions to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in 1166. He was trusted by Gavilar, and acted as an advisor.
He dictated an account of one of the first encounters with the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. He had been skeptical about initial sightings of "wild" [[Parshmen\|parshmen]] by [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] scouting group, and was stunned when several individuals appeared at Gavilar's camp. He provided a physical description of the Parshendi, including their weapons and clothing. Gavilar tasked him with investigating their language, society, and music. Matain still thought they might be a hoax, but was forced to acknowledge their authenticity after learning more about their culture. Matain's account of Gavilar's sudden scholarly interest in the Parshendi was not an embellishment, according to [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]].
He continued to serve House Kholin as a stormwarden after Gavilar's death; he was present at the experiment of the floating platforms that [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] conducted in the Kholin warcamp prior to the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]].
