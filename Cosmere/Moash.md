## Appearance and Personality
 by  taratjah 
For more images, see [[Moash/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Moash is lean, though strong, with a narrow face and brown hair speckled with black. He's born [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]], with brown eyes which turn tan after he receives a full set of Shards.
Moash is vindictive and largely opposed to any sort of order, though once he does warm up to someone, he gets attached extremely quickly. Once he joins a group, he's friendly and amicable, and often the driving force behind their more relaxing, off-duty activities. He values his friendships, and tries to salvage them when he can. He's eager to gain power, and very starry-eyed over those who do have it. At the same time, he's highly suspicious of those above him in the social order. He has a strong sense of justice, though it only comes forth on some occasions.
On the other hand, Moash has very little sense of responsibility; to him, nothing is ever his fault, and his decisions, to his eyes, are always motivated by some external factor, whether it be actions of other people or the society at large. He does have some moments of insight when he acknowledges that what he did was wrong; however, those become more and more rare as he becomes involved in the Fused army.
His need to get revenge, first on [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], then on all [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]], consumes him and pushes him further and further away from friends and into the waiting arms of the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]], even as he claims to still be following his ideals. Eventually, as he gives in completely, he seems to lose any drive altogether, feeling no emotions even as he accomplishes his vengeance. At this point, he's a full devotee of the Fused and Odium's philosophy, seeking out passion and obeying their orders. Although he continues to care for Kaladin, he thinks that suicide is the only way, short of joining Odium, that Kaladin can be happy, and also cares more about proving that he is right and Kaladin is wrong, instead of caring about his past friendships.

## Abilities and Attributes
Moash is a skilled spearman, enough so to kill an attacking [[Fused\|Fused]]. For a time, he also has a set of [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], and though he does have some training with them, he's not particularly good with them and still defaults to the spear when his life is on the line. Eventually, he's given [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], granting him control over the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]] and [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]]. He appears to be natural at using it, as it takes him no time at all to drink in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and use Lashings.
He's also a decent spear teacher and commander, able to train a group of [[Singer\|singers]] before the attack on [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].

## History
### Early Life
Both of Moash's parents died when he was a child. He was raised by his grandparents, who both worked as silversmiths in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. It was his grandfather who named him. Later, Moash would discover that he has the same name as an ancient [[Singer\|singer]] of some renown, although it is unknown whether his grandfather was aware of this.
Moash chose not to enter the family business, preferring jobs that involved traveling. While he was working on a caravan for a few months, his grandparents became victims in the Roshone Affair that led to them dying while incarcerated in the palace dungeons. Moash ultimately blamed [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]], who was then a royal prince but would later become the king of Alethkar, for their deaths.

### Bridge Four
Moash joined the war assuming he would be made a spearman but ended up in Bridge Four. When Bridge Four started training down in the chasms, Moash was one of the first who changed into a fighting man. Later, on the bridgerun where [[Dunny\|Dunny]] died, Moash probably saved Kaladin's life by keeping him from reaching Dunny's body and later told Kaladin that he was wrong about him.

 by  Nick Vidic 
When [[Adolin\|Adolin]] tried to give [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] the gift of [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], Kaladin instead gave them to Moash, thereby making him a lighteyes in rank. His eyes started to lighten a week after, though he still did not consider himself lighteyes.

### Attempted Regicide and Desertion
>**Kaladin**: "*Sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good.*"**Moash**: "*Exactly!*"**Kaladin**: "*That's what Amaram said. In regards to my men, whom he killed to cover up his theft.*"
\-Kaladin: "Sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good."
Moash: "Exactly!"
Kaladin: "That's what Amaram said. In regards to my men, whom he killed to cover up his theft."


Moash became involved in a plot with [[Graves\|Graves]] to assassinate King Elhokar Kholin, which was ultimately thwarted by Kaladin. Moash took his Plate and Blade and fled the warcamps with Graves after their failed attempt.
They head out into the wilderness with a caravan of stolen goods. Graves intended to introduce Moash to the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]], hoping that bringing back a full Shardbearer could compensate for his plan's failure. A short while into the trip, they were attacked by a group of [[Fused\|Fused]]. Graves was killed, and Moash attempted to fight with his Shardblade, but deemed it too unwieldy. He got hold of a spear and was able to kill one of the Fused.
Upon seeing this, the other Fused considered Moash to have enough "passion" to earn their respect, and gave him the choice between death and slavery. He chose slavery, gave up his Shards and his other weapons, and went with them.

### Servant of the Fused
As a slave, he pulled supply sledges across the country. On one of his routes, he saw a group of singers pulling sledges like the other slaves. He stood up for the group, gaining more respect among the Fused and the singers. Eventually, he joined the assault on Kholinar as a warrior for the Fused's army.
In Kholinar, he and his singer companions fought with Kholinar's Wall Guard. At the climax of the fight, Moash found his way to King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], and stabbed him through the chest. He then stabbed the king again in the eye, just before Elhokar could finish swearing the First Ideal. His vengeance fulfilled, he looked up to see Kaladin, who was in Kholinar with the king on a mission to save the city. Moash saluted his former captain, who had frozen in shock at what happened, and left.

Following the siege, he was put to work as a laborer clearing out the debris. There he was approached by a Fused, [[Hnanan\|Hnanan]], who gave him a [[Vyre's knife\|bright golden knife]] with a sapphire attached to it. The Fused then sent him to assassinate the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]], whom he killed with the knife. Some time after the successful assassination, the Fused, [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]], offered Moash Jezrien's [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] as well as a new identity. He accepted, took the singer name **Vyre**, which meant *He Who Quiets*, and used the Honorblade to join the Fused in the air.
A year later, Moash took part in the Fused assault on Hearthstone, where he murdered Roshone in front of Kaladin, who went into a state of battle shock. Moash then attempted to persuade Kaladin to commit suicide. He was stopped by Renarin, who showed Moash a vision of the man he could have been had he not betrayed Bridge Four, a Windrunner of the Third Ideal, causing Moash to flee.
In Kholinar, he sat in on a session of the Nine, where he warns them that Kaladin will foil their plan to occupy Urithiru. Later, he was approached by Odium, who intended to break Kaladin and questioned Moash on the best ways of tormenting his former captain.

### The Occupation of Urithiru
>**Moash**: "*I am unchained.*"**Odium**: "*And yet, you think so often of Kaladin.*"**Moash**: "*I am … mostly unchained.*"
\-Moash: "I am unchained."
Odium: "And yet, you think so often of Kaladin."
Moash: "I am … mostly unchained."


During the occupation of Urithiru, Vyre used his Honorblade to operate the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] between Kholinar and the tower for the [[Fused\|Fused]]. When the uprising to take Urithiru back began, he set a trap for Kaladin in his family's clinic, but the trap was instead sprung by [[Teft\|Teft]] and [[Lift\|Lift]]. Moash injured Lift, then used a [[Raysium\|raysium]] dagger containing [[Anti-Stormlight\|anti-Stormlight]] to permanently kill Teft's spren, [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]], before killing Teft. He handed [[Lirin\|Lirin]] to the Fused as insurance against Kaladin, ordering them to kill Lirin in front of his son should Kaladin fight back.
Moash then descended to the basement of Urithiru to kill Queen [[Navani\|Navani]]. Nearly succeeding, he was ambushed by an injured [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]], which gave Navani time to bond the [[Sibling\|Sibling]]. After restoring the tower, she used its Light to incapacitate Moash and forcibly return his pain to him. Moash fled, hating himself for what he had done to Teft and realizing that he did not truly regret the murder, only the guilt. He eventually broke his spine in a fall and nearly died before being rescued by a few Heavenly Ones and given Stormlight. When he recovered, he found that he was blind.

## Trivia
Though Moash's name is similar to [[Moshe Feder\|Moshe Feder]] (Brandon's editor) it is not actually a cameo.
Moash's eye color is initially (and erroneously) written as dark green in *The Way of Kings*. In *Words of Radiance*, his eyes are said to be brown. Peter Ahlstrom has confirmed that Moash's eyes are brown and that the first book is incorrect.
The name Moash was originally a singer name.
Moash's use of [[Sand (Taldain)\|white sand]] when seeking and killing Phendorana implies that a Cosmere-aware worldhopper is working for or supplying Odium's forces with materials from other Invested worlds.
Had he not begun killing for Odium, Moash could have become a Windrunner of at least the Third Ideal.
Brandon does not enjoy writing Moash.
