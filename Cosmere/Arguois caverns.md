The **Arguois caverns** were a system of caves in the [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The caverns were used by the [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebellion]] to house and train their armies. Skaa rebels and refugees went there to hide, as did the skaa from [[Tresting plantation\|Tresting plantation]] after [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] killed [[Themos Tresting\|Themos Tresting]]. Later on, when Kelsier raised an army for the skaa rebellion to overthrow The Lord Ruler, those men, too, went to the Arguois Caverns to hide and train to become soldiers. Kelsier visited the skaa rebels there.
They are thought to be located between near the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] and the [[Kandra Homeland\|kandra Homeland]].
They were used during [[Sazed\|Sazed's]] [[Harmony\|ascension]] as a place of safety, similar to the storage caches [[Rashek\|Rashek]] left under the control of the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]].
