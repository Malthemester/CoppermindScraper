>“*I speak of us as "we." The group. Those of us who were trying to discover and defeat Ruin. Perhaps my thoughts are now tainted, but I like to look back and see the sum of what we were doing as a single, united assault, though we were all involved in different processes and plans.*”
\-Sazed's reflections[1]

## History
They were the group that, due to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] will for vengeance, planned to kill and overthrow the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. Afterward, upon the release of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] from his imprisonment at [[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]], the group fought and destroyed Ruin. One notable member of the group, [[Sazed\|Sazed]], took up both the power of Ruin and of [[Preservation\|Preservation]], started the [[Catacendre\|re-creation of the planet]] and saved the population of Scadrial.
Some of the Preservers might be alive circa 300 years post-Catacendre, but all of them are now part of the mythology of northern Scadrial.
