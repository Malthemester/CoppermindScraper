## Appearance and Personality
Lhan is a round man with green eyes. He is a selfish and self-centered ardent to the [[Aesudan\|queen]] who loves the ease of the life that he has been given, even though he sees the hypocrisy of it. He does as little work as he can and eats as much as he can. He sees no problem with the amount of food that goes to waste in [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]], or that people in the kingdom are poor and starving. Though many ardents write poetry about the queen, Lhan feels that this resembles work far too much and never does so.

## History
Some time during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Lhan was assigned to show [[Pai\|Pai]] around the queen's palace in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. He explained to her that the queen gave her ardents easy lives because she feared that the Almighty was displeased with her. He tried to show Pai all the wonderful luxuries of the palace but did not succeed in making her happy about any of it. He was horrified the next morning when he saw her graffiti describing how the queen resembled each of the [[Ten fools\|ten fools]].

\-Kharat to Shallan[1]

During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], Lhan succumbed to [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]] and became known as Kharat. He introduced [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to the revel; calling her Kishi, he kept her in the outer ring of the revel and told her she couldn't go inside. He ate sweets and plied Shallan with wine. Insisting that he was to keep watch on Shallan, Kharat sat outside her door when she found an empty room in a nearby building and told him she needed some time to herself. [[Pattern\|Pattern]] snuck into the hallway and repeated the whispers they had heard from Ashertmarn, enticing Kharat to go back outside to look for a drink. He came back in and settled down in the hallway again, unaware that he was now guarding an illusion of Veil and that Shallan had walked right by him wearing a new face.

## Trivia
According to [[Peter Ahlstrom\|Peter]], he is probably unrelated to [[Barlesha Lhan\|Barlesha Lhan]].
Lhan is a viewpoint character in *The Way of Kings Prime* whose storyline is intertwined with that of [[Taln\|Taln]]. Since [[Taln\|Taln's]] story has been postponed to the latter half of [[The Stormlight Archive\|The Stormlight Archive]], Lhan is featured in an interlude in [[Words of Radiance\|Words of Radiance]] instead.
