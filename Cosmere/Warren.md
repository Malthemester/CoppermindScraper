## History
>‚Äú*This is a test of martial competence. We must train to fight, if the Desolation truly has begun.*‚Äù
\-Warren leading a group of Skybreaker squires in a test[2]

Warren, along with [[Ki\|Ki]], traveled from the Skybreaker fortress with [[Szeth\|Szeth]] and twenty other Skybreaker squires to a testing ground on the Purelake. He announced a test of martial competence where the Skybreaker hopefuls, using their [[Lashing\|Lashings]], had to fight by throwing colored bags of powder at each other within a contest area marked by wooden poles. He explained that no other weapons were allowed and the winner would be the squire with the cleanest uniform at the end of the test. When the sun had gone down he shouted an end to the test. Szeth showed great skill with his Lashings and ultimately won the test by exploiting a loophole--washing his uniform prior to the end. Warren and Ki concluded that he was beyond the skill of the other squires. Warren told Szeth he should have his own [[Spren\|spren]] soon.
Warren accompanied [[Nale\|Nale]], Szeth, and most of the other Skybreakers on their journey to [[Marat\|Marat]], flying southward for three days. Upon their arrival in [[Marat\|Marat]], he landed and conferred briefly with Nale and the other masters before flying to a nearby town with all the Skybreakers except for Szeth and Nale.
