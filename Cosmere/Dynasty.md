The **Dynasty** is an empire that spans multiple nations on the Darkside of [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
The Dynasty exerts a great deal of control over the entirety of Darkside, to the point that Dynastic is the first language of all Darksiders. The current ruler of the Dynasty, Emperor [[Skathan\|Skathan]], intentionally impedes the spread of technology and knowledge between provinces of the Dynasty in order to maintain dominance. He also attempts to prevent trade and interaction with Dayside to hide the fact that there is notable traffic between the continents.
The Dynasty is more technologically advanced than Dayside, as evidenced by their development of firearms. Paired with their perceived social development, citizens of the Dynasty generally consider Daysiders to be uncivilized.
