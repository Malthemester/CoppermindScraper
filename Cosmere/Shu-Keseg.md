**Shu-Keseg** is a religion practiced on [[Sel\|Sel]].
It was the precursor to the [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] and [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] religions. It was founded by a [[JinDo\|JinDo]] man named [[Keseg\|Keseg]] who preached unity of all mankind. His two disciples [[Korath\|Korath]] and [[Dereth\|Dereth]] collected his teachings in a book called the [[Do-Kando\|Do-Kando]]. After Keseg died Korath and Dereth disagreed about how to achieve this unity. Korath thought that mankind should be united through love, whereas Derethi believed mankind should united through obedience by the rule of a single "Holy" government. This disagreement caused the schism in Shu-Keseg.
