This page or section contains details from the unpublished work *The Liar of Partinel*!This information has the potential to ruin plot elements of both published works and upcoming book releases for the reader. It should also be considered uncanonical and could completely change in the future.

*The Liar of Partinel* is an unpublished [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] work that [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] wrote in 2007.
The story takes place on the world of [[Yolen\|Yolen]] and features a character called Midius, a [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaver]] who adopts the name of his master, [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. When it was written, this book was intended to serve as a prequel to the story arc of a rewritten [[Dragonsteel Prime\|Dragonsteel Prime]], but would have been published as a standalone book to avoid confusion with the main Dragonsteel sequence.
It was Sanderson's first attempt at writing [[Hoid\|Hoid's]] origin story, which he wanted to be "epic and awesome," but it just wasn't working and "every chapter was a chore to write." He does not distribute this book because the personality of one character "never clicked," and he does not want it to color fans' predispositions towards that character. He still intends to write this story some day, probably after the [[Stormlight Archive\|Stormlight Archive]] is finished, though he will rewrite it from scratch. The Ars Arcanum of [[Words of Radiance\|Words of Radiance]] claims that Roshar's Lightweaving is the most similar to the "original Yolish variant," suggesting that this portion of the magic will stay canon.
