## History
In 1172, Hab fought in the battle where a full [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]], [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]], made an attempt to kill Amaram. Hab joined Kaladin in his charge on the Shardbearer. When Helaran began to slaghter Kaladin's men, Hab tried to retreat, but he tripped on [[Toorim\|Toorim's]] corpse, which made Hab drop his spear. Hab, [[Coreb\|Coreb]], [[Alabet\|Alabet]], and [[Reesh\|Reesh]] were the only men of Kaladin's squad to survive the fight with Helaran. Hab witnessed Kaladin's defeat of the Shardbearer and his rejection of the [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] in favor of Coreb.
Later that day, Hab was summoned to Amaram's warcenter, along with Kaladin and the other survivors of the squad. Kaladin repeated his desire to give the Shards to Coreb. Amaram instead ordered his men to kill the surviving four men of Kaladin's squad. Hab drew his knife and tried to defend himself, but he was gutted by one of Amaram's soldiers.
When Amaram faces Kaladin during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Kaladin accuses Amaram of feeling guilt for killing [[Coreb\|Coreb]], Hab and other members of Kaladin's squad.
