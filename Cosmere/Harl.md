>“*You cremling, you storm's leavings! Don’t touch Miasal! Don't—*”
\-Harl to Kaladin[1]


**Harl** is a thick-shouldered darkeyed man from [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
In 1166, Harl's daughter [[Miasal\|Miasal]] fell a long ways and was seriously injured. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] happened to be walking by, and did his best to treat her wounds. Harl was beside himself with fear, and initially tried to prevent Kaladin from helping Miasal. Several other men dragged Harl away so Kaladin could work. When he realized that Miasal had died he began shouting, shoving Kaladin aside and clutching his daughter's body. Harl wept holding his daughter's body for a long while.
At some point afterwards, Harl's wife also died from the *scarfever*.
In 1168, with both his wife and daughter dead, Harl voluntarily enlisted in Highmarshal [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army along with [[Tien\|Tien]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]].
