**Bevalis** is the capital of [[Idris\|Idris]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
Its roads are unpaved, and its houses are stone-walled, thatched cottages. The royal palace, which serves as a meeting place and a center of operations for the kingdom, is a single-story building with a courtyard of packed dirt; it is, however, large enough to be considered almost "flamboyant." Bevalis is a small city in comparison with the capitals of other nations on Nalthis, with a population of around a few thousand.
