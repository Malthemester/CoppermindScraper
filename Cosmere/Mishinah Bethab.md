**Mishinah Bethab** is a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] member of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] nobility on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is married to Highprince [[Bethab\|Bethab]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is mousy, and has orange eyes with a pinched face. She is skilled at navigating Alethi politics.

## History
Mishinah's history is not known, but Bethab married her for her political acumen. She often attended political meetings in lieu of her husband. At the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Mishinah—not Bethab himself—informed [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] that House Bethab would not join his assault on the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. Although some of Bethab's soldiers did not respect this arrangement, it generally benefited House Bethab.
After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and the activation of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]], she was seen at a meeting of Alethi nobility in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Mishinah and several highprinces had concerns about providing basic services (such as food, water, and plumbing) to the many new citizens of Urithiru, but [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] was able to quell their fears. Mishinah's questions also implied that she was concerned about Navani seizing power in Dalinar's absence when he temporarily fled to [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]].
Mishinah and her husband eventually came to support Dalinar and the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. They were sent to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] as ambassadors, and Mishinah's political skills proved to be useful.
