>“*I am . . . I was . . . God. The one you call the Almighty, the creator of mankind. And now I am dead. Odium has killed me. I am sorry.*”
\-Honor to Dalinar[3]


**Honor** is one of the sixteen [[Shard\|Shards]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and one of the three, alongside [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] and [[Odium\|Odium]], present in the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]]. The original Vessel of Honor was called [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]]. Following his death at the hands of Odium, Honor was [[Splinter\|Splintered]]. Honor’s [[Investiture\|Investiture]] is typically associated with the color blue-white.

## Intent
Honor seeks to uphold oaths and agreements, and to bind things together. The [[Fused\|Fused]] consider him to be the god of the natural laws of the universe.

### Stormlight
For more information, see [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]].
Stormlight is a gaseous form of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] associated with Honor. It was not created by him, as a proto-version of it existed prior to his arrival on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], but in the present day, it has been subsumed into him. The largest [[Splinter\|Splinter]] of Honor, the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]], is responsible for creating and maintaining the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] that bring stormlight.
Stormlight is crucial to the Rosharan ecosystem. Numerous animals form bonds with lesser [[Spren\|spren]], which most likely require Stormlight as fuel. Moreover, large quantities of Stormlight are necessary for [[Singer\|singers]] to change forms. In [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], spren derive sustenance from Stormlight. While humans do not normally utilize Stormlight themselves, its presence makes them significantly healthier.

### Surgebinding
For more information, see [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].
Surgebinding is a magic system derived from both Honor and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. To utilize it, a person must bond a higher spren, which allows them to inhale Stormlight and use it to control [[Surge\|Surges]], a set of ten fundamental forces, although a single spren bond allows access to only two of them. Some Surges favor Honor, and others Cultivation, although only [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]] is 'purely' of Honor.
Apart from spren bonds, Honor can also grant the use of Surgebinding through the [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]], weapons made out of his Investiture. Like spren, each Honorblade grants access to only one pair of Surges; in fact, Surgebinding came about as spren attempted to imitate the Honorblades.

### Spren
For more information, see [[Spren\|Spren]].
Spren are [[Splinter\|Splinters]] holding the Investitures of both Honor and Cultivation, though in different proportions depending on the type of spren. Some spren are of pure Honor or pure Cultivation, though which type gets to call themselves "closest to Honor" is a matter of some debate among their society.
The most notable spren of Honor is the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]]. Unlike most other spren, Stormfather was created by Honor intentionally; moreover, he has merged with Tanavast's [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]], granting him greater access to the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]].

### Direct intervention
Honor's particular intent lends itself well to binding and forming bonds. Among others, he bound [[Herald\|Heralds]] to himself and tied them to the cycle of [[Desolation\|Desolations]], creating the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] to protect Roshar. He also tied Odium to the greater Rosharan system through some other means, making it impossible for [[Rayse\|Rayse]] to depart unless either the planet is destroyed or whoever holds the largest remnant of Honor's power willingly releases him.

## History
 by  Marie Seeberger  Honor and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]
### Creation
The Shard of Honor was created, like all others, at the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and picked up by [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]]. Though the Shards had an agreement to go their own separate ways, he and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] traveled together to the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]]. However, whatever the actual text of the agreement, Honor did not consider his actions to be breaking it, or exploiting a loophole in it. The reason for that could be that Tanavast's and Cultivation's vessels were romantically involved.

### God of Roshar
On Roshar, Honor and Cultivation became the gods of the [[Singer\|singers]], a native Rosharan species. An unknown period of time later, human refugees arrived from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]], seeking help after accidentally destroying their own world, and the two permitted them to settle on the planet, likely in the region now called [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. Unfortunately, along with them came [[Odium\|Odium]], who by that point had murdered three other Shards -- [[Dominion\|Dominion]], [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Ambition\|Ambition]] -- and was now gunning for either Honor, Cultivation, or both. When the relations between humans and singers of Roshar broke down, singers turned to Odium to help them, leading to the creation of the [[Fused\|Fused]], [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]] of singers who could be reborn into the bodies of their kinsmen every time they died.
To help the people of Roshar, Honor created the [[Herald\|Heralds]], binding ten people to himself and giving them similar resurrective ability, although one that did not require body snatching. Moreover, he bound Odium to the Rosharan system, making it impossible for him to leave. Unfortunately for him, the Heralds abandoned the Oathpact after numerous [[Desolation\|Desolations]] in the event known as the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]]. Sometime afterwards, Odium succeeded at [[Splinter\|Splintering]] him.

### Death
>“*I remember at the end Honor was more obsessed with oaths. There were times when the oath itself was more important than the meaning behind it. But he was not a passionless monster. He loved humankind. He died defending you.*”
\-The Stormfather[26]


Honor's death, however, was a protracted event. Before passing away fully, Honor took some measures to help Rosharans in the future. Chief among them was leaving behind a series of visions to warn of the possibility of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], and to leave behind some information that might be helpful. He prepared the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] to be his inheritor, and gave him the task of choosing the possible recipients of the visions. At the very end of his existence, Tanavast was still capable of communicating with humans, but by then he was raving and no longer supported the Knights Radiant.
He died and his Shard was Splintered shortly after the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Tanavast's [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] merged with the Stormfather, along with the largest portion of Honor's remaining power. That remaining power is sufficient to keep Odium bound to Roshar, and the Oathpact ongoing.

## Influence

>“*The Almighty accepted the excellence of any man or woman, regardless of what they did.*”
\-Vorin doctrine[34]


Honor is well known among the Rosharan people, and worshiped as a god. [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]] calls him the **Almighty** and claims that he's the only deity, considering worship of [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] to be pagan. He's believed to be the creator of both Roshar and mankind. In the Vorin tradition, he has ten names, the last of which, Elithanathile, is only used by [[Ardent\|ardents]], the Vorin priests. It's said he resides in the hearts of all people. As it's commonly believed that perceiving him directly would cause one to burst into flames from his sheer glory, he's typically represented by a divine prism with ten facets.
Vorins believe that the Almighty is also responsible for sorting out the dead and deciding on their afterlife. The best possible outcome is to be sent to battle in [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]], the lost paradise, and reclaim it from the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]. To achieve this, one has to pick a Calling - a purpose in life - and a Glory, an aspect of the Almighty that one strives to emulate.
Honor is also worshiped in [[Azir\|Azir]] and the surrounding countries, though there he's known simply as God. The [[Singer\|singers]] worshiped him and Cultivation once, before the arrival of [[Odium\|Odium]].

## Trivia
In *Magic:The Gathering* colors, Honor would be white.
