## History
Zen was hired by [[Exeltec\|Exeltec]] to trail Stephen Leeds during the I3 fiasco. She went to dinner at the same place he did under the alias Carol Westminster. The following day, she tailed him from his house to the [[Liza\|coroner's]] office, where she confronted him. Ostensibly trying to obtain the flash drive he's holding, her actual purpose there was to bug him so she knew where he was going. After Stephen goes to , Zen confronted him at his car. She told Stephen to get out of the car with his aspects, but, after letting his aspects (all but Audrey, unbeknownst to Zen) leave, she restrained Stephen and told [[Dion Maheras\|Dion Maheras]] to drive or she'll shoot him. The car, driven by Dion and carrying Stephen and Zen, went to a solitary house, where she put Dion and Stephen in the cellar. Several minutes later, she received instructions to kill Stephen and requested that he come outside for "individual questioning". Stephen recognized the ploy and stalled for a few minutes until Zen received a phone call informing her that Stephen was now president of Exeltec. Zen then put away the gun and reverted to a cover story of trying to worry Stephen with the gun so that she can't be charged with attempted murder.
