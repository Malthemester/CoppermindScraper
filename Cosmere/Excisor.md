## History
### Gifted by the Sovereign
Excisors are said to have been created by the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]], who gifted the devices to the Southern Scadrians. A [[Metalborn\|Metalborn]] uses an Excisor as part of an unknown process to create a medallion.
According to [[Allik Neverfar\|Allik Neverfar]], the Sovereign originally trained individuals known as Firemothers and Firefathers in the use of Excisors to create medallions of [[Nicrosil\|nicrosil]] and [[Brass\|brass]]. The medallions were actually unsealed metalminds that granted temporary [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] to anyone who tapped them, even if they were not Metalborn. The first medallions were used as transferrable brassminds, providing the heat necessary for survival after the [[Catacendre\|Ice Death]].

### Expanded Use
The Southern Scadrians later started experimenting with the devices, gaining the ability to create medallions that could provide access to other Feruchemical powers such as storing [[Iron\|weight]] or [[Duralumin\|Connection]]. After many years, they also determined a method to create medallions with multiple powers. This involved a Metalborn creating a medallion, then passing it to another Metalborn so they could add their power to the medallion, presumably using an Excisor at each step. Allik has medallions with two powers, but states that examples with three powers are very rare and that all attempts at incorporating four powers have failed. The number of Excisors that the Southern Scadrians possessed (and whether they were able to make more) is unknown.

## Cosmere Significance
The Feruchemical ability of nicrosil to store [[Investiture\|Investiture]] is extremely powerful but poorly understood in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], even by Feruchemists. The Excisors further enhance nicrosil's potential by allowing anyone to use it. The medallions created with the Excisors are among very few known objects that can grant the use of Investiture to someone that does not otherwise have magical abilities; they have some similarities to [[Rosharan\|Rosharan]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]]. Although the medallions are known to have limitations in practice, in theory they could allow someone to use all thirty-two [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] and Feruchemical powers or possibly even manifestations of Investiture that originate on other [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]], such as [[AonDor\|AonDor]], [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]], and [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].
