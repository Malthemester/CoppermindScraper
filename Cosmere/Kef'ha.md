**Kef'ha** is an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] [[Nuatoma\|nuatoma]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
Kef'ha left the Peaks together with members of his family, including [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]], seeking to gain [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] for his clan. Believing that it would be easier to win against a Shardbearer with no Shardblade, Kef'ha challenged [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] to a duel, with Sadeas' Shardplate on the line. Kef'ha was killed in the duel, which Lunamor claims was not contested "properly".
It is unclear what exactly was offered as stake by Kef'ha, but the Unkalaki usually have to offer a large amount of riches in order to gain an opportunity to duel. [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] and the other members of Kef'ha's household became Sadeas' servants (and effectively slaves) after his death. Both [[Tifi\|Tifi]] and [[Sinaku'a\|Sinaku'a]] were killed for raising weapons in vengeance against Sadeas.
