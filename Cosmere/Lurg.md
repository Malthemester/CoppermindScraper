## Appearance and Anatomy
Lurgs are fist-sized amphibians. Their skin is brown and green and appears slick. This slickness is likely due to the mucus that they secrete. A lurg moves by jumping quickly from place to place, leaving spots of mucus behind it. It is able to cling to rocks using its six legs, at least two of which have tiny hands. A lurg's eyes are located near the center of its back.

## Ecology
Lurgs are known to inhabit northern [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. It is likely that they also live in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]], implying widespread distribution on the Rosharan continent.
A lurg feeds on insects that come out during a rainstorm. Lurgs will find a crevice in the rock and spin themselves a cocoon of white silk, making it spherical with their hands. The container is water-tight from the inside, sealed by the lurg's mucus, but will dissolve during a rainstorm so that the lurg can come out to hunt.
Due to this unique trait, children often go hunting for lurgs to pour water on them and dissolve the cocoon, tricking the lurg into running about. The lurgs will quickly tire when they do not find food, and will stop jumping if this trick is repeated more than a few times. Children also sometimes keep them for pranks, such as putting a lurg into someone's bathwater.

## History
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Tien\|Tien]] enjoyed playing with lurgs while they were growing up in [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]], and Tien was particularly fascinated by them. [[Lift\|Lift]] also liked to catch lurgs.
When Kaladin and [[Syl\|Syl]] were hiking to Hearthstone in the wake of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], Syl spotted a lurg. She was entertained by it and briefly changed form to imitate it.
When Kaladin was fighting [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] outside of Hearthstone he used some cocooned lurgs to distract her and gain a momentary advantage in the fight.

## Trivia
