## Appearance and Personality

For more information, see [[Tai-na\|Tai-na]].
Like other Tai-na, Relu-na has grown to extraordinary size due to a [[Spren\|spren]] bond related to her [[Gemheart\|gemheart]] that allows her body to defy the laws of physics. [[Rysn\|Rysn]] believes that Relu-na is as large as a town. One of Relu-na's eyes is described as a "the size of a house" and it is situated more than fifty feet from the top of her head. She has a massive mouth with huge mandibles. She is referred to as female by [[Gu\|Gu]].
Relu-na's shell has the appearance of a mountainous island jutting out from the ocean with no beach. She is not immediately identifiable as a living being, but when she moves it becomes easier to see that she has legs. She has a stony carapace covered with an array of plant life including moss, trees, [[Shalebark\|shalebark]], and [[Rockbud\|rockbuds]]. The plants grow as thick as a jungle or forest over most of the shell, but relatively few plants grow on the head. The shell has protrusions near the waterline that are used as docks by the residents of the island; stairs have also been cut into the shell. The sea is unusually warm near Relu-na and Rysn compares the water to that of the [[Purelake\|Purelake]].
Relu-na appears to be ancient, as Tai-na are very long-lived. The natives feed Relu-na fruit, but only as a treat; they do not divulge her primary food source. The Tai-na are sentient, and the Reshi people believe that they are also sapient and capable of decision-making. Gu mentions that when two Tai-na approach each other, they decide what will happen nextâ€”a war, or something "good".

## History
 by  botanicaxu  [[Rysn\|Rysn]] swinging in front of Relu-na's head
Rysn and [[Vstim\|Vstim]] visited Relu-na hoping to trade for a [[Larkin\|larkin]] corpse. Rysn was shocked by the existence of Tai-na and was unfamiliar with the island's culture. She and her guards were led on a long hike up to Relu-na's head to meet the king, [[Ral-na\|Ral-na]]. On the way, they encountered [[Axies the Collector\|Axies the Collector]], who had been visiting Relu-na as part of his ongoing spren research. Axies had tried to investigate the Tai-na spren, possibly [[Mandra\|mandras]], but the natives refused to discuss it and instead bound his feet and hung him upside-down.
Upon reaching Relu-na's head, Rysn attempted to trade with the natives. Unbeknownst to Rysn, Vstim had actually trained the king's son, [[Talik\|Talik]], and had covertly arranged for him to be tough on Rysn as a training exercise. However, Rysn became so frustrated by the negotiation that she made a bold attempt to gain the trust of the natives. She climbed down a rope suspended hundreds of feet over the ocean and attempted to address Relu-na directly, but fell when the rope snapped. She survived the fall, and Vstim later told her that the island's spren somehow saved her life. Rysn says she was trying to gain respect after Vstim and Talik repeatedly insisted that Relu-na placed a great deal of value on boldness; after her bold yet reckless act, the island somehow gifted her a living larkin.
When Rysn later wrote to Talik regarding her worries about [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri's]] deteriorating health, Talik and the king were in [[Azimir\|Azimir]]. Talik wrote to the inhabitants of the island, and the king's consort approached Relu-na, who somehow indicated that Chiri-Chiri needed be taken home to [[Akinah\|Akinah]].

## Inhabitants
Relu-na's residents are typical for a Tai-na, and include both native Reshi and expatriates from other parts of Roshar. The residents generally lead a relaxed lifestyle and often spend their time swimming and diving. The island is ruled by a king, who has authority over the soldiers and would lead them in battle if necessary.
