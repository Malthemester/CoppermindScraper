**Camon's crew** is a group of petty thieves operating in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. Camon is a harsh leader. He is perfectly willing to abandon any crew member who does not prove themselves useful. [[Camon's safehouse\|Camon's safehouse]] is their hideout.
The crew was formed and lead by [[Camon\|Camon]]. Later [[Milev\|Milev]] takes control of the crew after [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] removes Camon.

## History
Their final job under Camon is a joint operation with [[Theron\|Theron's]] crew to steal from the [[Canton of Finance\|Canton of Finance]], but [[Vin\|Vin's]] use of [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] on an [[Obligator\|obligator]] during the job leads to a [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitor]] being sent after them. Although Kelsier is able to distract the Inquisitor and make them lose the trail, they eventually find them regardless, and slaughter the whole crew.
Camon was likely aware of Vin's allomantic abilities. She did not have much use in the crew other than these abilities due to her small size. She was useful to Camon by using what she called 'luck', to persuade people into actions useful to Camon. She did this by unknowingly ingesting trace amounts of metals, and burning them allomantically.
