## History
No contemporary accounts from the time of his reign survive. A text detailing his life was written two hundred years after his death by [[Natata Ved\|Natata Ved]], also known as Oileyes. Although Oileyes claimed that she performed rigorous research, historical scholarship was in its infancy at the time. She is known to have a passion for the dramatic, and her version of NanKhet's story reads more like a parable than a historical text.

### Natata Ved's Account
According to Oileyes, NanKhet inherited the throne from his brother [[NanHar\|NanHar]] and then survived six assassination attempts during his three month rule. The first assassination attempt was a poisoning by his sister, who wanted to put her husband on the throne; after surviving, he had them both executed. The second attempt was by their son, who tried to kill his uncle in his bed, but NanKhet was able to defend himself and kill his nephew with his own sword. The third was from a cousin, and left NanKhet blind in one eye. The fourth was by another brother, the fifth an uncle, and the sixth his own son.
NanKhet was so frustrated by this that he gathered the rest of his household together at a feast where he had them all killed, then cooked his dinner on a funeral pyre made from their bodies. He ate the food while sitting alone at the huge feast table, but when he started choking, he died because no one was left to help him.

## Legacy
The [[Siln\|Siln]] dynasty was founded after his death.
His life and death interest [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], who notes that familial infighting was common throughout the history of the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] kingdoms.
