## Geography
Kerzta is located in the southwest region of Dayside. It is bordered to the east by [[Lossand\|Lossand]] and the [[Kerla\|Kerla]], and the northern border is not well defined. The capital of Kerzta is [[Ker Kedasha\|Ker Kedasha]].
Despite no rivers or bodies of fresh water in Kerzta, the nation is not located in a desert due to the prevalence of [[Dorim vine\|dorim vines]].

## History
The kingship of Kerzta has been historically controlled by the high priest. As a result, Kerzta was often at war with Lossand in the past for religious and political reasons. Over time, the nobility began to be dominated by more merchants than priests, which led to the crowning of a high merchant as king 200 years ago. This brought a time of relative peace for the sake of economic gain.
