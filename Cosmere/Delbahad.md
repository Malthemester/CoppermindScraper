**Delbahad** is a holiday in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]].
By the reign of Emperor [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]], the celebration of Delbahad had stopped. While [[Wan ShaiLu\|Shai]] was [[Forgery\|Forging]] a new soul for Ashravan, the [[Heritage Faction\|Heritage Faction]] reinstituted the celebration of Delbahad hoping to sway public opinion in their favor. Shai thought this was foolish; if she failed to Forge a soul for Ashravan, the arbiters of the factions would select the new emperor, not the people.
