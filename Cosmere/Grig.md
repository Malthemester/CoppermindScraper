The **grig** is a species of dinosaur-like creature in the [[Cytoverse\|Cytoverse]], and some inhabit fragments in the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]]. They are reptilian and walk on two legs, with a long tail that trails behind their body. Their eyes are on its shoulders, and its neck is a long and trunk-like, ending in a toothy mouth. It has whiskers along its neck's length to allow it to feel its way through trees. Grigs are large and fierce looking, and are at least more than a meter wide.
Despite their fearsome appearances, they are usually used as pack animals. They feed on energy, and aren't fazed by energy blasts. They can be tamed by giving them an offering of a small power matrix or other energy source. After a feast, they usually wander off to sleep.
