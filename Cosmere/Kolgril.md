The **kolgril** is a fish native to the [[Purelake\|Purelake]].
The locals of the Purelake believe that the kolgril is very lucky. It is said to cure aching joints for a month after being eaten, and some also report that it allows you to read the shapes of the clouds to determine when friends are going to visit. It is likely that these rumors are true, to an extent, as many of the fish in the Purelake have formed symbiotic bonds with [[Spren\|spren]], making them [[Investiture\|Invested]] in some way--not unlike [[Ryshadium\|Ryshadium]] or [[Aviar\|Aviar]].
[[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] caught a kolgril one morning and offered it as a gift to [[Maib\|Maib]], who had a particular liking for the fish due to aches in her fingers, in order to put her in his debt and avoid her ongoing attempts to bait him into marriage.
