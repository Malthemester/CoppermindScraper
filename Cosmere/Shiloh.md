**Shiloh** is a sword used by [[Jax (Reckoners)\|Jax]]. It is a sword from the U.S. Civil War, presumably a . It is 25 inches long, double edged, has a 4 inch crossguard, and has a hilt made of solid brass.
Shiloh was originally owned by [[Dan\|Dan]], but Jax took it with him when he joined the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] after Dan died. When Jax arrived at the [[Coop\|Coop]], Shiloh was taken from him by [[Zeff\|Zeff]], who said that the sword would be returned once Jax could actually use it. After Jax became skilled with practice swords and eventually struck back at Zeff, Zeff gave Shiloh back to him.
During the infiltration of Lux, Jax uses Shiloh to try to kill [[Lifeforce\|Lifeforce]] after the original plan fails. Lifeforce uses the stolen power of the Epic Shiversting to shatter the sword, and the pieces are later sent to [[Parik\|Parik]]’s lab. When the Reckoners pass through the lab while retrieving their things, Paige collects the broken shards of the sword. Once at a safe house, Paige welds the pieces back together, repairing the blade and giving it to Jax as a suprise gift. That is when Jax decides on Shiloh’s name. During their final confrontation with Lifeforce, Jax realizes that his weakness is silver and loops [[Dan\|Dan]]’s silver ring onto Shiloh, then uses the boomerang watch to stab Shiloh into Lifeforce, killing him.
