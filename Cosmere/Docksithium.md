The **Docksithium** is a document on post-[[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It was allegedly written by one of the [[Preservers\|Preservers]], [[Dockson\|Dockson]], but is considered apocryphal, likely because Dockson died before the Catacendre. There is at least one copy stored in a room of the museum underneath the [[Field of Rebirth\|Field of Rebirth]].
[[Wax\|Wax]] tried to read it once and found it very dull.
