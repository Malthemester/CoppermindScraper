>“*The Dawnsingers weren’t spren, as theology has often postulated. Nor were they Heralds. They were parshmen.*”
\-Jasnah Kholin[1]

## Legends
Like other ancient Rosharan concepts, [[Vorin\|Vorin]] legends obfuscated the true nature of the Dawnsingers for centuries, if not millenia. The ardentia believe them to be healing [[Spren\|spren]] sent by the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] to care for humans. They are also said to be the origin of [[Glyphs\|glyphs]] and letters.
Some [[Lighteyed\|lighteyes]] believe that certain cities known as "[[Dawncities\|Dawncities]]" can trace their origins back to the Dawnsingers. These claims seem to stem from the spectacular organic architecture that mirrors specific [[Cymatics\|cymatic]] patterns in cities such as [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]] and surpasses known human capabilities, but there is no direct evidence of the origin of these cities.

## History
The discovery of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] refuted many of the legends surrounding the Dawnsingers. The stele contained the oldest known text on Roshar, written by a Dawnsinger in their native language known as [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. It recounted the arrival of humans to Roshar after they destroyed their home planet of [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]], possibly using a [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] in some way. The Dawnsingers took pity on the humans and gave them the land that became [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. After the humans arrived, they betrayed the Dawnsingers and even turned their gods "of spren, stone, and wind" against them; this presumably referred to the power of [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] being granted to humans, which motivated the spren to begin forming [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] with them. [[Odium\|Odium]] was involved in these events, and the Dawnsingers considered him a god of the humans. The Dawnsingers believed that Odium sucked in all emotion, and therefore named the humans the "[[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]".
After the revelations of the Eila Stele, some members of the [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] [[Order of Skybreakers\|Order of Skybreakers]] led by [[Nale\|Nale]] determined that the Dawnsingers remained the rightful rulers of Roshar. Because Skybreakers were obligated to enforce the prevailing law, Nale and his followers planned to swear to the Dawnsingers and their laws instead of the local codes put in place by humans.

## Legacy
The Dawnsingers are the ancestors of modern singers, including the [[Listener\|listeners]]. Some of the songs of the listeners—including the [[Song of Spren\|Song of Spren]], the [[Song of Secrets\|Song of Secrets]], and the [[Song of Histories\|Song of Histories]]—mention the ancient history of the singers. They refer to the perceived betrayal perpetrated by humans and spren, and go on to mention the adoption of [[Regal\|forms of power]] to help fight back (and some unintended consequences). However, this history is "fraught" and the songs are not entirely consistent.
