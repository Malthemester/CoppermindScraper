## Contents
It is among the earliest extant pieces of Selish literature, thought to be preceded only by *Wyrn the King*. The book consists of the teachings of the [[JinDo\|JinDo]] religious philosopher [[Keseg\|Keseg]] (also known as Keshu or KeHwo), as recorded by his two primary disciples, [[Dereth\|Dereth]] and [[Korath\|Korath]]. Keseg drew from the traditional JinDo value of unity and applied the concepts of a single, omnipotent god and an organized ministry. Keseg's work was considered revolutionary even though his primary intent was to clarify existing JinDo beliefs.

## Legacy
[[Dereth\|Dereth]] and [[Korath\|Korath]] interpreted Keseg's teachings differently and wrote their own holy books, the *Do-Dereth* and the *Do-Korath*. These books remain the basis for the two religions most commonly practiced in modern [[Opelon\|Opelon]]. The [[Shu-Dereth\|Derethi]] still use the *Do-Kando* to some extent alongside the *Do-Dereth*.
While explaining his supposed conversion to Shu-Dereth to [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]], [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] claimed that a Derethi [[Arteth\|arteth]] gave him a copy of both the *Do-Kando* and the *Do-Dereth* and that he read them in one night.

## Trivia
In the original printings of *Elantris*, this book was referred to as the *Do-Keseg* in chapter 3 and *Do-Kando* in chapter 43. The Tenth Anniversary edition of *Elantris* changed both references to *Do-Kando*.
