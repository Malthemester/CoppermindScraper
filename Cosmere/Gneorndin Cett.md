**Gneorndin Cett** was the only son of [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Personality
Gneorndin seems to have a strong protective instinct for his family. He dislikes [[Breeze\|Breeze]] for being in a relationship with his sister, [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]], who was much younger than Breeze. When [[Vin\|Vin]] threaten's his father's life, Gneorndin attempts to protect his father, despite his lack of powers and fear of Vin's abilities. The bravery that such an action requires is incredible.

## History
After the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], Gneorndin invited [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] to meet with Cett in a week to discuss Allrianne. He accused Elend of kidnapping her, even though he knew it was not true. Gneorndin also seemed to know at that point that Breeze was in a relationship with Allrianne, due to the fact that he glared at Breeze and did not seem to like him very much.
When Vin launched her attack with [[Zane\|Zane]] on [[Keep Hasting\|Keep Hasting]], Gneorndin was there. Although he had no [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] powers, Gneorndin tried to protect his father from Vin's wrath. On Cett's request, Vin simply knocked him aside rather than seriously injuring or killing him.
After Cett joined his forces with Elend's, Gneorndin was at the meeting of the crew when Elend explained how the encroaching [[Mist\|mists]] of the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] would soon make growing conventional crops impossible.
As Gneorndin is the only known male member of [[House Cett\|House Cett]] (aside from [[Ashweather\|Ashweather]]), it seems likely that through his lineage the house continued to exist past the [[Final Ascension\|Catacendre]] and into [[Mistborn Era 2\|Mistborn Era 2]] and modern Scadrial.
