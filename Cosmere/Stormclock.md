>“* One showed the time with three hands—even seconds, as if that mattered. The other was a stormclock, which could be set to wind down to the next projected highstorm.*”
\- Dalinar describing Navani's vambrace[1]


A **stormclock** is a device from [[Roshar\|Roshar]] which can be used to tell when a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] is due. It's composed of a single arm on a round face, and some hidden mechanisms.
Rather than a clock, it's more akin to a timer. The user must wind it up for the amount of time they predict is left until a highstorm. The stormclock then counts down the time and makes a small dinging sound upon finishing. As such, it can be used to count down until other things as well, such as the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].
While regular Rosharan timepieces are [[Fabrial\|fabrials]], it's uncertain whether stormclocks are as well or if they work purely mechanically.
The stormclocks have existed on Roshar for some time, but [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] is the first to create a version small enough to wear on one's wrist. She designs a leather vambrace that combines a stormclock with a regular fabrial clock and a [[Painrial\|painrial]], and gifts it to several people, among them [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Adrotagia\|Adrotagia]].
