**Sliverism** is a religion on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] that arose after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]].
According to [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]], they are known to revere [[Ironeyes\|Ironeyes]].
It can be inferred that Sliverism is an evolution of the dominant religion of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], brought to the new world by [[Obligator\|obligators]] that survived the Final Ascension, as the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] was referred to the "Sliver of Infinity" in religious terms. This is a possible motive for worshiping Ironeyes, as the old religion revered [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]], of which Ironeyes is the last member.
