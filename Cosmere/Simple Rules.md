## History and Consequences
For more information, see Shade#Appearance and Behavior.
The origin of the rules is unknown, and the residents of Threnody do not fully understand how they work, even the [[Forescout\|Forescouts]] who were the first residents of the Forests of Hell. Breaking a rule and drawing the attention of shades is not a certain death sentence, but it is very difficult to escape them. Violating each rule provokes a slightly different reaction in the shades. Drawing blood enrages them instantly, while running gets their attention much more slowly. Kindling fire brings immediate attention, but the fire tends to blind and confuse the shades. Residents of the [[Fortress Town\|Fortress Towns]] are thought to be more careless with the Rules than homesteaders.
It is possible to violate the Rules inside a ring of [[Silver\|silver]] without drawing shades, but it is best not to do so even if you believe that you are safe. Legend held that the [[White Fox\|White Fox]] could break the Simple Rules because shades would not dare come for their soul.

## Trivia
The Simple Rules are inspired by Jewish laws about what can't be done on Shabbat.
The rules may be explored further in a [[The Dust Brigade\|potential sequel]] to *Shadows for Silence*.
