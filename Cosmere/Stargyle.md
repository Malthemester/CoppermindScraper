## Attributes and Abilities
Stargyle is a [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]], bonded to an unknown [[Cryptic\|cryptic]]. This grants him access to the [[Surges\|surges]] of Illumination and Transformation. He is particularly skilled at seeing into [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. When he creates illusions, his method of focus is to act as if he were painting.

## History
Stargyle was born to a pigmenter, so he grew up viewing the world through its colors. He likely was born with a different name and took the name of Stargyle later. At some point he served as a soldier, married, and found his way to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] recruited Stargyle into her group of Lightweavers, which she began calling the Unseen Court. As he was one of the newest recruits, and therefore least known to her, she asked him to accompany the diplomatic mission to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. At the last minute, however, his wife fell ill and he had to back out of the trip. [[Beryl\|Beryl]] instead asked to accompany the envoy to the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]].
Stargyle ended up accompanying the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] force that recaptured [[Emul\|Emul]]. When [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] determined that the best way for him to learn to use his [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] abilities was to speak to [[Ishar\|Ishar]], [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] took Stargyle and a couple of [[Windrunner\|Windrunners]] to scout out the situation in [[Tukar\|Tukar]]. On their return, Stargyle was able to create an illusion for Dalinar that played out a depiction of what the group saw as they flew over Ishar's army.

## Trivia
Stargyle's is a cameo for Steve Argyle, the artist who did illustrations of each order of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] for *The Way of Kings* leatherbound Kickstarter and some of the interior art for *The Way of Kings* leatherbound edition.
