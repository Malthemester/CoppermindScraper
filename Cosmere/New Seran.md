## Structure
The city spans across a series of enormous, flat-topped stone terraces. There are at least a dozen of them, each being separated by multiple streams. These streams cross the terraces and drop off the edge down to the next terrace. The water eventually makes its way back to the river, which flows toward [[Elendel\|Elendel]].
Aerial gondolas, strung by lines at least a hundred feet in the air, are commonly used for transport around the city. The gondolas are not only used to get from one terrace to another, but also from part of a terrace to another part. However, traveling is not limited to just gondolas. There are ramps for people who would prefer to use a carriage and bridges that allow people to travel on foot.
On average the houses are smaller than those in Elendel. There are only a few apartment buildings; Wax notes only three skyscrapers. Although the terraces constrain the boundaries of the city, it is large enough to hold a sizable population. This leaves room for many parks and streams.
New Seran is loud because of the waterfalls. Wax finds the sound comparable to that of an earthquake or explosion.

## Notable Locations and Features
 by  Lyraina 
### Copper Gate
The hotel that [[Wax\|Wax]] and his group stay at. It is run by a woman named Aunt [[Gin\|Gin]].

### Shores Mansion
A building with stained glass windows. It has limelights burning outside (a classical style of lighting) though the interior looks little like the ancient keeps. It has a multi-peaked roof design, similar to the profile of a mountain.
The mansion is owned by [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores]], although [[Hoid\|Hoid]] also claims ownership.

### University of New Seran
New Seran has a university, where the playwright [[B. Sablerfils\|B. Sablerfils]] teaches a course on writing "scientific fantasies".

## Culture
### Animosity Towards Elendel
As one can see through the various political cartoons in newspapers, New Seran feels a large amount of animosity towards Elendel, saying that it stomps upon their liberty, prosperity, and fortune. This is in response to the economic hegemony that Elendel has over them through unfair taxation, which has led many other cities to rioting.
They often refer to Elendel, as a political entity, as "The Raging Lion", and as an extension know Elendel, as a city, as "The Lion's Den"
By contrast, New Seran is represented by an Ornate Hawk-Eagle in a political cartoon in the New Ascendancy.

### Fashion
People wear lighter clothing in New Seran than they do in Elendel. Women typically wear pastel dresses, while men wear striped white suits and boater hats.

### Known Products
Zinc Brand Whiskey is a product in New Seran marketed for being locally distilled, therefore having never went through Elendel, profiting off the New Seran animosity towards Elendel.
