\-Lady Heelis[2]


Lady Judge **Heelis** is the leader of the [[Hall of Judgement\|Hall of Judgement]] in [[Lossand\|Lossand]] on [[Taldain\|Taldain]].

## Appearance and Personality
Lady Heelis is an elderly woman with pale skin and grey hair which she keeps in a heart-shaped pompadour. She is seen wearing the standard clothing of the Taishin, along with golden hoop earrings.
Heelis takes her job very seriously and follows the letter of the law carefully. She highly values impartiality, and her trust is not easily earned. Though she comes across as cold, she works hard to protect her people from any perceived threats.

## History
It is unknown how long Heelis has served as Lady Judge, though it is implied she has held the position for a number of years.
When the Taishin voted on the future of the [[Diem\|Diem]], Heelis voted in favor of dissolving it, however she then declares the proceedings void after [[Kenton\|Kenton]] argues a legal technicality that was not observed. She later confided in Kenton that her vote was primarily a matter of solidarity. She claims that she hopes Kenton can successfully change the minds of the Taishin, though she offers little hope that he will be successful.
She showed a great deal of trust in [[Ais\|Ais]], whom she has known for eighteen years, tasking her with spying on Kenton and reporting back despite Ais's personal biases against the [[Sand mastery\|sand masters]].
When Ais reported the death of the Lord General the Lady Heelis thanked her but reminded her that her main job was to protect Kenton.
When Ais told Lady Heelis that she intended to resign as a trackt for personal reasons, Lady Heelis warned her that running from her problems wouldn't help. She also asked Ais to remain a trackt for another day.
After the duel, when the Taishin voted on whether to disband the Diem, Lady Heelis gave her vote to Ais because she wanted Kenton to prove that he could win over the people most firmly set against him. After some internal conflict, Ais decided to vote to maintain the Diem making the vote unanimous and saving the Diem.
