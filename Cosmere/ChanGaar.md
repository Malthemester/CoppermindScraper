>“*Know that your greatest sin was that of rebellion... Because of you, the Trust has been endangered, as has every kandra of every generation!*”
\-KanPaar during TenSoon's sentencing[1]


**ChanGaar** is an imprisonment ritual used by the [[Kandra\|kandra]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] to punish those who have committed the most serious of crimes.
The ritual consists of breaking the offending kandra's bones and then sealing them in a pit with only a small hole for food. The kandra is left there for ten generations, after which they are starved to death.
[[KanPaar\|KanPaar]] sentences [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] to ChanGaar for rebelling against the council and betraying the secret of how to control the kandra to [[Vin\|Vin]]. However, TenSoon uses his superior strength and speed that his canine body provides him to escape before it could be carried out.
