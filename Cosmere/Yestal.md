Lord **Yestal** is a [[Noble\|noble]] in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
He regularly attended balls held by the nobility in Luthadel. He initially welcomed [[Valette Renoux\|Valette Renoux]], and danced with her on at least one occasion.
He was among the nobles that suddenly became cold towards Valette during a ball at [[Keep Venture\|Keep Venture]], ignoring her when she approached his group before excusing himself and [[Triss\|Triss]] for their meal. Valette suspected that the change in attitude may have been related to her confrontation with [[Shan Elariel\|Shan Elariel]]. However, [[Sazed\|Sazed]] pointed out that the ball was likely to be the last one for a long while, and nobles such as Yestal did not want to waste time politicking with neutral parties such as Valette.
