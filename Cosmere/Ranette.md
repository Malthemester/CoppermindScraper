## Appearance & Personality
 by  Jamie Knierim 
>“*People are stupid. I find them annoying, and those are the ones I like.*”
\-Ranette[4]


Ranette is tall, long-legged, and lean, with dark hair which she wears in a shoulder-length ponytail. While Wax, Wayne and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] are staying in her house, she wears boots, brown trousers, a white laced shirt and a long Roughs-style leather coat.
Ranette is quick to threaten to shoot people who annoy her -- as well as Wax and particularly [[Wayne\|Wayne]] -- but she doesn't shoot anyone she allows inside her home. She keeps a shotgun in a basket next to her front door. Though she excels at gunsmithing, she prefers to keep to herself and doesn't want to be bothered by people. As such, she doesn't sell or patent her inventions. She also hates people sensing her [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and hires [[Smoker\|Smokers]] to cover her house. She is also not wealthy enough to use aluminium in her guns. She values guns greatly, willing to forgive Wax and Wayne in exchange for an interesting weapon. Upon losing [[Vindication\|Vindication]], Wax believes that Ranette will be furious with him for it.
Ranette is a lesbian. She is romantically involved with [[Misra\|Misra]].

## Attributes & Abilities
Ranette is a [[Lurcher\|Lurcher]].
Ranette seems to only use her abilities as a Lurcher for simple convenience (i.e., pulling items out of reach toward her, et cetera) and to use devices of her own creation that only a Lurcher can use.
As a gunsmith, Ranette is highly skilled and is responsible for the creation of numerous guns as well as various other contraptions and innovations. She can competently identify a gun's creator.

## History
 by  Shuravf  Ranette pointing a gun at Wax and Wayne when they try to enter her home.
### The Roughs
Ranette used to live in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] as a gunsmith and made [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] his Sterrions and Ambersair.

### Elendel
Ranette moved to [[Elendel\|Elendel]] sometime before Waxillium's return due to the city providing access to electricity which the Roughs lacked. She has her workshop in the [[Elendel\|Third Octant]].
Wax, [[Wayne\|Wayne]], and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] visit Ranette after Wax's study gets destroyed in an explosion. At first, she tries to chase them away by pointing a shotgun at them but decides to let them in after Wayne offers her the aluminum gun Wax had taken from the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]]. Once inside, Ranette starts working on pulling apart the gun and discovers it was made by a gunsmith called [[Nouxil\|Nouxil]], with whom she had been corresponding until his disappearance a year ago. Wax explains Ranette his need of a new gun but she refuses to give him anything. Wax then proceeds to explain how [[Miles Hundredlives\|Miles Hundredlives]] has been trying to kill him and his companions. Ranette has hard time believing Miles would do that, but decides to lend Wax [[Vindication\|Vindication]] and [[Hazekiller\|hazekiller]] rounds for field testing after she hears Miles has been taking hostages whose lives are now in danger. She also lets Wax use a room in her house for planning and lends Marasi a rifle and a pair of trousers. 

### Dealing with Bleeder
Ranette sends Wax new equipment for testing purposes. The equipment package contains a tether, the first version of a grappling hook invention, she wants him to experiment with while jumping with [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]. 
Wax sends Ranette a note via an errand boy asking her to make him a special bullet to take down a [[Kandra\|kandra]] named [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]]. Within hours Ranette arrives to Governor [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate's]] mansion to deliver the special bullet she made out of Wax's [[Pathian\|Pathian]] earring. She hands the bullet over to Wayne who later gives it to Wax. Ranette talks about the current situation of things with Wayne and seems very worried about the people gathering outside which makes Wayne go check things out and Ranette leaves. 

### Wayne's gift
Ranette is returning home after delivering Wax's new cords when she sees Wayne near her new residence where she had moved a few months ago. She notices the notebook Wayne had left at her door and demands him to explain. After Wayne's initial explanation she flips through the notebook and reads the words Wayne had written on the last page. She figures out he is finally giving up on the wish of dating her and moving on. Ranette smiles and thanks him. Wayne tries his luck one more time by asking Ranette about her girlfriend but she firmly rejects him again so he finally leaves.
