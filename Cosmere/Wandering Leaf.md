**Wandering Leaf** is an abandoned flying military [[Platform\|platform]], similar to the defensive shells around [[Detritus\|Detritus]]. It was abandoned after the [[Human wars\|Second Human War]], centuries ago. It used to move through the miasma controllably, but now it simply drifts. It is equipped with an array of autoturrets, which shoot at anything within range, as well as having a [[Taynix\|taynix]] box which can be used to fire enormous [[Mindblade\|mindblades]]. It has oxygen generators on board, so that inhabitants don’t breathe in the toxic miasma. It floats in the miasma of [[ReDawn (planet)\|ReDawn]], near the Hollow. The [[UrDail\|UrDail]] who populate the Hollow monitor Wandering Leaf closely, in case it grows to near to the settlement.

## History
During [[Alanik\|Alanik]] and [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight's]] uprising against the [[Unity\|Unity]] faction, they boarded Wandering Leaf, hyperjumping underneath the turret’s range. They temporarily made it their base of operations, figuring out its mechanisms.
