## Appearance and Personality
Parlin is quiet, an accomplished hunter who prefers forests and animals to cities and people.
In Idris Parlin wore dull brown clothing that would help camouflage him in the mountains and forests. In T'Telir he wore clothing that helped him blend in there. A bright green hat that flopped down the side of his face and colourful vests. He was tall but not lanky. He has a square-jawed face.{book ref|warbreaker|14}}
Like most Idrians he is a follower of Austre and dresses and acts with self-deprecation. He is terse, not rude, just didn’t need to say much. He is solid and reliable. Vivenna fears [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] is probably overwhelming him. Crowds make him nervous.
[[Denth\|Denth]] describes Parlin as "quick at adapting to situations" and "trustworthy" making him worth keeping around. Though he does admit that Parlin has "not got the wit of a scholar."

## Attributes and Abilities
Parlin is an good hunter and scout. He is able to blend into his surroundings and very observant.  He quickly picks up on the customs and mannerisms of the street toughs of T'Telir and adopts both to better blend into the city.

## History
>“*I can’t smell anything but bodies and spices, can’t hear anything but the chatter of people. There’s no wind, no trees, no rivers, just…people.*”
\-Parlin to Vivenna.[2]


Before departing, Parlin was guarding the Northern Passes. He acts as [[Vivenna\|Vivenna's]] bodyguard when she goes secretly to [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] after her sister [[Siri\|Siri]], and is several years Vivenna's senior. He was easy to convince and already knew the route, as he had scouted the wall a year before.
Nevertheless, his skill at blending in with nature translates well to the city. Parlin adopts a brightly colored hat and vest in T'Telir, which Vivenna claims make him look ridiculous, but [[Denth\|Denth]] points out simply make him look Hallandren. Parlin also takes a shine to [[Jewels\|Jewels]] at one point which sparks jealousy in Vivenna, though she refuses admit it when Denth brings it up.
He is tortured to death by the mercenary [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]] when Denth believes Vivenna has run away, as only a short time previously he had talked to her on the stairs and she may have confided in him. Denth did not intend for Tonk Fah to kill him, but Tonk Fah got carried away during the torture. His body is then left tied to a chair in the safe house in the slums. It works like bait in a trap because when it is discovered by Vivenna it is here she is taken by Denth and Tonk Fah. Vivenna blames herself for Parlin's death, as she convinced him to come on this mission. 

## Relationships
He is the son of General [[Yarda\|Yarda]].
He is the man King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] would have married [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] to had she not been promised to the [[Susebron\|God King]]. They were close friends throughout childhood.
[[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] is not in love with Parlin, but she does have affection for him. She views him more as a brother.
He is attracted to [[Jewels\|Jewels]], but she is only amused by him. She is not romantically interested, as she is already involved with [[Arsteel\|Arsteel]].

## Quotes
>**Vivenna**: "*Unfortunately, Parlin, people aren't like animals**"***Parlin**: "*I know, animals make sense**"*
\-Vivenna: "Unfortunately, Parlin, people aren't like animals
"
Parlin: "I know, animals make sense
"


## Trivia
In early drafts of Warbreaker, Parlin was named Peprin and was much more bumbling and innocent. 
If [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] could change anything about Warbreaker, it would be to make Parlin a more compelling character. His death should have been more impactful.
