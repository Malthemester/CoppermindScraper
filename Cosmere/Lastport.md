**Lastport** is a city on [[Threnody\|Threnody]], one of the [[Fortress Town\|Fortress Towns]] near the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]].
Lastport is the most powerful city on its continent. [[Daggon\|Daggon]] notes that Lastport resident [[Lamentation Winebare\|Lamentation Winebare]] has a squeaky, noticeable accent.
As a Fortress Town (or "fort"), it is one of the few areas on the continent where people can live without constant fear of attack by [[Shade\|shades]]. The residents of the forts dress fashionably and consider themselves "civilized" compared to the homesteaders that live in the Forests.
[[Theopolis\|Theopolis]] has connections in Lastport and travels there when he needs to collect bounties in the name of the White Fox ([[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]]). Prices of [[Silver\|silver]] are on the rise in both Lastport and [[Bastion Hill\|Bastion Hill]].
The governor of Lastport was murdered under unknown circumstances by highwayman [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]]. The city of Lastport offered an enormous bounty for Chesterton, calling him an anarchist, psychopath, and menace; when Chesterton visits [[Silence's waystop\|Silence's waystop]] she immediately plans to kill him and his gang, believing that the proceeds will fund her operations for at least a year.
The elite of Lastport have begun to worry about Silence's waystop being owned by someone they did not know, as it was such a crucial waystop.
