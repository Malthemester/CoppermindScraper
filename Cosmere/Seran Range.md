The **Seran Range** is a mountain range in the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is southeast of [[Elendel\|Elendel]] and is one of the mountain ranges that separates the basin from the [[Roughs\|Roughs]].
The [[Seran River\|Seran River]] cuts through the mountains, and a major railway line loosely follows the river's path. The city of [[New Seran\|New Seran]] is also close to the foothills of the mountains. The mountains have snow-capped peaks and are generally uninhabited due to their cold, stormy climate.
It is presumably named for the [[Conventical of Seran\|Conventical of Seran]], the sanctuary of the Steel Inquisitors during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], which was located far southeast of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]].
