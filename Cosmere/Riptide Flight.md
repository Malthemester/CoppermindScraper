**Riptide Flight** is a scout flight of [[DDF\|DDF]] pilots. Jorgen joins Riptide Flight after graduation, becoming the eighth member of the squad. As of the Second Battle of Alta, there are only five members remaining in the squad. The flightleader of Riptide Flight is [[Terrier\|Terrier]].

## History
The Flight was involved in the battle over the first half of the falling shipyard, and returned to base with [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] after [[Nedd\|Nedd]] and [[Spensa\|Spensa]] emerged from inside the wreck.
Riptide assisted Skyward when they were attacked by [[Varvax\|Krell]] during a routine tagging exercise. Four members of the Flight went after a [[Lifebuster\|lifebuster]] that was headed towards [[Alta Base\|Alta Base]] during the battle. The pilots managed to scare off the ship, with the lifebuster eventually retreating.
Riptide later participated in the [[Battle of Alta Second\|Battle of Alta Second]], initially being sent out to the second half of the falling shipyard to defend it from the Krell. When the DDF realized that the attack on the shipyard was a diversion, Admiral [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]] ordered Riptide Flight back to base. Upon their return, they aided Spensa in defending Alta Base by attacking the black Krell ships that were defending the lifebuster. [[Arturo\|Arturo]] and [[Nedd\|Nedd]] fought alongside Riptide flight during this fight. When the lifebuster was dropped, Terrier ordered them away.
Riptide Flight was involved in a battle against the Superiority when they tried to use a battleship to bombard Detritus. One member of their flight got stuck outside of Detritus when the shield came online, and met up with [[Jorgen Weight\|Jorgen Weight]] to be hyperjumped to the other side of the shield, via a [[Taynix\|taynix]].
