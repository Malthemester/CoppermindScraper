## Geography and Ecology
Marat borders the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] to the south, [[Tukar\|Tukar]] to the west, [[Emul\|Emul]] to the northwest, and [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]] to the east. The northernmost part of Marat includes the southernmost part of mountain range in the center of the continent. A river separates the border between Marat and Tukar. A grain similar to wheat that pulls down into burrows grows in Marat. Disc-like creatures with claws eat the grain then leave droppings with seeds to the east. The seeds grow into polyps, then blow back west to grow into grain.
Despite its low population, Marat has a few notable settlements. Along the Southern Depths is the city of [[Rossen Dar\|Rossen Dar]]--possibly Marat's capital--and the towns of [[Jabom\|Jabom]] and [[Ja Dran\|Ja Dran]]. Near Tukar's border, there is the town of [[Khrishji\|Khrishji]], and close to Hexi there is the town of [[Mikhan\|Mikhan]].

## History
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] visited the country during his exile. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], one of the first moves of the [[Fused\|Fused]] was to gather a large force of [[Singer\|singers]] in southern Marat. During their conquest, the singers pressed any survivors into labor at docks but allowed them to burn their dead. The Fused amassed a large naval fleet of over a hundred ships in the Marat ports and coves in preparation to launch an attack at [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. In the week before the assault, [[Venli\|Venli]] lived in a cave and told the story of the [[Listener\|listeners]] to the singers to prepare them to fight. [[Nale\|Nale]] brought [[Szeth\|Szeth]] and the other [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]] there to tell them the truth of the [[First Desolation\|First Desolation]]. The fleet left for Thaylen City during the surprise [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and returned after Odium's defeat.

## Politics
Marat is a tribal nation. Each city in the country is run by a leader referred to as elder brother, analogous to the [[Highprince\|highprinces]] of eastern nations. Marat's only contribution in global politics is its role as a waystop between [[Vorin\|Vorin]] and [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] kingdoms. Marat has a low population. Some people in the east, including [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], consider the Marati people to be barbarians.

## Culture
### Peoples
West of Marat, women's hands are not covered for modesty. The people who live in Marat, as in [[Tukar\|Tukar]] and the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]], tend to have brown skin tones and black hair.

### Economy
Marat has grand bazaars that attract merchants looking for lucrative trade. Some of Marat's exports are fine furniture and rugs. [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] used some to decorate his barracks. [[Queen Fen\|Queen Fen]] gave [[Shallan\|Shallan]] a fine Marati rug as a wedding gift. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] owns rugs from Marat.
