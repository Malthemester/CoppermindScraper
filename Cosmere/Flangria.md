**Flangria** is a type of meat found on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Flangria is produced via [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]], which makes it far cheaper than other kinds of meat, although some disdain flangria due to its origin. It is often used to cheaply feed large quantities of people, such as bridgemen. It is fried and used in the meatballs for [[Chouta\|chouta]], an inexpensive [[Herdazian\|Herdazian]] food.
