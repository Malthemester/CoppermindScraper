## History
It is not clear how an individual becomes nuatoma, although birth order and heritage are factors in Unkalaki social standing. Since all Unkalaki are [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]], eye color is not a consideration. The relatives of a nuatoma act as their guards and servants, often performing multiple jobs. The relatives are not slaves, and prefer to serve a family member rather than a stranger. When Lunamor sees [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]], who has obvious importance among [[Honorspren\|honorspren]], he asks [[Syl\|Syl]] if she is like a nuatoma.
Lunamor implies that a nuatoma leads each of the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]]. There are occasional skirmishes between peaks, presumably led by the nuatoma.

### Quest for Shards
>‚Äú* The nuatoma, they see our lack of Shards as a great shame. They want these weapons very badly. It is believed that the nuatoma who first obtains a Shardblade would become king, a thing we have not had for many years. No peak would fight another peak where a man held one of the blessed Blades.*‚Äù
\- Lunamor to Kaladin and Teft[1]


The lack of Shards among the Unkalaki is a source of embarrassment for the nuatoma, and many have traveled to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] offering significant financial incentives in exchange for the chance to duel a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and win a Shard. It is assumed that the first nuatoma to win a Shardblade would gain sufficient power to become the first tana'kai‚Äîthe Unkalaki equivalent of a king‚Äîin many years.
All of the nuatoma who have challenged Alethi Shardbearers have been killed. [[Kef'ha\|Kef'ha]], Lunamor's nuatoma, chose to duel [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], believing that his family would simply become servants of House Sadeas if he died. However, Sadeas killed Kef'ha without a proper duel, then killed some of his family members who protested before seizing their property anyway. Sadeas did not know what to do with the surviving Horneaters. Lunamor briefly served as a cook and put [[Chull\|chull]] dung in Sadeas's food, earning him an assignment to the [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]].
After [[Cord\|Cord]] received her Shardplate, Lunamor found it remarkable that their nation‚Äôs first Shardbearer was not a nuatoma, but a young woman.
