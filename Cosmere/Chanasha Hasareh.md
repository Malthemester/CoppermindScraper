**Chanasha Hasareh** is a merchant on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She found modest success hiring out her [[Chull\|chull]] teams to caravans crossing the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] after most of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
Chanasha is [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]], although she is of a low [[Dahn\|dahn]]. She is presumably of the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] faith, as she wears a [[Safehand\|safehand]] sleeve. She is not the smiling type, and seems to be known as a shrewd negotiator. She always carries a reed in her pocket and never lets a day go by without reconciling her accounts. Her name is derived from the herald [[Chanaranach\|Chanaranach]].
She was bribed to hide in a secure location for a month while [[Shallan\|Shallan]] impersonated her as part of an attempt to infiltrate the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]].
