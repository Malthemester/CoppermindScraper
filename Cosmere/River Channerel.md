The **River Channerel** is one of the main rivers in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].
It flows from mountains in the east, providing the border of the [[Northern Dominance\|Northern]] and [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominances]], where it then goes into [[Lake Luthadel\|Lake Luthadel]]. From there, it runs directly through [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], and continues down into the [[Southern Dominance\|Southern Dominance]], all the way into the sea.
In Luthadel it passes under six bridges, including the Old Wall Bridge in the north and Southbridge. A number of tributaries and canals flow into the river in the city and there are some docks and piers both in the center of the city near [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]] and closer to the city walls so boats can stop before going under bridges.
The residents of Luthadel used the river to dispose of waste, especially the ash collected by skaa.
The [[Luth-Davn Canal\|Luth-Davn Canal]] flows into the western bank of the river.
