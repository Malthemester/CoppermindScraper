>‚Äú*Will you be my bride? I want to be married to you. Right now, before the Survivor and that priest. Not because words on a paper say we have to, but because we want to. I'm painfully tired of being alone, Steris. It‚Äôs time I admitted that. And you... well, you‚Äôre incredible. You truly are.*‚Äù

## Appearance
Ahlstrom Tower is a flat-topped building, with a large roof that has enough space for a crowd of people and an airship. The top floor of the tower has a regal looking penthouse apartment. The penthouse contains a bedroom suite with an adjoining balcony that overlooks the city. The tower is tall enough that the stars and [[Red Rip\|Red Rip]] can still be seen in the sky from the balcony, even on nights when the [[Mists\|mists]] are out.

## History
At some point, Waxillium Ladrian purchased an ownership share in Ahlstrom Tower. The people that lived in the penthouse apartment moved to [[Elmsdel\|Elmsdel]] on an extended vacation, leaving the penthouse vacant.
When [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]], [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]], and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] returned to Elendel in the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship, they landed the ship on the roof of Ahlstrom Tower. They met Governor [[Claude Aradel\|Claude Aradel]] and Constable-General [[Reddi\|Reddi]] there on the roof. Wax briefly explained the events surrounding the southerners and the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] that had occurred over the past few days to Aradel, but refused to go in-depth until the next day, as he and his companions were exhausted
Wax led Steris downstairs to the penthouse, where a [[Survivorism\|Survivorist]] priest was waiting for them. Wax asked her to marry him, not as part of a contract between their houses, but rather for love. Steris agreed, and they were married that night. Wax and Steris stayed in the penthouse apartment for the entirety of their honeymoon. While staying there, Wax accessed the [[Coppermind\|coppermind]] given to him by [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. He saw the memory that [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] had stored inside while helping the Southern Scadrians and realized that the Survivor had returned.
After spending time staying in the penthouse, Wax considered relocating from Ladrian mansion to Ahlstrom Tower permanently, believing that skyscrapers were a symbol of a new and more vibrant era.
