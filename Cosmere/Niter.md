## Appearance and Personality
Niter is a tan-skinned [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]], and he wears a short black beard. He presumably wears the dark blue uniform of the Cobalt Guard. He is naturally suspicious, although [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] notes that this is not a bad trait in a bodyguard. He is excited by the prospect of watching a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] in action. [[Zahel\|Zahel]] thought of him as a good man.

## Attributes and Abilities
Although Niter is lighteyed, he is of a low [[Dahn\|dahn]]. He served the Cobalt Guard for years, presumably working his way up to become their captain. He is personally acquainted with the leadership of [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] including Dalinar and [[Adolin\|Adolin]], who hold him in high regard. He is also friends with Zahel and likely worked with him often due to the Cobalt Guard's training in swordsmanship.

## History
It is not known when Niter became head of the Cobalt Guard, but he was part of the group for a number of years. The Guard was well-run under his leadership; the members were exceptionally brave and loyal.
He was present when the Kholins received a messenger from Highprince [[Thanadal\|Thanadal]] declining a meeting with Dalinar. Niter personally helped intercept the messenger and had the Cobalt Guard clear a space around Dalinar and Adolin so that they could discuss the message. Dalinar then asked Niter to retrieve his [[Shardhammer\|Shardhammer]] and Niter seemed to think that he was going to do something impressive with it. Dalinar thought Niter would probably be disappointed since he planned to use the hammer to dig a latrine ditch.
Prior to the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], Niter and the Cobalt Guard helped Adolin prepare for the battle. They brought him his [[Ryshadium\|Ryshadium]], [[Sureblood\|Sureblood]]. Niter presumably died during the battle, as most of the Cobalt Guardsmen were killed fighting alongside Dalinar and Adolin after Sadeas's betrayal. Zahel later said that he died keeping the Kholin men alive.
Niter was succeeded as head of the Cobalt Guard by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], who had great respect for the Guard and integrated the few surviving members with [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]].
Dalinar mentioned that Niter was among the few people he would have trusted to investigate the murders of [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] and [[Vedekar Perel\|Vedekar Perel]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] if he were still alive.
