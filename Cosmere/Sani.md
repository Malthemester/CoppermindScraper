## Appearance and Personality
She is beautiful. She is [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] and has pure black hair. After suffering an injury, she only has four fingers on her left hand.

## History
Around the year 1163, when she was fifteen years old, Sani suffered a serious hand injury. She was treated by [[Lirin\|Lirin]] and a ten-year-old [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], who was in training to be a surgeon. Kaladin showed up late and Lirin had already anesthetized Sani with [[Winterwort\|winterwort]], putting her to sleep while they worked on her hand. Sani's injury was to her safehand and she was only dressed in a shift, but Kaladin did not care, unlike some of his friends. He tried to stay calm and focused.
Sani's injury was not life-threatening, but her hand was mangled; her broken fingers had not been set properly, and the wound was poorly cleaned and bandaged. Lirin was proud that Kaladin correctly discerned that one of the fingers, which had a compound fracture, would need to be removed. Lirin amputated Sani's finger, set the other broken fingers with splints, sutured the wound, and disinfected her hand with [[Lister's oil\|lister's oil]]. Kaladin noted that her family would probably be angry at Lirin since he could not save the finger, even though there was nothing he could have done. However, they would still make a donation that would help his parents buy food.
