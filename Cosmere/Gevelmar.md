Brightlord **Gevelmar** is a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] [[Veden\|Veden]] lord on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
In 1169, Gevelmar arranged for his youngest daughter [[Malise Gevelmar\|Malise]] to marry the much older [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]]. He sent Malise to the Davar estate, along with the appropriate writs of marriage. Gevelmar was a rural lord of little consequence, likely of the fifth or sixth [[Dahn\|dahn]]. The marriage was presumably political in nature since Lin needed a new wife and House Davar still had some prestige at the time.
[[Tavinar\|Tavinar]] knew of Gevelmar.
