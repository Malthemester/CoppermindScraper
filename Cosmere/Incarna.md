The **Incarna** were an ancient people that existed possibly around the time of the ancient Egyptians (judging by [[Allekatrase\|Alcatraz the First's]] sarcophagus).
They created the [[Smedry Talent\|Smedry Talents]] by some unknown process. They fell victim to a terrible calamity that was related to the Talents. Alcatraz the First broke his people's language so that no future generations could use the knowledge to bring destruction to themselves.
Until [[Attica Smedry\|Attica Smedry]] discovered the [[Sands of Rashid\|Sands of Rashid]] (leading to the forging of two pairs of [[Translator's Lenses\|Translator's Lenses]]), nobody was able to read the Incarna language. The race between Alcatraz and Co. and the [[Librarian\|Librarians]] to be the first to find out the Incarna's secrets is one of the major plot lines of the series.
In the fourth book, *Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens*, it is revealed that Attica had found out the Incarna's method for creating talents and intended to give them to everyone, which would result in wide-spread destruction. Alcatraz also found out that his mother had been trying to stop his father from doing this.
