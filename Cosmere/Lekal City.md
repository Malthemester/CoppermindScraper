**Lekal City** is a city in the [[Southern Dominance\|Southern Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. It lies on the [[River Channerel\|River Channerel]] and is downriver from [[Austrex\|Austrex]].

## History
Prior to the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], Lekal City was a country estate, with a manor house but lacked a true palace. It was still notable enough to be on maps dated 1021, shortly before the Collapse. When the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] died, a shantytown sprung up around Lekal City's main manor house.
It is not clear if [[Jastes Lekal\|Jastes Lekal]] made this his capital of his kingdom during the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]] or perhaps the Southern Dominance's capital, [[Austrex\|Austrex]]. Regardless, following Jastes Lekal's demise, King [[Audil Lekal\|Audil Lekal]] was centered out of Lekal City.
[[Sazed\|Sazed]] and [[Breeze\|Breeze]] traveled to Lekal City as ambassadors of the [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture's]] [[New Empire\|New Empire]] prior to the [[Siege of Fadrex City\|Siege of Fadrex City]]. Sazed sought Audil Lekal's surrender, making the Lekal kingdom a vassal to the Empire. Audil eventually signed the treaty, realizing he was beaten.
Nearer to the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], Lekal City was destroyed from lava from a nearby [[Ashmount\|Ashmount]] (presumably the nearby Ashmount Zerinah), and along with it, the entire Southern Dominance was said to be burning.
