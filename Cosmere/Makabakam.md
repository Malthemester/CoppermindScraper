**Makabakam** was the largest of the historic [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Geography
Makabakam took up most of the south-western part of the [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] continent. It shared most of its long northern border with [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]], while in the west, it bordered [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]] (modern [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]) on the [[Misted Mountains\|Misted Mountains]] and to the east, it had a short border with [[Valhav\|Valhav]]. To the south, the country lay on the coast of the [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]] and [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]], and controlled a number of islands dividing those two.
The city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], the home of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], was located within Makabakam borders, but it is unlikely it was actually subject to Makabaki rule. The ancient capital of Makabakam was likely the city currently known as [[Azimir\|Azimir]], as it is there that the state's [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] is located.
In the modern era, Makabakam has split into a number of countries, including [[Alm\|Alm]], [[Azir\|Azir]], [[Desh\|Desh]], [[Emul\|Emul]], [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]], [[Liafor\|Liafor]], [[Marat\|Marat]], [[Steen\|Steen]], [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]], [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]], [[Tukar\|Tukar]], [[Yezier\|Yezier]], and [[Triax\|Triax]] (although Triax lays partly on lands that used to belong to Valhav).

## Culture
The people of Makabakam ancestry are called the Makabaki. They can be recognized by having far darker skin than most Rosharans, although they still have epicanthic folds. There are approximately thirty Makabaki languages, with Azish being the most commonly spoken. The Makabaki worship the Heralds not the Almighty.
In the present day, the region once occupied by Makabakam is called [[Makabak\|Makabak]].
