>“* Your Majesty, I believe it necessary to inform you that the Wode Scroll has once again --*”
\- A letter from Besk to Kairominas [1]


The **Wode Scroll** is a scroll given to [[Liveborn\|Liveborn]] when they reach fifty years of age, the Age of Awareness, and is the only means of communication with the [[Wode\|Wode]]. The one given to [[Kairominas\|Kairominas]] takes the form of the piece of slate. The communication process is very simple; when a message is written onto the Scroll, it gets sent to the Wode, whom can then send a reply that appears on the Scroll.
