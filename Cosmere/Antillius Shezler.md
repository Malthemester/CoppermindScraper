**Antillius Shezler** is a [[Allomancer\|Mistborn]] and [[Noble\|noble]] scholar in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He conducted research into the existence of an [[Malatium\|Eleventh Metal]].

## Appearance and Personality
Shezler wears a fine suit combined with a white shirt buttoned to the neck, and his hair is short, all after the most current trends in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. He also wears a belt that holds his Allomantic metals. Even though Shezler lives in the [[Western Dominance\|Western Dominance]] in the city of [[Mantiz\|Mantiz]], is it no secret that he is completely infatuated with the Luthadel nobility and that he is eager for connections to society closer to the capital. He is presumably wealthy, as he is the lord of a very large keep and employs a number of security guards. He has an arrogant voice, and believes himself to be almost invincible because he is Mistborn. One of his [[Skaa\|skaa]] captives believes that Shezler is not completely sane.

## History
At some point in time Shezler presumably fell under [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] influence. He subsequently started conducting research on a potential Eleventh Metal. He had a hidden underground laboratory and prison at his keep that was accessed through stairs disguised by a groundskeeping shed. In the laboratory, he experimented with metals and tortured skaa in an attempt to find any that could [[Snap\|Snap]] if they had noble blood. He kept the prisoners in filthy conditions and continued to torture them even when it was apparent that they could not Snap. He listed his findings in a notebook.
During [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] training with [[Gemmel\|Gemmel]], the two of them infiltrated [[Keep Shezler\|Keep Shezler]]. They found Shezler's laboratory and his captive skaa, which enraged Kelsier. Shezler discovered them and assumed that they were not a threat to him since he was Mistborn. Shezler nonchalantly [[Steel\|Steelpushed]] a coin at Kelsier, but the latter caught him by surprise by Pushing back, and they started a fight. Shezler was more practiced with [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] than Kelsier, but he lacked experience fighting other strong Allomancers and he was also distracted by his concern for his expensive equipment. Shezler attacked Kelsier with a dueling cane, but Kelsier found a glass shard that he punched into Shezler's neck, and Shezler's [[Pewter\|Pewter]] could not save him. The skaa were set free, although most of them were in severe physical and mental distress.
Kelsier realized that Gemmel intentionally brought him to a place where he would be able to duel another Mistborn; Gemmel considered Shezler to be a "weak" Mistborn since he spent most of his time on scholarly pursuits. Kelsier took Shezler's notebook, presumably beginning his obsession with discovering the Eleventh Metal ([[Malatium\|malatium]]).
