**Kale Tekiel** is a [[Noble\|noble]] in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], shortly before the [[Collapse\|Collapse]].
After [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel's]] reputation and finances were destroyed in the house war, Tekiel tried to leave [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], but the show of weakness was too much for other Luthadel nobility. Some of Tekiel's leadership was assassinated, and the rest had been killed on their canal boats, which were set on fire. This was the work of [[House Hasting\|House Hasting]].
Kale was implied to be one of the Tekiel nobles who were murdered. [[Telden Hasting\|Telden Hasting]] said to [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] that the house war would be no big deal, and that soon everyone would look back and wonder what the fuss was about, but Elend knew the stakes were higher, and Kale certainly wouldn't be able look back, since he was killed with the other Tekiels.
