## Appearance and Personality
Melloni is a young girl who appears to be around seven years old. She is seen wearing purple clothing and accessories, and she sleeps with a teddy bear under a purple blanket. She has brown hair worn in pigtails and tan skin like that of her parents; her mother is ethnically [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] and her father is [[Lossand\|Lossandin]].

## History
Melloni was aware of her mother's dangerous profession as a [[Trackt\|trackt]], and she sometimes worried that Ais would not come home safe. When the investigation into [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]] began to heat up, Ais, fearing for their safety, tried to convince Mellis to take Melloni and seek refuge in the south. Mellis would not listen and stayed in Kezare with Melloni. Ais checked in with her family when she was able, including on her way to meet with [[Raagent\|Raagent]].
After revealing his true identity to Ais, Sharezan went to her house in an attempt to kill Mellis and Melloni as retribution for Ais's investigation. However, [[Kenton\|Kenton]] happened to be there looking for Ais and saved their lives by using [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]] to throw Sharezan through a wall. Mellis expressed regret that he had not fled Kezare with Melloni when Ais asked him to.
After Ais resigned her position as Senior Trackt, Melloni joined her family on a journey to [[Ker Kedasha\|Ker Kedasha]] where Ais hoped to find spiritual guidance from the [[A'Kar\|A'Kar]].
