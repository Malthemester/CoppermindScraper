## Appearance and Personality
Szeth's highspren appears, as all highspren do, as a black slit in the fabric of reality with a void of stars within. The air seems to warp around it. It is capable of making itself invisible whenever it wants, and in fact typically remains invisible. Presumably it looks like a human-shaped but otherwise similar void in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. While highspren appear to have genders Szeth's [[Spren\|spren]] has not yet revealed what its gender is.
Szeth's spren acts very reserved towards Szeth, keeping its tone formal and addressing him as acolyte. It hasn't even told him its name yet. It does not talk to him or show itself to him often. The spren seems to act as a judge of Szeth in some regard, as it judges both Szeth's worthiness and the truth as it pertains to what Szeth says. It approves of him swearing the Third Ideal and wishes him to continue by completing the Fourth Ideal.

## Attributes and Abilities
Szeth's spren can make itself invisible. It is likely that it can exert a small amount of force in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], since many other Nahel spren can do this.

### Nahel Bond
Its bond with Szeth gives it sentience in the Physical Realm and grants Szeth the [[Surges\|Surges]] of [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]] and [[Division\|Division]]. This bond is strengthened as Szeth swears additional [[Immortal Words\|Ideals]]. Since Szeth is of the Third Oath, his spren should be able to form a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], but it has yet to do so.

## History
It bonded Szeth at some point before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. During the battle, Szeth swore his Third Ideal and the highspren approved. Since then, it has remained by his side, always judging his worthiness. While Szeth was guarding [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]] and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] on the [[Emul\|Emuli]] front, his highspren chose to show himself to him in order to give him direction on his progression through the Ideals. It told him he needed to complete his Fourth Ideal quest soon, and that he needed to rely more on his own judgement rather than that of Dalinar as part of his progress towards this Fifth Ideal.
