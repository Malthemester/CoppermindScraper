The **Great Concourse of Kharbranth** is a school training surgeons in the city of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Tuition is quite expensive and they don't admit students younger than sixteen.
Vathe, a resident of [[Shorsebroon\|Shorsebroon]] in the [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], trained as a surgeon in the Concourse. At some point after Vathe settled in Shorsebroon, he took on [[Lirin\|Lirin]] as his apprentice.
Before joining the army, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] planned to apply to study and train at the Concourse. After [[Roshone\|Roshone]] moved to [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] and began targeting Kaladin's family, Lirin and [[Hesina\|Hesina]] sent a letter to the surgeons of the Concourse requesting permission for Kaladin to sit the entrance exams early. Unfortunately, their request was denied.
