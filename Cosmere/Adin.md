## Appearance and Personality
Adin is a thirteen-year-old darkeyed boy. He is very brave, risking his life in the fight to escape Urithiru. He hopes that his bravery will attract an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] and allow him to join the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]]. This belief caused him to glare at passing [[Regals\|Regals]] during the occupation of Urithiru, though not when they were watching. He is relieved when he can walk without a limp after hurting his ankle, as he believes that a sign of weakness might scare off a potential radiant bond.

## History
Adin was a resident of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. He worked for his father, a potter named [[Alalan\|Alalan]], though the bowls he made were often lopsided. Sometime before [[Raboniel\|Raboniel's]] invasion of the tower, he fell down the stairs while pretending to be a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]], after which [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] bandaged his ankle. During the occupation of Urithiru, Kaladin saved his life with his [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]].

## Relationships
### Alalan
Adin's father. When Alalan catches Adin glaring at the [[Regals\|Regals]], he warns him to keep his eyes down, lest he is caught and killed. Adin views his father as extremely brave for tending the fallen radiants directly beneath the gaze of the [[Fused\|Fused]].

### Kaladin
Adin respects and reveres [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], viewing him with a sense of awe. He is embarrassed that he missed seeing Kaladin fight for the well node, an event that he napped through.

### Shar
[[Shar\|Shar]] is a fellow resident of Urithiru which Adin doesn't particularly like. He thinks that she is bossy enough that you would think she was lighteyed. Her uncle is a Windrunner. When Adin catches her glaring at [[Regals\|Regals]] he thinks that she is trying to attract her own [[Honorspren\|honorspren]].
