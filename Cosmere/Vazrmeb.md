**Vazrmeb** is the captain of the ship *First Dreams* on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and personality
Vazrmeb is [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] and has the long white eyebrows characteristic of his people. He has long, curly hair. He is unusually tall for a Thaylen, as tall as a typical [[Alethi\|Alethi]], and has large arms and hands. [[Kaza\|Kaza]] remarks that he does not conform to the stereotypical image of Thaylens as parsimonious merchants. He is boisterous and appears to be a skilled captain, as he is able to keep his crew organized through a deadly storm.

## History
Vazrmeb was infatuated with the legends of hidden riches on [[Akinah\|Akinah]] in [[Aimia\|Aimia]]. Although most Rosharans considered Akinah unreachable, he and his helmsman [[Droz\|Droz]] sought to travel to the island. Few sailors were willing to attempt this journey, so Vazrmeb hired a mercenary crew in [[Steen\|Steen]]. It is not clear whether he owned the ship *First Dreams* or if it was chartered. He had at least some prior knowledge of the stone spikes blocking entry to Akinah, and hired Kaza in [[Liafor\|Liafor]] (at great expense) to Soulcast them into smoke.
*First Dreams* sailed north from [[Liafor\|Liafor]] and encountered a massive storm on the [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]] that abruptly ended near Akinah. Kaza was able to Soulcast the spikes, allowing the crew to approach the island in dinghies. However, Vazrmeb had been poisoned and killed along with the rest of the crew by the ship's cook, a [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] posing as a human. Kaza was the only person besides the cook to reach the shore alive, and before she ended her life she noticed that the island did in fact appear to contain the [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] that Vazrmeb was seeking. However, these gemhearts would later prove to be fake.
[[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] later learned of Vazrmeb's ambition from the prince of [[Liafor\|Liafor]] while investigating the mysterious reappearance of the *First Dreams* as a ghost ship, although she did not know his fate.
