**ShalRim** is a [[Dayside\|Daysider]] fabric on [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. It is known for being strong as well as comfortable. [[Raagent\|Raagent]] preferred ShalRim over [[Darkside\|Darkside]] materials for his bed sheets. The material is strong enough that [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]] was able to use Raagent's ShalRim blanket to securely tie him up.
