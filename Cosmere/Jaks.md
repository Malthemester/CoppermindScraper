## Appearance and Personality
Like many of the other Bridge Four members, Earless Jaks did not take kindly to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]‚Äôs leadership at first, and was openly hostile towards him. He gained respect for Kaladin over time, becoming a willing part of the team.

## Attributes and Abilities
Jaks had some level of artistic ability, as he was chosen to paint designs on carapace armor designed by [[Leyten\|Leyten]].

## History
It is not known how Jaks became a bridgeman or how he lost his ears‚Äîin fact, it is not clear if he was actually earless, or if it was just a nickname.
When Kaladin got the squad assigned to stone gathering duty (while secretly gathering [[Knobweed\|knobweed]] sap), Earless Jaks approached him with [[Dunny\|Dunny]], towing a wooden sled bearing a large stone. As they loaded the boulder into the wagon, Earless Jaks scowled at Kaladin. When Kaladin complimented him, Earless Jaks just glared at him and stalked off. His contempt for Kaladin continued during chasm duty, joining in when [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] and [[Moash\|Moash]] gibed the bridgeleader.

>‚Äú*He cares about looking important. Even if he was in the army, I‚Äôll bet he spent his days cleaning out latrines.*‚Äù

After Kaladin performed an advanced kata, Earless Jaks was presumably among the bridgemen who gained a newfound respect for Kaladin. He questioned Kaladin's plan to escape the warcamps, but was presumably among the bridgemen who agreed to learn how to fight after realizing that there was no good alternative. After Bridge Four secured [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] carapaces and Leyten fashioned armor from them, Earless Jaks purchased blue and white paint and drew designs on the new armor.
Jaks died in the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]] alongside [[Malop\|Malop]] and [[Narm\|Narm]]. Kaladin lamented that he couldn‚Äôt save the three of them, although he tried his best to focus on the fact that the others had survived.
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] remembered him along with [[Malop\|Malop]], [[Beld\|Beld]], [[Pedin\|Pedin]], [[Rod\|Rod]], [[Mart\|Mart]], [[Goshel\|Goshel]], [[Nalma\|Nalma]], [[Dallet\|Dallet]] and the squad, and [[Tien\|Tien]] while trying, and failing, to say the [[Immortal Words\|Fourth Ideal]] of the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]]. Kaladin remembered failing Jaks and other members of Bridge Four when [[Moash\|Moash]] confronted him in [[Toralin Roshone\|Toralin Roshone's]] manor.
