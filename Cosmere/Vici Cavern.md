**Vici Cavern** is a human-inhabited cavern on [[Detritus\|Detritus]].
They are descendants from marines of *Defiant*, and are rumored to be great warriors. They have a separate culture and mostly keep to themselves.
[[Morningtide\|Morningtide]] is a **Vician**. English is not her first language, which may mean the Vician's are also not English speakers. Additionally, they may have a distinct accent from those that live in other caverns. [[Spensa\|Spensa]] also noted that she had a tattoo across her jaw that seemed to identify her as Vician.
