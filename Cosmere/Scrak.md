**Scrak** is an [[Axehound\|axehound]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] owned by [[Balat Davar\|Balat Davar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Scrak has a typical axehound appearance with six legs, an angular head, antennae, and a segmented hide. She belongs to one of the smaller, sleeker axehound breeds, although she still weighs nearly as much as a grown man.
Scrak is loyal, playful, and mischievous. She trumpets when she sees her master and leans on him to get rubs behind her ear holes. She often plays around the sitting green at the [[House Davar\|Davar]] family manor, catching [[Songling\|songlings]] and rolling around with them before biting off their legs. She does tend to ignore Balat's commands on little things, such as failing to share her kills with him, but he does not get truly annoyed and sees her independent streak as a sign of intelligence.

## History
It is not clear how Balat acquired Scrak, although he is known to have started breeding axehounds in his youth, presumably learning about it from his father [[Lin\|Lin]]. Although Balat sometimes exhibited cruelty towards animals (including axehounds), he was generally known to love the axehound pups that he bred. Balat's attitude towards Scrak implied that he had owned her for a long time, likely since she was very young.
It is not known if Balat still had Scrak after the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] helped the Davar sons escape the strife in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] to meet up with [[Shallan\|Shallan]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
