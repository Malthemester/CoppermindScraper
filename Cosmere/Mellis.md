## Appearance and Personality
Mellis has brown hair and tan skin. He is of average height, with an athletic build. He seems to support Ais in her work as a [[Trackt\|trackt]], but is nervous about the danger it creates for their family. Mellis is Lossandin, unlike his wife Ais, who is [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]].

## History
Mellis lived in Lossand with Ais and Melloni. Due to Ais's long and irregular hours, he would take care of the household, performing tasks such as cooking meals and caring for Melloni.
After Ais apprehended [[Lokmlen\|Lokmlen]], she returned home and was greeted by Mellis and Melloni. After Melloni went to bed, Ais told Mellis that [[Jedan\|Jedan]] had been killed during the pursuit. Mellis was empathetic, but he also showed Ais a note threatening her family that was left at their home. Ais believed the note to be an idle threat from [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]], but Mellis was worried.
Ais became increasingly conflicted about her assignment as a bodyguard for [[Kenton\|Kenton]] and found herself in highly dangerous situations. At the same time, she came to believe that Sharezan was more powerful than she first thought, and she became worried about her family's safety. She told Mellis to take Melloni to an undisclosed location south of [[Kezare\|Kezare]] to seek sanctuary until Sharezan was caught. Mellis was hesitant since that meant the family might not be together for months. Ais was insistent, but Mellis stayed anyway.
Ais checked in with Mellis on her way to meet with [[Raagent\|Raagent]].
Sharezan went to Ais's house to try to kill Mellis and Melloni as revenge on Ais but [[Kenton\|Kenton]], who happened to have been there, saved their lives by using his [[Sand mastery\|sand]] to throw Sharezan through a wall. Mellis expressed regret for not leaving the city, as Ais had suggested.
When Ais told Mellis that she was going on a trip to the [[A'Kar\|A'Kar]] for spiritual guidance, he insisted on going with her even though Lossandins were not welcome in [[Ker Kedasha\|Ker Kedasha]].

## Trivia
In the unpublished [[White Sand (prose)\|prose version of White Sand]], Ais was male, and Mellis was his wife.
