\-Dink to Alcatraz[1]


**Dink** is one of [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz Smedry's]] [[Mokia\|Mokian]] advisors during the battle for [[Tuki Tuki\|Tuki Tuki]]. He advises Alcatraz along with the other two advisors, [[Mink (Alcatraz)\|Mink]] and [[Wink\|Wink]], with whom he is not related.

## Appearance and Personality
Dink is large, wide, and thick-bodied. He is husky and has a small head, and Alcatraz likens him to a two-liter bottle of soda.

## History
During the battle, Dink gives Alcatraz information on the Mokian defenses such as the dome, and how long they’ll hold. At Alcatraz’ orders, Dink and the other counselors went to fetch him some backpacks full of explosive teddy bears, six of their fastest warriors, and a pair of very long stilts. They hesitated briefly, but did as asked.
