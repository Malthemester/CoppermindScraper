## Appearance and Personality
>“*Good riddance.*”
\-Edgli on Uli Da's death[4]


Edgli's appearance and even species are unknown; when speaking to the [[Returned\|Returned]], she has a calm, comforting voice. To them, she is gentle and kind, offering the possibility of coming back without pressuring them into it. In private, however, she's a lot less personable. She's uninterested in meddling with the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] beyond [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], and dislikes the idea of [[Shard\|Shards]] interfering with one another; at the same time, she meddles with Nalthis itself extensively through the Returned. She's said to be erratic, particularly when it comes to the manner in which she picks the people to Return.
Though she calls [[Hoid\|Hoid]] "Dearest Cephandrius", she seems to dislike him quite heavily; she is frustrated with his visits to her territory, chastises him for refusing to become a Vessel, and generally tells him off for trying to interfere with the matters above what she perceives to be his weight class. She appears to be more amicable when speaking with [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. While it might be due to both of them being Shards, she does not extend the same courtesy to [[Uli Da\|Uli Da]], and is dismissive of [[Aona\|Aona]] and [[Skai\|Skai's]] fate.

## Abilities and Attributes
For the powers of Endowment, see Endowment#Associated Magic.
As a Vessel of the Shard [[Endowment\|Endowment]], Edgli is immortal and immensely powerful; she can even bring the recently-dead back to life through bestowing her [[Splinter\|splinters]], Divine [[Breath\|Breath]], upon them. Like other Shards, she is capable of perceiving the future, though it's unknown how good she is at it. She does, however, rank higher than most in being able to spot [[Hoid\|Hoid]], as she declares herself perfectly capable of detecting his "intrusions" on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] regardless of what disguise he uses. It's unclear whether this is some capacity granted to her by her particular Shard, or simply her own keen mind.

## History
Like all original Vessels, Edgli is a native of [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. She participated in the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and took up one of the Shards, [[Endowment\|Endowment]]. Honoring the deal that the Vessels made, to each go their own ways, she set out of Yolen and eventually wound up on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], Investing herself in it and becoming its sole Shard.

For subsequent events, see Endowment#History.
## Trivia
Edgli is the author of the first of the [[Letters\|letters]] in *Oathbringer* epigraphs.
The "E" in her name is pronounced as "eh", like in the word "echo".
Brandon has repeatedly avoided stating whether or not Edgli is a [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragon]].
