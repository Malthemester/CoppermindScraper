## Geography and Ecology
The borders of the Eastern Crownlands include the princedoms of [[Bethab\|Bethab]], [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]], [[House Kholin\|Kholin]], and [[Thanadal\|Thanadal]]. The Crownlands form the eastern shore of the [[Sea of Spears\|Sea of Spears]]; the area is also bordered by the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]] to the west and the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] to the south.
It is the part of Alethkar closest to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] and presumably gets hit quite hard by [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. It contains most of the [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend River]], including several tributaries. The Sea of Spears is technically a lake and is often referred to as such; its waters also flow into the Deathbend. The city of [[Rathalas\|Rathalas]] sits in a canyon carved into rocky terrain at the north end of the lake, giving it the nickname "the Rift". Other land around the lake consists of plains, and includes riverbeds that are dry unless there has been a recent storm. [[Rockbud\|Rockbuds]] on the plains consume large amounts of water when it is available and grow to massive sizes, with trunks as tall as a man's waist and vines as thick as a wrist.
Rathalas was once the largest city in the area, although it was reduced to ruins. Somewhere to the southeast of Rathalas is the waystop [[Vedelliar\|Vedelliar]], although it is unknown whether this town lies within the Eastern Crownlands or the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]]. In the [[Shadesmar\|Cognitive Realm]], the spren city of [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] can be found near Rathalas, on an island that corresponds to the Sea of Spears.

## History
The Eastern Crownlands were conquered by [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] during his quest to unite Alethkar into a single kingdom. Prior to this, the land was part of a princedom. The Crownlands became the property of the king, providing income to the throne and lands for the king to award to lords.
The city of Rathalas and its leaders rebelled against Gavilar's rule both before and after the unification of the country. Gavilar believed that the rebellion in Rathalas could lead the entirety of the Crownlands to attempt secession. After attempts to politically quell the situation failed, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] and [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] marched on Rathalas and razed the city to set an example for the other highprinces. During this battle, Dalinar's wife, [[Evi Kholin\|Evi Kholin]], was accidentally killed on Dalinar's orders. Her death was blamed on the rebels as a cover-up.
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Dalinar awarded some land in the area to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], noting that it may have already been occupied by the [[Singer\|singer]] forces that were invading Alethkar.

## Culture
People of the Eastern Crownlands, particularly those from Rathalas, have a distinctive nasal accent.
If a landholder in the Crownlands dies without an heir, the land reverts back to the throne.
