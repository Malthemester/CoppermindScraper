**Cambri** is the supposed homeworld of the [[Taynix\|taynix]]. Due to [[Superiority\|Superiority]] propaganda regarding this species, it is unclear if this is true.
According to the Superiority, the taynix escaped Cambri on early trading vessels, and are considered an invasive species on many planets. However, it is possible the taynix [[Cytonics\|cytonically]] teleported to other locations, and this story is a cover for that fact.
The [[Cambric\|cambric]]--one of the five species that head the government in the Superiority--may be from Cambri, due to the similarities in their names.
