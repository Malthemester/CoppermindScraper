For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[Perfect State/Summary\|/Summary]].
God-Emperor Kairominas is lord of all he surveys. He has defeated all foes, has united the entire world beneath his rule, and has mastered the arcane arts. He spends his time sparring with his nemesis, who keeps trying to invade Kai's world.
Except for today. Today, Kai has to go on a date.
Forces have conspired to require him to meet with his equalâ€”a woman from another world who has achieved just as much as he has. What happens when the most important man in the world is forced to have dinner with the most important woman in the world?

## Behind the Scenes
Brandon wrote the original draft of *Perfect State* in the summer of 2011. It went through his writing group during the late fall of 2012. Brandon then sat on it because there was something wrong with it but he could not tell what it was. In December 2014 he revisited the story, revising it and expanding it over the course of a week.
*Perfect State* will be bundled together with *Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell* in a hardcover edition for the 2015 Con Exclusive.

## Awards
