## Appearance and Personality
He is an older man with blue eyes and a beard. He wears a felt cap. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] is unable to place his accent, but believes that he is neither [[Alethi\|Alethi]] nor [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]]. He seems to have a genial disposition even in grim situations. He is a high-end merchant and has a distaste for slavers.

## Attributes and Abilities
Macob is a trademaster, although it is unclear if this refers to the title as used in the Thaylen tradition. Although he tries to negotiate with Shallan, he capitulates easily when she makes demands of him. He is particularly respectful towards her after learning that she has a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], and he assures her that he can be discreet. He is able to competently lead a large caravan that includes families with small children.
Macob employs [[Tyn\|Tyn]], an associate of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]], as a scout and guard captain. However, she had recently conned her way into his caravan by exaggerating her experience, and there is no indication that Macob knew of her other activities.

## History
During their journey to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in 1173, [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv]], and his mercenaries spotted smoke coming from Macob's caravan after it was attacked by bandits. These bandits attacked the caravan with firebrands, setting some of the wagons on fire and then pulling back (allowing the caravaneers to fatigue themselves putting out the fires) before attacking again.
Tyn approached Shallan's caravan and informed her about the danger of the bandits. This led [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to convince [[Vathah\|Vathah]] and his band of deserters to fight on her behalf. They joined together with Macob's caravan and were able to defeat the bandits, although some lives were lost in the process.
Macob subsequently worked out a deal with Shallan wherein they would travel to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] together while under the protection of "her" men; in exchange, he would provide her with supplies throughout the journey. The supplies included a [[Chull\|chull]] and fine [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] food and clothing. Macob learned that Shallan had a Shardblade after she used it to kill Tyn in self-defense, and he parted ways with her after reaching the warcamps.
