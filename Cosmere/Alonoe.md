## Appearance and Personality
Like many of the other members of the Ire, Alonoe is incredibly old. She has silvery skin that glows faintly, typical of [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]]. Although aging works differently in the Cognitive Realm, she is wizened, bald, and has puckered lips. [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] describes her as a "dried up" ancient creature that is not immediately recognizable as human. As a member of the Ire, she wears a traditional hooded white robe with silver embroidery. Her robe has thicker bands of silver than those of her colleagues. She is imperious and appears to be an authority figure within the Ire.

## Attributes and Abilities
As an Elantrian, Alonoe would presumably have the power to use [[AonDor\|AonDor]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. However, Selish magic is known to function poorly off-world and although Alonoe and the rest of the Ire remain Elantrians in their current location, they are not able to access the [[Dor\|Dor]]. Alonoe is also a [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]] since she was able to travel to the Cognitive Realm and move between planetary systems. She appears to be an overbearing but effective leader, as she is able to keep the Ire focused on the plan to acquire the power of a [[Shard\|Shard]]. Her plan may have been successful had Kelsier not interfered, although she was not fully prepared for the ramifications of ascension.

## History
The Ire is an extremely old organization and Alonoe's physical appearance and her authority within the Ire imply that she has been a member for a very long time. At some point, the Ire constructed a fortress on the edge of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial's]] Cognitive Realm. The members of the Ire were not on Sel when the [[Reod\|Reod]] occurred, but they were affected by it in some way.
Alonoe was present in the Ire's fortress when [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] found it and attempted to investigate it. When one of the Ire's guardsmen spotted Kelsier, he and the guard captain reported the incident to Alonoe, whom they saluted and addressed as "ancient one". Alonoe had been wary of intrusions by [[Shade\|shades]] from [[Threnody\|Threnody]], and assumed that Kelsier was one of them. She instructed the guard captain to turn on a special device that contained a large yellow gemstone, hoping to detect any Threnodites nearby. Although the device did not detect Kelsier since he was Scadrian, she told the guards and the rest of the Ire that they needed to stay alert.
The Ire discussed their plan to seize the power of [[Preservation\|Preservation]] when its [[Vessel\|Vessel]], [[Leras\|Leras]], died. Alonoe was concerned about [[Ruin\|Ruin]], but she would not let him deter the plan. Kelsier was irritated by Alonoe's ambition, partly because he had befriended Leras (whom he called "Fuzz"). He discovered the key to the Ire's plan, a [[Ire's orb\|magical orb]] that could provide the [[Connection\|Connection]] necessary for someone to ascend as Preservation. They planned to use wards to prevent Ruin from noticing the device. Kelsier decided to thwart the Ire by stealing the orb.
About a week later, Alonoe led an expedition of five members of the Ire and fifteen guards who rode from the keep on horseback, intending to take control of Preservation. Although four of the Ire members carried decoy orbs, Kelsier correctly guessed that Alonoe would not allow the real orb to leave her possession. He began to sow seeds of chaos, pretending to be Ruin and whispering disturbing things into Alonoe's ears. Alonoe was determined to persevere, but Kelsier's antics prevented the group from sleeping and led to confusion and infighting. When the expedition approached a jungle, Kelsier seized the opportunity to scare the group's horses and isolate Alonoe amidst the vegetation. Using one of Alonoe's robes that he stole from the fortress, he tricked the rest of the group into thinking that she had disintegrated, scaring them away. He then doubled back to confront a terrified Alonoe, who believed he was Ruin and gave up the orb. Alonoe even offered to serve Ruin, but Kelsier dismissed her, forcing her to walk to find her companions.
