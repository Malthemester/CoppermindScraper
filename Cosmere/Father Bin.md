**Father Bin** is a [[Survivorism\|Survivorist]] priest from [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He was supposed to be the priest performing [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] and [[Steris\|Steris's]] wedding.
Prior to the mistdawn sermon, the rogue [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[Paalm\|Paalm]], disguised as a [[Pathian\|Pathian]] priest named [[Larskpur\|Larskpur]], nailed Father Bin through his eyes to the wall in the chapel while he was still alive, then covered him over with a draping. After people arrived for the service, Paalm started preaching, telling the Survivorists that [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] was a false god who had cared only about himself, before revealing Father Bin's corpse. By doing so, Paalm exacerbated tensions between Survivorists and Pathians, pushing [[Elendel\|Elendel]] further toward rioting.
