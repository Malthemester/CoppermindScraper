## Appearance and Personality
He has a long face. While serving as a bridgeman, he was somber and withdrawn, and rarely spoke. After the liberation of Bridge Four, he became far more outgoing and jocular. He expresses loyalty to Kaladin and his comrades-in-arms.

## Attributes and Abilities
Natam is presumably skilled with a spear, as he and [[Leyten\|Leyten]] hold morning practice sessions to train Bridge Four's new recruits; Kaladin suggests that [[Shen\|Shen]] train with them.
As a Windrunner, he is able to breathe in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. This gives him some magical abilities, including healing and the power of flight using Basic Lashings.

## History
Natam was once a farmer, and he spoke with a rural Alethi accent. It is unknown how he came to serve in [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] bridge crews.
Natam was present in the early days of Kaladin's time in the bridge crews. When Kaladin got [[Gaz\|Gaz]] to assign Bridge Four stone-gathering duty so they could covertly search for [[Knobweed\|knobweed]], he tried to engage with Natam, who was putting forth minimal effort. Natam did not want to speak to Kaladin and seemed ambivalent about the changes that were occurring, and Kaladin realized that he needed to give the bridgemen something to live for besides simply surviving. After some time training with Kaladin, Natam began to see value in his leadership. He was presumably present with the rest of Bridge Four when Kaladin was judged by the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] and was subsequently a fixture in Bridge Four.
He became trained with the spear, and was among the bridgemen who served as the honor guard for the [[House Kholin\|Kholin family]]. He and [[Mart\|Mart]] were assigned to guard [[Navani\|Navani]] on the night that King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] nearly fell off his balcony in a suspected assassination attempt. He helped save Elhokar, and was the first person to inform Kaladin about what had happened. Kaladin asked Natam more questions about that night while they were training to ride horses with [[Jenet\|Jenet]]. Natam remembered seeing [[Moash\|Moash]] on the balcony, which was one of the clues that led Kaladin to confront Moash about his involvement in the assassination plot.
Natam presumably participated in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and was present in the city after humans captured it from the [[Listeners\|listeners]]. He was among the members of Bridge Four that discussed using their [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] [[Squire\|squire]] abilities before expressing unease about [[Renarin\|Renarin]] learning how to read.

## Trivia
Natam is a cameo for a friend of Brandon's named Nathan Goodrich. In a Reddit AMA, Nathan mentioned that he was in Brandon's reading group at BYU and joked that his name had to be changed because "Nathan" is too symmetrical for a [[Vorin\|Vorin]] society.
