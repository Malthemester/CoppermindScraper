This article is about a [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] plant.Â For a [[Skaa\|skaa]] from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], see [[Shum\|Shum]].
**Shum** is a plant on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
The appearance and properties of the plant are unknown. It is presumably grown in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], as [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]] traded in raw shum. Lin was at one point forced to sell raw shum, along with [[Breachtree\|breachtree]] cotton, to [[Revilar\|Revilar]] at a devastating discount in order to gain influence. Revilar's interest in shum implies that it can be used to create textiles.
