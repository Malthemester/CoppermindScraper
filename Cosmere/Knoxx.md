## History
Knoxx is a member of Newton's gang, and has been for years. He was not an Epic when he joined, but was given his powers by [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]] at the request of [[Regalia\|Regalia]]. [[David\|David]] attempted to draw him into a trap in a office building, with [[Megan Tarash\|Megan]] in a sniper position. Knoxx thought it was just some kid scavenging for food. David ambushed Knoxx, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, but Knoxx escaped by turning into a pigeon and flying to a different floor. Megan took a few shots at him, and Knoxx started to make a run for it. David caught up to him, and Knoxx attacked David as a large black dog. Knoxx got sprayed in the face with bright blue spraypaint making him easier to identify. During the fight, Megan shot him in the shoulder from her position. Knoxx was wounded, not able to fully fly as a pigeon. However, he managed to escape to the next building over, where he collapsed. David caught up to him and tied him up, and proceeded to wait for Megan to arrive. [[Valentine\|Val]] showed up, fatally shooting Knoxx in the head and saying that “The only good Epic is a dead Epic.”
