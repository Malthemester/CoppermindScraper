## History
The flight participated in the [[Second Battle of Alta\|Second Battle of Alta]], and was the eleventh flight to join the group sent to defend the shipyard. When the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] sent their battleship forward to begin bombarding [[Detritus\|Detritus]], Ivy Flight was one of the flights sent up to fight off the [[KRELL\|Krell]] so that [[FM\|FM]] could disable the cannon. When the Engineering Corps got the planetary shield up, two members of Ivy Flight were left stuck outside the shield, and met up with [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] and several other ships so that Jorgen could use the [[Taynix\|taynix]] to teleport them inside Detritus’ shield. The other surviving members of the flight presumably retreated back to [[Platform Prime\|Platform Prime]] on [[Matthew Cobb\|Cobb’s]] orders.
When [[Superiority\|Superiority]] forces attacked the planet [[Evershore (planet)\|Evershore]], Ivy Flight was one of the flights called into action to protect the planet, alongside [[Stardragon Flight\|Stardragon Flight]] and [[Victory Flight\|Victory Flight]]. Ivy Flight had a few taynix, and used them to hyperjump to Evershore. Ivy Flight and Stardragon Flight were assigned by Jorgen to protect the city of [[Dreamspring\|Dreamspring]], intercepting enemy fighters before they got within firing range of the city. At least one member of the flight was shot down during the ensuing fight, when a Superiority [[Cytonics\|cytonic]] used mindblades during combat.
