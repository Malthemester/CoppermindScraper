**Jam** is a man from the town of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] in rural [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is two years older than [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]].

## History
Jam's father served as a soldier in [[Meridas Amaram\|Brightlord Amaram's]] army; he was well known to [[Lirin\|Lirin]] because he had operated multiple times on a lingering leg injury. When Kaladin was ten years old, he and [[Tien\|Tien]] liked to watch Jam train in the quarterstaff with his father. Lirin doubted that Jam actually wanted to hang out with the younger boys.
Jam still lived in Hearthstone at the time of its evacuation to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on the *Fourth Bridge* in 1175. He moved to the tower and lived with the rest of the refugees on the sixth floor. When [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] and her forces invaded the tower, he found a spear somewhere and tried to resist them; he was the only refugee that was injured. [[Hesina\|Hesina]] presumably tended to his wounds.
