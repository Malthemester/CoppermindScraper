>“*Roshar (which--characteristic of the dominant confidence of its people--is the name of a planet, a system, and the main continent on the planet) is a busy place. As empty as the Scadrian system seems, this one always feels crowded to me.*”
\-From Khriss' essay on Roshar[1]


The **Rosharan system**, also known as **Greater Roshar**, is the name given to the planetary system containing the [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] called [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It comprises thirteen planets, three of which are inhabited, as well as the usual asteroid belt, and three moons for a total of sixteen orbital bodies -- an important number in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].

## Planets
The Greater Roshar system is composed of three terrestrial planets and ten gas giants, divided by the asteroid belt. In order from the sun, the terrestrial planets are:


This is where [[The Silence Divine\|The Silence Divine]] is set. While there are humans inhabiting this planet, a global cataclysm at some point in the past has forced most of its inhabitants to flee to Roshar, while the remainder lives in floating cities in the sky. The cataclysm was likely caused by overuse of [[Surge\|Surges]] by Ashynites, and has left the surface highly volcanically active. There is a known manifestation of Investiture on Ashyn, based around Surge-granting diseases, but no known Shard.

The second planet is the eponymous Shardworld of Greater Roshar, and the primary setting of the [[Stormlight Archive\|Stormlight Archive]]. The [[Shard\|Shards]] of [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] can be found here. Roshar features a single supercontinent, also called Roshar, on which its inhabitants live. Three moons, Salas, Nomon, and Mishim, orbit the planet. The majority of Roshar's sentient lifeforms lives on Roshar.


A cold planet, perhaps outside the habitable zone. While no humans live here, there do exist self-aware Splinters that inhabit either the planet or its Cognitive manifestation. Braize is where the Shard of [[Odium\|Odium]] resides. In Rosharan mythology, Braize is referred to as Damnation, and is where Rosharan Heralds returned to between [[Desolation\|Desolations]].
Beyond the asteroid belt are ten gas giants. These outer planets, which are designated by [[Ten Essences\|Vorin numerals]], are **Jes**, **Nan**, **Chach**, **Vev**, **Palah**, **Shash**, **Betab**, **Kak**, **Tanat**, and **Ishi**, in order of increasing distance from the sun. The Rosharan gas giants have a minor presence on Shadesmar, which indicates that they are uninhabited. None of these planets have moons or ring systems.

## Astronomy
In the greater Cosmere, the Rosharan system lies between [[Taldain\|Taldain]], [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] and [[Sel\|Sel]], and is the closest to the latter. It is one of the stars in the Knight constellation. In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], Shadesmar is surrounded by four Expanses; the [[Expanse of the Vapors\|Expanse of the Vapors]] leads to Scadrial, the [[Expanse of the Densities\|Expanse of the Densities]] leads to Sel, and the [[Expanse of Vibrance\|Expanse of Vibrance]] is believed to lead to Nalthis. It is currently unknown which Shardworld the [[Expanse of the Broken Sky\|Expanse of the Broken Sky]] leads to.

## Inhabitants
The Rosharan system is inhabited by several sentient species. This includes humans on both Ashyn and Roshar; [[Singers\|Singers]], [[Siah Aimian\|Siah Aimians]] and the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] on Roshar; and a vast number of sentient [[Spren\|spren]]. Braize also contains a large population of [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]] of Singers, called the [[Fused\|Fused]], who migrate to Roshar during [[Desolation\|Desolations]].
It is likely that Roshar saw several waves of human immigration, as the [[Iriali\|Iriali]] may be later arrivals than other Rosharan humans.

## History
The Rosharan system was created prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], and was crafted directly by Adonalsium.
The system was created for a specific purpose. The Rosharan spren [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] and the [[Singers\|Singers]] likely predate it as well.
After the Shattering, the Shards Honor and Cultivation settled on Roshar, becoming the gods of Singer people. Humans initially settled on Ashyn, but following the destruction of its environment, migrated to Roshar, and were granted the land that comprises modern [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. The Shard Odium arrived on Roshar alongside them, and while the Singers believe it to be the human god, the exact relation is unclear. Honor trapped Odium in the system by unknown means, and the shard settled on Braize. However, when the relationship between humans and Singers deteriorated to the point of war, Odium took the Singers under his wing, creating the first Fused and starting the cycle of Desolations, periodic invasions of Roshar. During that time, Honor was killed by Odium, but his pact with Odium, along with the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] that governs the Desolations, prevented Odium from leaving the system.
Over the past 4.5 thousand years, the Rosharan system has enjoyed a period of relative stability, although this ended with the start of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].

## Mythology
Several of the Rosharan system's celestial bodies have legends associated with them.

### The planets
Ashyn, though not known by that name to Roshar's inhabitants, is likely the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]], the mythological homeworld of mankind in the [[Vorinism\| Vorin]] creation myth. Rosharans believe that after death, they will fight to reclaim them from the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]], and that this is where the Heralds departed to following the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]]. Braize, on the other hand, is a known name for [[Damnation\|Damnation]], the place where, in Rosharan myths and legends, Voidbringers live. In Vorin cosmology, Damnation is the afterlife for particularly wicked souls.

### The moons
For the full [[Natan\|Natan]] myth about Mishim, see [[Tsa\|Tsa]].
Many Rosharan cultures personify the three moons as semi-divine beings. In [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], they are known as the Three Sisters, with Salas being the First Sister, Nomon the Second Sister, and Mishim the Third Sister. In [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]], Nomon is considered to be male.
A particular myth from Natanatan concerns the latter two moons and the local queen, [[Tsa\|Tsa]]. In the story, Mishim (characterized as young and impulsive) wishes to experience human pleasures, and attempts to persuade Tsa to swap places with her. Tsa eventually relents, agreeing to take Mishim's place for one night. However, Mishim fails to return before dawn, and fears that Tsa will tell her older siblings about the ruse. The following night, she attempts to go back, only to find out that Tsa enjoys her time in the night sky too much to switch back. While Mishim manages to convince Tsa to return, nine months later the queen gives birth to a blue-skinned child. Mishim realizes that she's been conned, and Tsa wanted to visit the night sky all along, as she wished to lay with Nomon.
The legend serves as an explanation for the Natan people's unusual skin tone.
