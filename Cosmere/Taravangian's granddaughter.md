## History
Following a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] in 1174 Taravangian's granddaughter, along with her nursemaids and several palace servants, became trapped after a rockslide cut off the entrance to the room they were in inside the [[Conclave\|Conclave]]. The young girl was rescued by [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] after [[Taravangian\|King Taravangian]] enlisted the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] princess to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] the rock that was blocking the doorway to the room.
Following the incident, the young girl recovered well, though she developed a tendency to avoid the narrower passages in the Conclave.
Later during the year, she was gifted a portrait of the king by her grandfather, drawn by [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]].

## Relationships
### Taravangian
In the hopes that he could witness Jasnah using her Soulcaster, Taravangian deliberately had his granddaughter trapped via a cave-in following the highstorm. Despite his ulterior motives, he was concerned for his granddaughter's wellbeing and did not want her to be harmed, even though he put her in a dangerous situation.

## Trivia
[[Ruli\|Ruli]] is a different grandchild to the one who Taravangian has trapped by the rockfall.
It is unknown if this grandchild is a sibling or cousin of Taravangian's other grandchildren.
