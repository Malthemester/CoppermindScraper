**Tinalar** is an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] who lived on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
Tinalar possessed a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], but no [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. Considering the young [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] to be merely a well-dressed fop, Tinalar dueled him for Shards, hoping to embarrass Adolin's father, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], and win Adolin's Plate. However, Adolin won the duel and claimed Tinalar's Shardblade as his own. Tinalar's Blade is the same one that Adolin later came to know as [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]].
