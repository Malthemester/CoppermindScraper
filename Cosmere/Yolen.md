**Yolen** is a planet in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] where the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]] happened. It's the homeworld of all the original [[Vessel\|Vessels]], along with [[Hoid\|Hoid]] and [[Frost\|Frost]]. The inhabitants of Yolen are called the Yolish.
Yolen is the setting of the unpublished novels *The Liar of Partinel*, *The Lightweaver of Rens* and *Dragonsteel Prime*. *Dragonsteel* proper, the prequel to the cosmere as a whole, will be set there.

## Geography and Ecology
Very little is known about Yolish geography, other than that it has some unusual features. Its gravity and other measurements are considered the **cosmere standard** by [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]-aware scholars like [[Khriss\|Khriss]]. Its ecology is divided into two distinct parts. Parts of it are similar to post-[[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], with similar flora and fauna. These parts are called **trune**. Other parts are coverd in **fainlife**, a poorly-understood, parasitic ecosystem hostile to humans. Although fain has the shape of ordinary flora, the plants and land overtaken by it are bone-white, and spill red liquid when crushed or snapped. There is something similar to a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] on Yolen, despite the lack of a Shard.
Yolen is home to three sapient races: humans, [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragons]] and [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]]. By [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] year 1174, [[Frost\|Frost]] is the only known inhabitant, and though there are more people living there, the Yolish population is rather small. While not all humans originated from Yolen, it was the first world on which they've appeared. Many languages currently in use across the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] are derived from Yolish ones.

## History
Yolen is one of the oldest inhabited worlds in the cosmere, and the first on which humans have appeared. It's also the homeworld of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], the entity believed to be the cosmere's creator deity. At some point, fain either appeared or traveled there, and began spreading, overtaking the original landscape. After some time, the original inhabitants learned how to deal with it and keep it back.
At some point, sixteen Yolish people, not all of whom were human, came together to kill Adonalsium for various reasons. The [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]], as it came to be known, dramatically altered the entire cosmere. All [[Investiture\|Investiture]] that once belonged to Adonalsium was divided between the [[Shard\|Shards]] created by its death, and the preexisting magic systems were altered in how they functioned.
Following the Shattering, most Shards left Yolen to go their own separate ways. Many humans have also abandoned it, spreading across the cosmere. Over the following millennia, it has become hidden in some way, shrouded from prying eyes, making reaching and researching it extremely difficult. By the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] on Roshar, its remaining population is very small, although the fain ecosystem seems to be doing just fine.

## Magic
Yolen appears to have several magic systems, though only two are known.

### Lightweaving
For more information, see [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]].
Lightweaving is cosmere's original illusion magic. It's capable of creating auditory and visual manifestations, either independent or attached to a host. It can produce disguises, as well as alter the appearance of other substances, like smoke. It's most similar to the [[Surge\|Surge]] of [[Illumination\|Illumination]] from [[Roshar\|Roshar]], albeit less restrictive, not requiring a [[Spren\|spren]] bond. Hoid learned this original form of Lightweaving on Yolen.
The Shattering appears to have changed something in Lightweaving, as the original magic is only semi-functional.

### Microkinesis
For more information, see [[Microkinesis\|Microkinesis]].
Prior to the Shattering, Yolen was host to some form of magic related to the manipulation of atomic particles, known as **axi**. The power allows its users to observe atoms and interact with them directly, although they are incapable of creating nuclear fission. Axi can also be used to refer to the smallest theoretical division of matter.

## Trivia
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] named Yolen after , who wrote *Dragon's Blood*, one of the early fantasy books he read.
The tree branch with writing on it from [[Mraize\|Mraize's]] collection comes from Yolen.
The [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], as well as the [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] plot and the character of [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]], were originally on Yolen. Brandon moved them to [[Roshar\|Roshar]] upon seeing concept art made by [[Ben McSweeney\|Ben McSweeney]] for *The Way of Kings*.
There is a saying on Yolen: "May two worlds become one to you." This is not referring to [[Realms\|Realms]].
While gods existed and died on Yolen prior to the Shattering, these gods were not Shards.
