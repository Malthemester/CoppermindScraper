>“*Flight Command, a bomber is heading toward the shipyard. It’s carrying a lifebuster.*”
\-Cloak reporting back to Admiral Ironsides[1]


Callsign **Cloak** is a scout from Ranger flight in the [[DDF\|DDF]]. She is the seventh member of her flight and flies a [[Val-class\|Val-class]] reconnaissance ship, which is designed for scanner avoidance and speed, rather than firepower.

## History
Cloak, along with [[Underscore\|Underscore]], joined [[Skyward\|Skyward]] flight under the command of [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] in the battle where [[Hurl\|Hurl]] died. Cloak and Underscore were ordered by Jorgen to identify enemy ships and relay the information back to Flight Command.
Later, in the [[Second Battle of Alta\|battle for the second falling shipyard]], Cloak reported the number of [[Varvax\|Krell]] ships to Admiral [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]], as well as confirmed that a [[Lifebuster\|lifebuster]] had also been sent by the enemy. On Ironsides order, Cloak -- along with the rest of the DDF scouts -- drove the lifebuster away from the shipyard, and it changed its course to instead head towards [[Alta\|Alta]], moving faster than expected. With the other pilots occupied, Ironsides ordered Cloak and the scouts to engage with the lifebuster and its defense ships. The scouts successfully managed to destroy the lifebuster, however, in doing so, the bomb it had been carrying was dropped onto the surface of [[Detritus\|Detritus]], killing Cloak along with eight other scouts.
