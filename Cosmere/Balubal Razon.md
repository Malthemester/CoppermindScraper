He went to the University of Maine and received a PhD in physics, without honors. He invented a camera that could take pictures of the past. He convinced [[Azari Laboratories\|Azari Laboratories]] to fund the development of a prototype. After eighteen months, he finally developed a working prototype, which he promptly stole.
He took the camera to Israel to fulfill his goal: learning the truth about Christianity and the resurrection. He was kidnapped by [[Salic\|Salic]], a member of the terrorist organization , who wanted to use the device to disprove Christianity, thus destabilizing the region.
