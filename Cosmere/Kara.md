## Appearance and Personality
Kara stood out among the scribes even prior to joining Bridge Four, as [[Lyn\|Lyn]] was familiar with her. She seems to fit in well with the other Windrunners, displaying a sense of humor in her relationship with [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Kara is surprisingly skilled with a spear. She has practiced with one since childhood, although she kept this ability secret when she was employed as a scribe.
She becomes a squire to an unknown Windrunner in Bridge Four at some point after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. She proves to be a quick learner and becomes one of the more proficient Windrunner squires. Even as a squire, her skill with both the spear and the Surge of Gravitation allow her to hold her own in battles with the [[Heavenly Ones\|Heavenly Ones]]. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] remarks that she is ready to advance to the [[Immortal Words\|Third Ideal]], but no [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] partners are available. It is unclear if an honorspren later becomes available for her to bond.
As a trained scribe, she is able to write in the [[Women's script\|women's script]] and use a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]. She takes her own notes during scouting missions.

## History
Little is known of Lyn's history. Since she served as a scribe for [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] forces under [[Teshav Khal\|Teshav Khal]] she is likely [[Alethi\|Alethi]], but this is not confirmed.
During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Teshav's scribe station was used as a field command post. The forces of the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] were stretched thin and every available soldier was needed. Lyn confided in Rock and [[Renarin\|Renarin]] that Kara was willing and able to fight since she had been training with a spear from a young age, facetiously referring to her childhood practice as "cheating".
Kara soon became a Windrunner squire and was one of the many squires present during the evacuation mission to [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on the *Fourth Bridge* in 1175. She was one of the few squires who were allowed to directly duel the [[Fused\|Fused]] and was seen scoring a hit on one of them with her spear. She engaged in some banter with Rock after Bridge Four returned to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
She also participated in scouting missions to [[Singer\|singer]]-occupied Alethkar, taking notes on the general condition of cities and their inhabitants as well as singer troop placements. Notably, she reported on the city of [[Tomat\|Tomat]] where [[Hesina\|Hesina's]] father lived.

## Trivia
Many Bridge Four members are cameos of Brandon's friends, and she may be a cameo of [[Kara Stewart\|Kara Stewart]].
