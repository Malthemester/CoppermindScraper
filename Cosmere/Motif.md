## Appearance and Personality
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], Motif usually appears as patterns on a spherical ornament at the end of a hairspike in [[Ishnah\|Ishnah's]] braids. He is smaller than [[Pattern\|Pattern]]. In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], he has the typical Cryptic appearance of a tall humanoid with stiff robes and changing symbols for a head.
He does not speak [[Alethi\|Alethi]] very well and prefers the Cryptic language. His personality is similar to other Cryptics; he does not seem to have a good grasp of human behavior or mannerisms, and he becomes extremely excited by lies.

## Attributes and Abilities
Motif can form a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with a human, giving him increased sapience in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. The bonded partner gains the [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] powers of the [[Order of Lightweavers\|Order of Lightweavers]]. He can also be used as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].

## History
Motif presumably bonded Ishnah at some point after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]; Ishnah was one of the first members of the [[Unseen Court\|Unseen Court]]. By around Vev 1175, Ishnah had spoken truths that allowed her to manifest Motif as a Shardblade. Motif and his fellow Cryptics all used the name "Pattern" before grudgingly selecting different names for themselves to help the humans identify them.
Ishnah and Motif were selected by Shallan as members of the diplomatic mission to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] sent by the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. During the journey through the Cognitive Realm, Motif was usually seen with his fellow Cryptics [[Mosaic\|Mosaic]], [[Ornament\|Ornament]], and Pattern. Their unusual behavior sometimes unnerved their human companions.
