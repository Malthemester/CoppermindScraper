**Ridger** is a member of the [[Idris\|Idrian]] royal family on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. As the second born child of King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]], Ridger was trained to one day become king, as his elder sister was betrothed to become the queen of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].

## Appearance and Personality
Ridger has a kind heart, always trying to do what was right. He had a good relationship with his youngest sister, [[Siri\|Siri]]. Before Ridger had to begin his training to become king, he and Siri often got into trouble.

## History
As second born child, he was set to inherit the throne because the eldest child, [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]], was betrothed to [[Susebron\|Susebron]], the God King of Hallandren. As a child he spent a lot of time with his sister Siri getting into trouble. Once he grew older and began to take on more responsibility, Ridger spent the majority of his time focusing on his studies and being groomed to rule. When King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] chose not to send Vivenna to Hallandren, [[Fafen\|Fafen]] believed Vivenna would inherit the throne instead of Ridger, which Vivenna thought would upset the order of things even more.
