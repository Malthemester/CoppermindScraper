**Jaador** is a nation on the continent of [[Opelon\|Opelon]] (Sycla) on [[Sel\|Sel]]. It is a land-locked nation that borders [[JinDo\|JinDo]] to the west, [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] to the north, [[Hraggen\|Hraggen]] and [[Hrovell\|Hrovell]] to the east, and a large desert to the south. A notable city named [[Kjaard\|Kjaard]] lies on a river near the border with Fjorden. Although Jaador's residents are ethnically [[JinDo\|JinDo]], the nation has been annexed by the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]] and the official religion is therefore [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]].

## Culture
Since Jaador's residents are ethnically JinDo, they presumably share the dark brown skin and fine features of JinDo residents. Jaadorians are known for their food, and Jaadorian chefs are considered some of the best in the world. Jaador also exports candy and wine of a blue color.
Jaador is the birthplace of a graceful light sword called a [[Jedaver\|jedaver]], known as a syre or kmeer in other nations. The jedaver proved impractical for combat, and was often used by the nobility for dueling. It was later modified in [[Duladel\|Duladel]] for use as a fencing weapon, and Jaadorians are considered to be second only to Dulas in fencing skill.

## History
JinDo is noted as being subsumed by the Fjordell Empire around one hundred years before the events of *Elantris*, but it is not known when Jaador fell. Fjorden appears to have heavy fortifications along its border with Jaador. The Fjorden [[Gyorn\|gyorn]] [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] claims that Jaadorian citizens would be among those that would form a massive Fjordell army at [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth's]] command, although he knows that this is unlikely due to the power of the Derethi monasteries.

## Investiture
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

[[Sel\|Sel]] has a "multitude" of magic systems that are powered by [[Investiture\|Investiture]] from the [[Dor\|Dor]]. These magic systems (such as [[AonDor\|AonDor]] and [[Forgery\|Forgery]]) are dependent on physical location, along with heritage and birth location. Although Jaador's origins are unknown, the fact that its residents are ethnically JinDo and the proximity of the two nations may hint that some Jaadorians would be able to use the power of [[ChayShan\|ChayShan]].

## Trivia
Early editions of *Elantris* included maps that showed Jaador in a slightly different orientation on the continent; these maps were superseded by revised versions in the tenth anniversary edition.
