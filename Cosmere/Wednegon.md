King **Wednegon** was a leader during the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] period of conquest after his [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension]]. He ruled at least a place named [[Darrelnai\|Darrelnai]], though that may have been the name of his kingdom. He was one of the last leaders after the Ascension that was able to resist the Lord Ruler in combat. [[Tindwyl\|Tindwyl]] and the [[Keeper\|Keepers]] had a biography of King Wednegon. Wednegon referred to the Lord Ruler as the Conqueror.
Wednegon's soldiers couldn't stand against the Lord Ruler's [[Koloss\|koloss]], and suffered a big loss at [[FellSpire\|FellSpire]] that they could not recover from. Wednegon did not blame his soldiers, instead blaming lack of food from the [[Deepness\|Deepness]]. Even though the Deepness had been defeated with the Ascension, its touch weakened [[Darrelnai\|Darrelnai's]] food supply. Wednegon's biographer seems to agree that their lack of food did lead to their demise. It is not clear how long Wednegon's forces survived after the Ascension, but if the Deepness affected their food supply so much, it must not have been very long after the Ascension.
