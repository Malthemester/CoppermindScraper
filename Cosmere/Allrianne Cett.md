## Appearance and Personality
Allrianne is described as youthful and cute. She has golden hair that is long and bouncy, owing to both her Western roots and her continued use of Final Empire styles. She is graceful like most noblewomen, but she also drops her dignified air to express high energy. She is first seen in a red dress after the current styles popular with the nobility, and is rarely seen out of such clothing.  While in Urteau, she is forced to wear plain brown skaa dresses, but continues to wear fancy ones within the safety of the city's storage cavern. She is disgruntled about the restriction but follows the law. 
Allrianne is perceived by many as a young, naive girl. She uses this perception to manipulate others at the same amount and level as her romantic interest Breeze, as seen by Sazed and as a Rioter rather than a [[Soother\|Soother]]. She is confident and demanding in both Allomancy and personality. From the moment she arrives in Luthadel for the first time, she expects to be taken care of at the level of living she is used to. Vin witnesses her listing off favorite foods to servants and arranging a bath the moment she knows she will be staying. Despite this need for comfort, she is repeatedly willing to go outside her comfort zone in order to protect or help those she loves. Not only does she bring her father back to Luthadel in order to assist Breeze, she also travels to Urteau despite knowing the city's political climate and hatred for nobles. She was in the most immediate danger by going there as a full blooded noble.
While Allrianne admits that her father cares little about the [[Skaa\|skaa]], there are repeated mentions of Allrianne's own lack of indifference towards them. When she goes shopping with Vin, she admits that she knows Breeze is half-skaa. She feels pity for them, and more specifically for Vin, at the time, but still treats Vin as a friend. Later, when she witnesses Quellion's executions, she begins crying and riots the crowd's emotions. This is no passive grief. She, intentionally or not, almost begins a riot as a result of her hatred for what Quellion is doing. Her feelings come through in her very active interactions with those around her.
Breeze seems to have some compunctions about influencing people in his love life, but Allrianne has no such worries. Cett informs Elend in their meeting that he is certain Allrianne has seduced Breeze, rather than the other way around.  Vin witnesses her doing so when she spies on Breeze and Clubs, and later she muses on the difficulty of getting Breeze to love her. Even when thinking about the seduction, she has no worries about its morality or the truth of their relationship, only finding it to have been a fun challenge. 

## Attributes and Abilities
Allrianne is a very skilled [[Rioter\|Rioter]], and is able to influence hundreds of people at once. She can easily manipulate people to help her or act the way Though it is unclear whether her seduction of Breeze was a result of that, or just her natural charm.
She also rides with an easy mastery, capable of staying on the back of a galloping horse even in a frivolous dress.

## History
 by  Ana Mateos 
Allrianne grew up in [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]] distanced from court, but was taught the customs by her mother. She was likely prepared to be married off to create a beneficial alliance. She was the first Allomancer to be born in the Cett family for centuries.
When Breeze went to the Western Dominance, Allrianne seduced him by Rioting him to be attracted to her. After Breeze convinced Ashweather Cett that the atium cache was in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], Allrianne went with Cett's army, and entered the city alone, during the [[Siege of Luthadel\|siege]], to both seek asylum and to find Breeze.
[[Tindwyl\|Tindwyl]] selected Allrianne to accompany Vin in a shopping trip for dresses because she knew the fashions of the time. Allrianne attempted to bond with Vin during the carrige ride there, but is largely ignored by Vin. She ended up attracting [[Spook\|Spook's]] attention, which turned out to be fleeting and was better kept by a crowd that gathered to see Vin.
Allrianne left Luthadel with [[Elend\|Elend]], Vin, and [[Spook\|Spook]] on the pretense of going to find the Well of Ascension, after being prompted by Breeze, so that she would survive. Allrianne left the group after they passed [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture's]] army to persuade Cett to help the Luthadel army.
Allrianne encounters a group of bandits, the leader of which is [[Hobart\|Hobart]] and promised them a reward to guide her to her father's camp. Allrianne convinced Cett to turn around and head back towards Luthadel to gain something off of their arduous trip and to help Breeze.
Allrianne was not able to get her father to help Elend's forces, but when the Koloss and Elend's forces attacked Straff's, Allrianne was able to convince Cett to aid Elend's army.
Allrianne was in a relationship with Breeze during [[The Hero of Ages\|The Hero of Ages]]. Allrianne and Breeze, along with Captain [[Goradel\|Goradel]] and Sazed, went to Urteau, where they found Spook, to officially act as ambassadors while retrieving supplies from the cache and to help quell a rebellion. Allrianne was in the storage cavern when the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]] occurred and Allrianne was transported to the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] with [[Ham\|Ham]] and [[Demoux\|Demoux]] when Sazed changed the world.
During the founding of [[Elendel\|Elendel]] and the time after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]], Allrianne gave speeches on workplace equality and feminist themes, which codified a culture in which women are expected to be able to remain feminine while working. Allrianne was referred to as one of the [[Originators\|Originators]].

## Relationships
She cares very much about Breeze, enough to ride out and convince her father to turn back and help [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], and therefore Breeze, survive.
