>“*She'll throw you in a heartbeat and you'll break your crown, bridgeman. She's not good with riders*”
\-Jenet to Kaladin[1]


**Dreamstorm** is a young, high-sprited horse under [[Jenet\|Jenet's]] care in Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
In 1173, Jenet was in the process of getting Dreamstorm used to wearing a saddle when [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] came for their first riding lesson. She was kept tied up off by herself, separated from the other horses. When [[Adolin\|Adolin]] saw that [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was riding the more docile [[Spray\|Spray]], he suggested trying Dreamstorm if Kaladin wanted a horse with more spunk.
Despite Jenet's warnings that Dreamstorm was not good with riders, Kaladin chose to try riding Dreamstorm anyway. He Lashed himself to her saddle with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and managed to hold on through Dreamstorm's first round of attempts to throw him. Dreamstorm was clever enough to wait briefly until Kaladin's guard was down and the Stormlight had run out before she finally bucked him off.
At the end of this incident, Dalinar advised Kaladin not to take Dreamstorm out on patrols.

## Appearance and Personality
Dreamstorm is a strong, large, and lean horse. As younger horse, she still is rather wild and spirited. Most recently Dreamstorm is kept picketed by herself so she can run for short bursts in a circle. Dreamstorm wears a saddle even not when being ridden to help her grow accustomed to it. She is unwilling to accept any rider. Dreamstorm does her best to buck off anyone that even tries to mount her.
