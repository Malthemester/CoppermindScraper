 by  Randy Vargas  Sliding along the ground with [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]]
### Surgebinding
Godeke is an Edgedancer and as such has access to the surges of Abrasion and Progression.

## History
Godeke used to be an ardent before his bond was formed and he joined the [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] forces in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. He states he used to be "deformed" all his life, and his [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] allowed him to heal and become as he has always seen himself. His reference to [[The Book of Endless Pages\|The Book of Endless Pages]] could possibly indicate he belonged to the [[Devotary of Sincerity\|Devotary of Sincerity]]. His bonded a [[Cultivationspren\|Cultivationspren]] named [[Archinal\|Archinal]], who presents in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] as a short woman in robes, made entirely of vines and crystal. He claims to have had some experience in matters of diplomacy. He speaks [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] as well as [[Alethi\|Alethi]].

### The Evacuation of Hearthstone
Godeke was one of the Edgedancers brought with the *Fourth Bridge* to help evacuate the civilians and heal the battling Radiants in [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. He was guiding a group of refuges to the airship when [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] flew by closely being followed by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. The shardblade of the edgedance almost hit her but only sliced her robes.
Later, he went with [[Roshone\|Roshone]] to the manor to help free the people trapped in the burning building. In the manor he was taken hostage by a fused who took him out to use as bait. When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] entered the building, he found Godeke injured severely by a [[Fused\|Fused]] who slashed his stomach, and the new Surge-cancelling fabrial in effect, prevented the Edgedancer from healing with his Stormlight. After Kaladin fought the present Fused and singers and disabled the device, he ordered [[Lift\|Lift]] to evacuate the slowly-healing Godeke.

### Mission to Shadesmar
Godeke is part of a group of Edgedancers attending one of the meetings of the coalition. A proposal was brought up to send an envoy to the honorspren to persuade them to bond more radiants. When Dalinar suggested sending an Edgedancer, Lift volunteered first. The rulers were not comfortable with that, and when Dalinar suggested they send someone with practice as a diplomat, Godeke spoke up that he could try and had some experience with these kind of things. He would be joined by Adolin, Shallan, a Truthwatcher and Stoneward.
The expedition was gathering near the Oathgate platform. When approaching, Godeke noticed Adolin packing his horse and asked him how many swords he needed. The highprince replied you could never have too many and proceeded to show of his collection. Godeke quickly extracted himself from the exchange and hurried along. The group went to shadesmar and started hiking down from the Oathgate to sea level. At some point, Adolin came walking beside Godeke, who expressed wonder at all the works of the Almighty they could now see. The former ardent thanked the highprince for taking him on the expedition. They proceeded to talk about Vorinism and how Godeke believed Honor was just an aspect of the Almighty, and as such the Almighty could not die. When Dalinar came up he called him a *holy* man, and so it was fine for him to write. Godeke compared Dalinar's vibrant transformation to his own smaller transformation when his deformity was healed.
When after sailing for weeks they finally sighted land, Godeke was eager to leave the ship. The lightweavers went ahead to scout, while Godeke and Adolin discussed how the stormlight in even their biggest gems had started to fade. The highprince asked Godeke to take their last stormlight into town and trade it for supplies. After going into the town, Godeke came searching for Adolin to get him to look at a group of humans. Together they went to check them out. They found a caravan of what appeared to be Tukari. They tried to talk to them in various languages, with Godeke speaking Thaylen. The caravan responded in a hostile way, and the edgedancer concluded they were Tukari indeed.
Later the Radiants and their spren discussed how to approach the honorspren. Godeke agreed with [[Arshqqam\|the Stump]] that trying to guilt them into helping would not work, nor would threats. The group could not come up with a better alternative. Later Godeke was scouting ahead with his spren, he had practiced during his Radiant training. After a break, Adolin suddenly realized the Tukari were not following the expedition, but Notum the honorspren. The highprince ran to the rescue and Godeke and the others marched after him as fast as they could. After Adolin's fight, Godeke inspected the prince's side wound and bound it, as they had no stormlight left to heal with. Before they left, the edgedancer went among the fallen and memorized their faces. When the group reached [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]], Godeke joined the others in objecting to Adolin's plan to stand trial.
After Adolin's capture in Lasting Integrity, Godeke camped near the city with [[Felt\|Felt]] and [[Malli\|Malli]] to await the results, while the rest of the expedition had gone back to tell Dalinar what had happened. The Edgedancer had been allowed into the city just to heal Adolin. The communicated via letters, and informed Adolin when Notum had returned to patrolling.
