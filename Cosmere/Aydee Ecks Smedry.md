She also displays something of a mischievous streak.

## Attributes and Abilities
Aydee has the Talent of being really bad at math, which changes reality to match her perception of how many things she thinks there are of whatever she is adding.
Later, Alcatraz uses her Talent to increase the number of  grenades they have in their arsenal. Though she knows that the equation he gives to tell her how many bears they have is fake, she feigns ignorance so that her Talent will work.
Aydee is also a capable pilot, like her sister Australia.
