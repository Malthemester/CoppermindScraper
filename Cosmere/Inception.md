**Inception** is the testing and induction ceremony which creates [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatists]].
Inception is a religious ceremony of the [[Church of the Monarch\|Church of the Monarch]] and takes place in a Monarchical chapel. On the Fourth of July every year, all the 8-year-olds in the fifty isles are "incepted". Holy water is sprinkled on their heads, and they are blessed and told to enter the chamber of inception. A [[Shadowblaze\|Shadowblaze]] is bound to a small and seemingly random portion of the children that go through the Room of Inception, making them [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatists]]. [[Joel Saxon\|Joel Saxon]] is one of the very few to have been incepted well after his inception age, as his previous inception was done incorrectly.
