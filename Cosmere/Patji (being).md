**Patji** is an avatar of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] related to the planet [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]] in the [[Drominad system\|Drominad system]].

## History
At some point Patji was a being of its own, with unknown amounts and origins of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], somehow related to the [[Shard\|Shard]] Autonomy. Autonomy was not always aware of Patji's existence, but at some point sensed it and was consciously and directly involved in shaping it into an avatar. The relationship between a Shard and avatars is poorly understood, but Patji remains strongly connected to Autonomy.
Patji has close ties to the planet First of the Sun, and presumably lends its name to the island of [[Patji (island)\|Patji]], the [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] known as [[Patji's Eye\|Patji's Eye]], and [[Patji's Finger\|Patji's Finger]] trees. The humans who live on First of the Sun pray to Patji and sometimes refer to it as "Father", although they also personify other islands. Patji is not thought to permanently "reside" on First of the Sun, but the concept of residence is blurry for beings that reside in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]].

### Letter to Hoid
Patji was the author of a notable letter to [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. In the letter, Patji referred to itself using plural pronouns such as "we" and "us" and mentioned an "avatar of our being", implying that in some ways it was speaking for Autonomy as a collective. The letter established a previously existing relationship with Hoid and discussed the fact that he had approached an unknown avatar with a plea for help. Patji seemed impressed that Hoid was even able to find the avatar in question, as it was thought to be well hidden, but it was unable to respond to him and would not have been receptive to his pleas anyway. Patji went on to say that it was not concerned about [[Rayse\|Rayse]] and wanted to be left alone. It also instructed Hoid to stay away from [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]] and the young avatar located there. The letter included several sea-related metaphors and mentioned that Hoid would need to visit their waters and overcome a set of unknown tests in order to gain their respect and reopen the discussion.
