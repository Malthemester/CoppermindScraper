**Red Young** is a bounty hunter from the [[Fortress Town\|forts]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].

## Appearance and Personality
Red wears fine clothing typical of fortfolk, including a hat, and he carries a knife and a cudgel. He rides a horse while in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]]. He seems to have a smug attitude, and [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]] mentions his fake-looking grin. He becomes disfigured with a milky eye and blackened face after an encounter with a [[Shade\|Shade]].

## History
Red mentioned that he had been tracking [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]] for four months. He and and his group of seven other bounty hunters from the forts pursued Silence and [[William Ann Montane\|William Ann Montane]] while they were hunting Chesterton, hoping to collect the bounty on his head. A scout in Red's group named Tobias found the pair after they had killed Chesterton, and Red and his team soon approached them, armed for a fight. To avoid a confrontation, Silence allowed Red's gang to take the corpse; she assumed that [[Theopolis\|Theopolis]] had tipped them off to her location.
Silence then pursued Red's gang and set a trap with [[Silence's grandmother\|her grandmother's]] firestarter, hoping to get the corpse back. [[Shade\|Shades]] were drawn to the fire and killed the bounty hunters; Red escaped with his life, although he was touched by the Shades and became disfigured. Red then intercepted Silence and William Ann, took the latter hostage, and demanded the corpse. Before Red could leave, he was hit in the shoulder with a padded crossbow bolt, causing his knife to draw blood from William Ann, enraging the nearby Shades. Silence later realized that Theopolis had been watching the situation and was the source of the bolt; he had hoped that the Shades would kill everyone present, leaving the corpse for him. As Red attempted his escape, he shoved William Ann through a Shade, then ran. He had picked up Silence's [[Silver\|silver]] dagger and tried to fight off the Shades, but they were far too numerous and quickly killed him.
