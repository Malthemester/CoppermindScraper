**Lerasium** is a [[God Metal\|God Metal]]. A normal person burning lerasium becomes a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] of undiluted power. A Misting or Mistborn burning lerasium drastically increases their powers. [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] can use lerasium to store an unknown quality, and when used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, lerasium steals all abilities.
Lerasium is notable as it is the condensed power of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. The only known source were beads found at the Well of Ascension. Presumably, the name "lerasium" is inherited from [[Leras\|Leras]], the name of the original holder of the Shard Preservation, just as the name [[Atium\|atium]] is inherited from [[Ati\|Ati]], the original holder of the Shard [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. Lerasium cannot be combined with atium to make [[Harmonium\|harmonium]], nor can harmonium be broken down into lerasium and atium. While it would not be possible to get lerasium and atium from harmonium through distillation or other mundane methods, through some supernatural means it may be achievable.

## Allomantic Use
For normal people, burning lerasium forges a permanent [[Connection\|Connection]] between them and Preservation, turning them into very powerful Mistborn by rewriting their [[Spiritweb\|spiritual DNA]]. For people who are already Mistborn, the same effect increases their power. However, turning people into Mistborn is only a side effect of burning lerasium; if someone who knew how to use it correctly were to burn it, it would have a different, as of yet unknown, effect. Someone knowledgeable enough could use the rewrite of their spiritual DNA to achieve a different result than becoming a Mistborn. Burning [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] in conjunction with lerasium does not have any effect on the strength of the Mistborn created, but the size of the bead does affect the strength of the Mistborn created.
Alloys of lerasium have the side effect of turning those who burn them into [[Misting\|Mistings]] of the alloy used. Alloys of lerasium and other God Metals can make those who burn them gain the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] associated with the God Metal. The primary effects of lerasium alloys are also unknown.

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of lerasium needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, they would Ascend and become the holder of Preservation, similar to what happened when [[Vin\|Vin]] consumed the [[Mists\|mists]]. This is due to the nature of the metal as the condensed power of Preservation.

## Feruchemical Use
Lerasium, when used by a Feruchemist, has unknown properties.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, lerasium steals all abilities, such as strength, senses, or mental acuity. This wastes most of its potential.

## History
Lerasium was created by Leras. Rashek collected the beads, after taking the power of Preservation at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], and used them to entice foreign kings to become his allies. He left two beads near the Well, for reasons unknown.
However, neither of these beads were used prior to the fall of the Final Empire. One bead was fed to Elend to save his life after being attacked by [[Leras\|Leras]], whose hand was directed by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], in an attempt to prevent [[Vin\|Vin]] from releasing Ruin from the Well. The other was stolen and consumed by [[Hoid\|Hoid]], after he used the Well to transition from the Cognitive Realm to the Physical.

## Trivia
If [[Harmony\|Harmony]] wanted to, he could produce more lerasium.
