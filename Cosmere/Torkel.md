**Torkel** is a [[Dayside\|Daysider]] from [[Taldain\|Taldain]] and a former advisor to Lord Merchant [[Vey\|Vey]].

## History
Torkel worked as an advisor to Vey, a powerful member of the [[Taishin\|Taishin]]. Torkel and his family went missing in a boating accident about a year before the arrest of [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]] and were presumed dead. The accident had a high profile, as both [[Ais\|Ais]] and one of her [[Trackt\|trackts]] remembered Torkel's name.
Ais and some other trackts discovered Torkel alive in a hidden closet after they apprehended [[Lokmlen\|Lokmlen]] in [[Kezare\|Kezare]]. The corpses of his family members were also found in the closet, and Torkel was suicidal and in very poor health. He told Ais that he and his family were imprisoned by Sharezan after he tried to back out of a secret deal, likely related to his access to Vey.
