## Appearance and Personality

## History
Vlxim claims to have previously sailed through a highstorm.
For many months, Vlxim was part of a crew trained under captain [[Drlwan\|Drlwan]] to sail the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail]], owned by merchant [[Vstim\|Vstim]]. When Vstim retires, the ship is inherited by Vstim's apprentice, [[Rysn Ftori\|Rysn Ftori]], who assumes commands of it and its crew.
In a [[Expedition to Akinah\|mission]] led by the new shipowner, Vlxim sails to [[Akinah\|Akinah]] as part of the crew of the *Wandersail*. Vlxim is the helmsman of the ship when it penetrates through the terrible storm around the island, and he successfully brings the ship safely to the other side. When the ship approaches their mythical destination, Vlxim and the ship's captain, [[Drlwan\|Drlwan]], were the first to stare at the distant island in awe.
