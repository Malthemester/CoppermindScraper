An **Essence Mark** is a particular type of [[Soulstamp\|soulstamp]] that is designed to [[Forgery\|Forge]] a person's memories, history, and soul for a brief period of time. Essence Marks are among the most powerful and most complex soulstamps a Forger can create. In [[Realmatic\|realmatic]] terms, an Essence Mark reforges the spiritual aspect of an individual to match the new history.
Essence Marks are considered blasphemy by a number of cultures, including the [[Grand\|Grands]] of the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]], the [[Mulla'dil\|Mulla'dil]] Strikers, and the [[Dzhamar\|Dzhamarians]].

## Construction & Use
Essence Marks are the most difficult type of soulstamps to create, typically requiring years worth of development and construction, and are required to be attuned to a specific individual in order to function. When a human is soulstamped, the transformation lasts a relatively short period of time, and the best crafted stamps last approximately a day. This is due to the fact that the identity of a person, as opposed to an object, is constantly growing, changing and shifting. It may also be due to the fact that all humans are naturally invested with a small amount of investiture, and investiture resists change by other investiture.
To create an Essence Mark, one must make hundreds of stamps, each one representing a small portion of the history or personality which you would wish to change. These stamps must be tested individually to make sure that each will take, and then networked together into a lattice on some external object. The lattice will be connected to the final stamp, which will act as a keystone for the other stamps, and will be the only one necessary to stamp. The lattice must maintain in contact with the skin of an individual to maintain its effects. A deep knowledge of the individual and the new history you wish to write is necessary to create the stamps for an Essence Mark. An Augur would find their Allomantic powers "useful" for making Essence Marks for themselves.
