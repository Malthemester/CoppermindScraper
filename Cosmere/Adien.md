## Appearance and Personality
 by  botanicaxu  With his siblings
Adien is from [[Kae\|Kae]], born autistic. Throughout his childhood, Adien moves in an awkward, stiff, uncontrolled manner. He constantly mumbles numbers (e.g., distances to landmarks in steps) and words (e.g., "Elantris") to himself. Adien has a natural way with numbers, instinctively knowing the distance in strides between any two locations.

## History
In his early teens, five years before Raoden heals Elantris, Adien is taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. Unwilling to have him thrown into [[Elantris (city)\|the city]], his family conceals his condition with makeup and keeps him close to home. The makeup gives Adien a pale white complexion with a strange cast to his face. Because of his new condition, Adien spends much of his time sleeping. With his family's help, Adien accomplishes the unprecedented feat of staving off becoming [[Hoed\|Hoed]] for those five years.
When Sarene meets him, Adien is a thin-faced boy in his late teens. After [[Raoden\|Raoden]] heals Elantris, Adien gives him the exact distance to [[Teod\|Teod]] so that Raoden can effectively use Aon Tia to rescue Sarene.


## Trivia
Adien is the planned protagonist in the [[Elantris sequel\|Elantris sequel]]. It is also expected that [[Hrathen's seon\|Hrathen's seon]] will be passed to Adien in the sequel.
Brandon plans on writing Adien in Elantris 2 differently with his greater understanding of autism, and how to properly write such characters. As he understands how he displayed it in a very stereotypical and pop-culture based way, and wants to improve it.
