## History
Restares became the leader of the Sons of Honor, it is unknown if they founded the group himself or took charge of it later. They had Gavilar Kholin enter the group and this allowed him to later help expand the their influence further on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]] were primarily founded so as to ensure the return of the [[Herald\|Heralds]] by restarting the [[True Desolation\| Desolations]], Restares and Gavilar Kholin had additional plans for the group and used it to further these goals. Upon learning of Gavilars plans Restares responded favorably to them and they began to conspire together, meetings were held where they would meet in person with their final one taking place on the night Gavilar was to die. Upon his death Restares was one of the people Gavilar suspected of ordering his assassination, in actuality however Restares did no such thing.
After Gavilar's death Restares continued to lead the Sons of Honor and replaced Gavilar with Amaram as their main partner. The majority of their communication took place through [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]. After conferring together following the attempted assassination of Amaram by [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]], it was decided to take the Shards that [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] had won and murder any witnesses to this crime. During this time Amaram was ordered to investigate the mysteries of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and upon seeing how far he had progessed [[Mraize\|Mraize]] feared that he was close to achieving this goal. Following the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Amaram wrote to Restares via spanreed that the Sons of Honor were successful in their goal of bringing the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] back to Roshar, with the hopes the [[Herald\|Heralds]] would also return as well as informing them about the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].
Following the year after the [[Battle of Thaylen Fields\|Battle of Thaylen Fields]] the leadership of the Sons of Honor began being targeted and assassinated by the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]]. Once Mraize was satisfied that their leadership were eliminated he handed a new mission to [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to hunt down Restares personally in [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]].

## Motives
Restares motives are ultimately unknown, it has been stated that they have goals beyond simply restarting the Desolations however what those goals are have never been said, it is known that whatever these goals were they were happy to also help Gavilar achieve his own and vice versa. Their goals also run contrary to the Ghostbloods and Mraizes hence their antagonism towards them.

## Relationships
### Gavilar Kholin
Restares and Gavilar both were close partners in managing the Sons of Honor while he remained alive. Together they began sharing their secretive plans with one another and helping the other to achieve them as well as having meetings about their plans in private, this meant that unlike many in the organisation Gavilar was allowed to learn Restares identity. Despite this friendly nature however Restares was still one of the people Gavilar suspected would have attempted to kill him perhaps implying a tension between the two.

### The Ghostbloods
The Sons of Honor and the Ghostbloods are hostile to each other with the Ghostbloods attempting to assassinate the Sons of Honor leadership numerous times. Their leader [[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar]] was also the first person Gavilar suspected of ordering his death. After Mraize believed the Sons of Honor destroyed he ordered Shallan Davar to go on and assassinate Restares, as well as this he showed a personal deep dislike and hatred aimed towards them.

### The Skybreakers
The relationship between the Skybreakers and Restares is complicated to decipher, it is notable that one of their members attempted to assassinate Amaram however Mraize himself was confused as to why exactly they would do such a thing and suggested one of their members may have simply gone rogue. Besides this strike there is no evidence of the two groups attacking each other and no skybreaker has ever shown interest in killing Restares.

## Trivia
Restares at some stage became aware of the [[Cosmere\|Cosmere]] and has some knowledge on it, although to what extent is unknown.
