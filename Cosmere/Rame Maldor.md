>“*The Higgens effect is old news! I’m much more interested in the way that a static electric field produces similar results. Why, you should see the work we are near to completing!*”
\-Wayne, disguised as Hanlanaze trying to confuse Maldor[1]


**Rame Maldor** is a scholar and patron of [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]]. He's a tall man and wears too much plaid.
He introduced himself to Professor [[Hanlanaze\|Hanlanaze]] at the party, not realising that it was actually [[Wayne\|Wayne]]. He had studied and written about the "Higgens effect", and Wayne confounded him by suggesting that it meant nothing compared to electrical fields. Rame has previously corresponded with Hanlanaze and planned to study electrical fields himself. He was put off when Wayne, as Hanlanaze, suggested that Rame was behind in the scientific race and that Hanlanaze had purposely withheld his study of electrical fields to get ahead.
