The **Sea of Fjorden** is a body of water on [[Sel\|Sel]]. It is named for [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]], the largest country on the continent of [[Opelon\|Opelon]] (or Sycla).

## Geography
The sea lies between Opelon and the northern continent that contains [[Teod\|Teod]]. It takes about five days to travel across the sea from Teod to [[Kae\|Kae]]. A number of small islands dot the sea between Arelon and Teod and also near [[Svorden\|Svorden]]. Arelon, Svorden and Fjorden all have long coastlines on the sea.

## History and Use
The Teos originally crossed the sea from the area around [[Arelon\|Arelon]] to colonize their peninsula. Teod was long thought to have the region's most powerful military armada, although the Fjordell Empire's annexation of [[Svorden\|Svorden]] and its navy significantly bolstered its fleets.
The sea is used for both transportation and mercantile activities. [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], [[Teoras\|Teoras]], and [[Widor\|Widor]] are all port cities. The water is saline and smells of brine and sea life, and a food fish known as [[Trike\|trike]] is plentiful. Merchant fleets are common, including those owned by King [[Iadon\|Iadon]] and Duke [[Telrii\|Telrii]], despite attacks from pirates such as [[Dreok Crushthroat\|Dreok Crushthroat]].
