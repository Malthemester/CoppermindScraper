## Relationships
### Jorgen
>“*To be honest, during my practices -- before I started official training -- I thought a pair of wings might let me escape his legacy. But I’m not defiant. I’ll do what’s expected of me.*”
\-Jorgen telling Spensa of his father[6]


Algernon and Jorgen have a strained relationship, with Algernon having a large amount of control over Jorgen's life and future career. Algernon expects his son to follow in his footsteps and join the NAL as a politician, creating an avenue for Algernon to more easily interface with the DDF. Algernon specifically requests for Jorgen to be placed into [[Cobb\|Cobb's]] class to ensure the safety of his son.
Algernon sends his son to flight school so that Jorgen can gain the privileges and respect awarded to pilots, as this will be beneficial when Jorgen transitions into the political sphere. According to Jorgen, his parents had planned for him to spend six months as a full pilot before claiming some sort of family emergency that would create an avenue for Jorgen to switch careers.
Before joining flight school, Jorgen hoped that he could get out of his father's shadow by becoming a pilot, however, he has come to accept the ties that bind him. Algernon has always worried how much his son enjoys flying, likely seeing it as a potential threat to the life plan he has created for his son.
