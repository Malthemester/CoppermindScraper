## Appearance
Sunraiser is a long sword with a thin blade and a large crossguard. Running down its sides are the ten fundamental [[Glyph\|glyphs]], representing the ten orders of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Though hefty, it's light enough to be held in one hand even by a person without [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. However, it's more suited to two-handed wielding, and has a particularly long  that lends itself to half-swording.

## History
Like all dead Shardblades, Sunraiser was once a [[Spren\|spren]] that became stuck in its current form at the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Its fate afterwards is mostly unknown, but by the time of [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholins']] conquest of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], it found its way into the hands of Highlord [[Kalanor\|Kalanor]]. Dalinar defeated Kalanor and gifted the Blade to Gavilar, insisting that the latter save it for his children.
Eventually, [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] came to carry the weapon. During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], it was one of the two King's Blades, alongside Gavilar's [[Firestorm\|Firestorm]], and all non-Shardbearer [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] could borrow it for duels and training. Later, early on in the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Elhokar took it with him to the besieged [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. As Elhokar died there, it's likely that Sunraiser was found and picked up by one of the [[Fused\|Fused]] or their servants.
During the occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], [[Navani\|Navani]] saw a [[Singer\|singer]] wielding Sunraiser try, and fail, to use the Blade to damage the [[Sibling\|Sibling's]] shield. Navani confronted [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]], asking that her son's Blade not be flaunted before her. Raboniel told her that she had not known that it was Elhokar's Blade and said that she had not intended to taunt Navani with it.

## Trivia
Sunraiser is one of three named Shardblades so far to have gotten a canonical depiction in the books, alongside [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]] and [[Firestorm\|Firestorm]].
Brandon deliberately wanted Sunraiser's design to be traditional and simple compared to other Shardblades.
While it is significant that there are ten Radiant glyphs etched into it, Sunraiser was not a [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] Shardblade.
