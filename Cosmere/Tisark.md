The **Tisark** seems to be a group of [[Odium\|Odium's]] people sent to secure the [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
As Renarin sees a group of [[Fused\|Fused]] holding the Oathgate, it is possible that this is the name for a group of the Fused.
