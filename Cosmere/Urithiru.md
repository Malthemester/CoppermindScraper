>‚Äú*Urithiru was said to be the center of the Silver Kingdoms, a city that held ten thrones, one for each king. It was the most majestic, most amazing, most important city in all the world.*‚Äù
\-Jasnah's opinion of Urithiru[1]


**Urithiru** is a tower-city on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that functioned as the home of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] and the central point of the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]]. In the present day, it serves as the headquarters of the forces opposing [[Odium\|Odium]], including the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]], the refounded Knights Radiant, and the remaining [[Alethi\|Alethi]] soldiers and nobility. The current [[Jasnah Kholin\|queen]] of Alethkar rules from the tower, though [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] have been recognized as the king and queen of Urithiru. The city serves as the physical manifestation of the [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren the [[Sibling\|Sibling]].

## Location
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] Urithiru on the map of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]
>‚Äú*Though many wished Urithiru to be built in Alethela, it was obvious that it could not be. And so it was that we asked for it to be placed westward, in the place nearest to Honor.*‚Äù
\-The Vavibrar, line 1804[4]


Urithiru is located almost exactly in the middle of the Rosharan continent, in the [[Mountains of Ur\|mountains of Ur]]. It lies in the range's western part, on the border of [[Emul\|Emul]] and [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]]. The tower sits on the east side of one of those mountains, leaning against two slopes.
The plateau on which the tower is located is at a considerable altitude. The air is thin enough to make physical activity difficult. The cliffs beneath it extend further than the eye can see. This location is high enough that both [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] and the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] pass beneath it, which makes it difficult for the tower's current occupants to obtain [[Stormlight\|stormlight]].
Historically, there was some disagreement as to whether or not Urithiru is accessible by means other than [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] travel or flight. Ancient chroniclers Varala and Sinbian both stated that it was impossible, but in [[Nohadon\|Nohadon's]] eighth parable from [[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]], he claims that he walked from [[Abamabar\|Abamabar]] to Urithiru (which he confirms in Dalinar's dream, saying that he did not use an Oathgate, only a guide, which he believes wasn't "cheating" in any way). As is later revealed, there is an entrance at the bottom of the mountain which can be used to exit the tower on foot.
There is an unnamed village in the foothills of the mountain to the south of the tower, but it is apparently not visible from the tower, as all Dalinar can see is clouds and rocks. In addition, Urithiru sits relatively close to the [[Valley\|Valley]] of the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]].

## Appearance
>‚Äú*There were no clouds here to bring the darkness. This place was above them all. Urithiru ruled even the clouds.*‚Äù
\-Szeth musing on the tower[14]


 by  Jacobo Montoya  Front view of the tower
Urithiru is as wide as a city and as tall as a small mountain. It consists of 10 semi-circular levels, with each level being 18 stories tall, for a total of 180 floors. At approximately fifteen feet per story, the tower stands just over 2700 feet tall. Going down, each level is wider than the one above it, with the roofs of the wider levels having fields and gardens built on them. There are numerous balconies on the sides of the tower. The bottom level has wide sections jutting out at the perimeter, each the size of a plateau. These areas have grooves, which in the past were furrows for growing crops, and planter boxes around the edges. In front of the tower is a massive plaza surrounded by the ten [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] platforms.
The lower levels "meld" into the mountain on either side, but the center and the upper levels have a flat side on the stormward side. Rooms in this flat side have windows facing the [[Origin\|Origin]]. The glass windows miraculously survived thousands of years of abandonment utterly intact.
The center column of Urithiru is one solid window, also facing the Origin. This column has a footprint the size of a ballroom and is full of dozens of lifts, which look like the exterior balconies and crawl up and down vertical channels in the walls using Stormlight. Large beams that support the center column (e.g. "Northbeam") seem to be rather prominent and used as landmarks when navigating the tower.
Because the tower is high enough to be above most highstorms, long chains with cages exist to lower gemstones down to renew Stormlight.
The interior of Urithiru is filled with tunnels that twist about in strange curves, which Dalinar hypothesizes was done to fool invaders. Navani's scholars have also found oddly shaped groups of rooms and murals of fanciful animals (including some that might be lions, though those do not exist on Roshar), along with gold and copper metals embedded in the walls, presumably fabrials that they have been unable to understand.
The tower is composed of multiple rooms of different functionality, including sleeping quarters, meeting halls, libraries and bathhouses. Most of them have high ceilings.

### Strata
 by  Ben McSweeney  A cross-section of Urithiru, showcasing the atrium
Each tunnel in Urithiru has distinctive patterns of strata. Known strata colors include shades of brown, yellow, red, orange, and emerald green, though it would appear that only [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] are capable of perceiving the various colours. The stone itself is smooth to the touch and hard enough that it can't be scratched with a knife. Notably, the same strata patterns can be seen on the [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] windblades, indicating similar (perhaps shared) origin.
Shallan theorizes that the strata might be veins, though she's unsure of what they would be carrying.
Known strata descriptions:

**Third floor corridor where Sadeas's body is found**: "twisted with lines‚Äînatural strata of alternating earthy colors, like those made by crem drying in layers."
**Bathhouse where Vedekar Perel's body is found**: "spiraled, twisting around the floor, ceiling, and walls like the threads of a screw"; "curving, twisting medley of oranges, reds, and browns‚Äîballooning out across the sides of this chamber in wide bands before coiling back into narrow stripes to continue down the hall that led out the other side"
**On the way to Dalinar's quarters**: "wide reddish strata alternating with smaller yellow ones"; "sloping slightly upward"
**Shallan's quarters**: "bright circular patterns"
**Room where Dalinar inspects the Honorblade**: "no strata"
**Sparring room**: "grey and black"
**Sadeas' quarters, side room**: "muted pattern of strata"; "oranges and reds that blended together so evenly you could almost pretend the wall was all one hue"
**Passageway to the theater**: "emerald cast"
**Small chamber where Dalinar and Navani worked**: "like the folds of a fan"
**While Shallan chased the Midnight Mother**: "danced on the walls"
**Storage room near the top of the tower**: "a line of red crystal embedded in the stone wall [...] started at the ceiling and wound all the way down the wall--within the pattern of the light green and grey strata--to the floor. It was smooth to the touch, distinct in texture from the rock around it [...] like the other strata lines ripple out from this one, getting wider as they move away from it"
### Notable locations

 by  Marie Seeberger  The Breakaway
The Breakaway is a large, cavernous hall as large as a small town within Urithiru's walls. While its previous function is unknown, after the [[Alethkar\|Alethi]] arrive at the tower, it becomes their central market area, with stalls, food stands, and taverns. Many of the establishments are tents or simply roped-off areas, but an increasing number of permanent structures are being built there. Merchants from all ten highprincedoms mingle here and all kinds of goods can be purchased, including illicit ones like firemoss. The atmosphere is chaotic, busy, and varied. The Breakaway has a large, round well at its center, which, like all wells at Urithiru, never seems to run out of water no matter how much is taken from it. It is unclear where the water comes from.


The Ten Rings is a section of the Breakaway that was planned by [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]]. The streets are neat and orderly, with quaint wooden buildings that include both shops and living quarters. Merchants who agree to Navani's oversight receive reduced taxes and frequent guard patrols. The area lacks high-end shops due to wealthier [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] refusing to give Navani control, but it also lacks seedier establishments due to the presence of law enforcement. [[Adolin\|Adolin]] frequents a winehouse named [[Jez's Duty\|Jez's Duty]] in the Ten Rings area.


The Oathgate platforms of Urithiru are arranged in a circle on the grand plateau in front of the tower. The platforms are 10 feet high, with ramps leading up to them. The small control buildings in the center of each platform have mosaics on the floor showing Dawnchant glyphs. In each control room, the keyhole is at the center of a ten-pointed star on a metal plate. At the present, the plateau in front of the Oathgates is used for storing lumber and training soldiers.


A room resembling a theater can be found on the tower's third level, near the Breakaway. It's a large chamber with round walls and rows of stone benches facing a raised platform that served as a stage. This stage can be reached both by stairs from the audience and by a separate entrance. The corridor leading to it is narrow enough to be touched on both sides, and goes by several smaller chambers, possibly dressing rooms. Past the theater's back door (the one which would be, presumably, used by the audience), there is a circular room with large vertical slits in the walls, some of which face Breakaway, although neither it, nor the theater itself can be reached directly from the market. It is there that [[Shallan\|Shallan]] puts on a Lightwoven play of [[The Girl Who Looked Up\|The Girl Who Looked Up]] for [[Pattern\|Pattern]], and where they first encounter [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]].


For more information, see [[Urithiru gem archive\|Urithiru gem archive]].
 by  Petar Penev  [[Shallan\|Shallan]] fighting [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] in her chamber
The chamber in which the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] hides until being banished by [[Shallan\|Shallan]] can be reached from the tower's ground floor, from a room where a large pit with a stone spiral staircase leads down several stories. Rust marks on the wall indicate that part of the stone once served as a secret door, though the hinges have long since decayed and Shallan has to cut her way in with a [[Shardblade\|shardblade]].
At the bottom of the staircase, a large archway of individually-placed stones ‚Äî unusual in Urithiru ‚Äî leads to a hallway, the ceiling of which has a large mosaic of the [[Herald\|heralds]]. The walls are also covered in mosaics, depicting the ten [[Spren\|spren]] of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], with the three Bondsmith spren being depicted as a single type. There is also other imagery: the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] as a cloud, a woman in the shape of a tree reaching with her hands toward the heavens, and a figure hovering above the ground embracing a blue disc, representing, respectively, [[Honor\|Honor]], [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] and a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]]. Beneath the murals, two metal doors on opposite sides of the hall lead to two decayed libraries.
Navani's scholars catalog and remove the debris, turning the area into a meeting hall for those working on uncovering the city's mysteries. Henceforth, it's there that the assemblies concerning the city's functionality and [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] are held. As is later discovered, the tiles on the walls are actually drawers, holding the [[Urithiru gem archive\|Urithiru gem archive]].
At the end of the hallway is a bowl-shaped room. At its center stands a twenty-foot-tall column of gemstones, around which Re-Shephir coiled when discovered. The column is composed of thousands of gemstones of all ten types melted together. This appears to be the core for all the fabrials in the tower, as [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] was able to corrupt the Sibling using it.
On the far side of the room, a tunnel with carved stone steps leads even further below the tower. The passage runs through a long string of caverns, eventually leading to an exit in the foothills of the [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]] mountains. Re-Shephir uses this path to flee Urithiru after her confrontation with Shallan.


The platform atop Urithiru is the smallest floor of the whole tower. It is open-air, allowing the viewer to observe their entire surroundings. It appears to be [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] favorite spot in the tower to think, and has seen its fair share of notable events related to him, such as him swearing his First and Second Ideals as a [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] and marrying [[Navani\|Navani]].


The Gallery of Maps is located near the top of the tower. From the moment the Alethi arrive in the city, it is used as their main meeting room, both for discussing strategy and when speaking with foreign dignitaries. Though it is initially barren, a table is brought in at some point, which Shallan and Dalinar use to create a real-time map of Roshar. It's named after a similar chamber back in the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]].


The Cloudwalk is a garden balcony, an open stone pathway with a railing, set up around the base of Urithiru's eighth tier. During the year or so after the reclaiming of Urithiru during the True Desolation, this balcony, with its stunning view over the mountains, becomes a popular location for people of any nation and rank to meet and relax.

## Mechanisms
For more information, see Sibling#Urithiru.
Urithiru displays a number of unusual properties that allow humans to survive despite its high altitude. It is believed that these systems are somehow powered by or related to the spren known as the [[Sibling\|Sibling]]. However, at some point the Sibling withdrew from mankind to remain in slumber within the tower, but was later awakened by Raboniel. During the invasion of the tower in 1175, the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] bonds with Navani Kholin, making all fabrials of the Tower operational.
Fabrial systems that functioned before the awakening of the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] include those for increased pressure temperature, and general conditions encouraging plant growth. Navani also theorizes that the air circulating through various shafts is powered by some sort of fabrial. In addition, the [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] elevators connecting Urithiru's floors begin running when gemstones are inserted. The gems in the [[Urithiru gem archive\|gem archive]] which preserve recordings of human voices might also be considered fabrials.
Newly functioning fabrials include the plumbing and sewage systems. Taravangian theorizes that fabrial lights were used to increase plant growth and crop yields to make the tower self-sustaining.
In a storage chamber near the top of the tower, the walls have veins of garnet, the gemstone classically associated with blood. Due to their connection to the tower, [[Navani\|Navani]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], and [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]] were able to communicate with the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] and with one another through the [[Sibling\|Sibling]]. Navani notes that the records in the gem archive ‚Äúspeak of this tower like a living thing. With a heart of emerald and ruby, and now these veins of garnet. These veins connect at the tower's lower levels, where the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] previously slept.

## History
### Pre-Recreance
Urithiru was constructed at some point early on during the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era. Initially, many wished for it to be constructed in [[Alethela\|Alethela]]; however, it was eventually built elsewhere, in a place considered to be "closest to Honor". It's unclear whether it was created by [[Herald\|Heralds]], [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] or [[Shard\|Shards]] themselves, but it was beyond the capability of Radiants to create.
Though it's unclear whether it was originally built for this purpose, Urithiru was the headquarters of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] orders, as well as the center of the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]], holding ten thrones, one for each king. Even following the temporary end of the cycle of [[Desolation\|Desolations]], it remained an important location as both the home of the Radiants and the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] hub. During that time, Urithiru had a large population of not only Radiants, but also ordinary people - servants, traders, craftsmen and so on. At one point, the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] invaded the tower, and was trapped and sealed by an unknown [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]].
Eventually, the systems that allowed people to inhabit Urithiru - most importantly, raising its temperature to allow people to live comfortably and grow foods - began to fail as the Sibling withdrew from managing Urithiru after feeling betrayed by Melishi and the Radiants, and after the capture of Ba-Ado-Mishram. This forced the Knights Radiant to abandon the tower, leaving behind only the [[Urithiru gem archive\|gem archive]] where they coded their last messages.
Between this and the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]], the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] in the 9 surviving cities were sealed, leaving Urithiru locked away from the world.

 by  Elisgardor 
### Era of Solitude
Some time after the tower was abandoned, [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] broke out of her confinement, but remained within the tower.
Though Urithiru had faded into myth by the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], [[Szeth\|Szeth]] was familiar with it, and would visit it often after becoming a [[Truthless\|Truthless]]. He had gone by the village at the bottom of the tower's mountain so many times that he mused that at some point, they had started thinking of him as some sort of god, leaving out tributes of [[Sphere\|spheres]] for him to use for [[Stormlight\|stormlight]].
[[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] began an effort to rediscover the city after growing convinced that a new Desolation was coming. While she herself was unable to do so, her student, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], managed to complete her works and pinpoint the location of [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]], an ancient city that possessed an [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], but was destroyed long before Urithiru was abandoned. She eventually lead the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] army to Stormseat--now a [[Listener\|listener]] city called [[Narak\|Narak]]--and, as the listeners summoned the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], transported them through its Oathgate, rediscovering Urithiru.

### True Desolation
Following the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], Urithiru became the center of military power for the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]], led by Dalinar and the Alethi. Most [[Highprince\|highprinces]], chief among them [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]], relocated there along with their armies. The Alethi began to reinhabit the tower, even dividing it into sections that they called "princedoms". However, they were unable to reactivate most of Urithiru's systems, such as the heating or the main elevator. Following a string of strange accidents, [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] was tracked down and banished from the tower by a team led by [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] Several [[Oathgates\|Oathgates]]--those of [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], [[Azimir\|Azimir]] and [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]--were unlocked to reenable fast transportation across the continent.
As a prelude to the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] attacked Urithiru through the subverted [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] Oathgate. Although initially somewhat successful, they were eventually pushed back and out of the city.

## Culture
>‚Äú*Most scholars consider it just a myth. The ardents refuse to speak of it, due to its association with the Radiants, and therefore with the first major failure of Vorinism.*‚Äù
\-Jasnah[1]


Though massively important in the past, prior to the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] Urithiru was all but unknown to [[Vorinism\|Vorins]] who didn't study the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], with Shallan being unfamiliar even with its name. This could be the result of the [[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]] working to suppress all knowledge of Radiants, similar to how they discredited [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].
In contrast, [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] is familiar with Urithiru, at least insofar as the traditions surrounding it are concerned. According to the Shin, the stones in Urithiru are unhallowed, making them fine to walk on, as opposed to the rest of non-soil-covered Roshar. [[Szeth\|Szeth]] also has no problem recognizing Urithiru for what it is, and made it one of his first destinations after becoming [[Truthless\|Truthless]], suggesting that the Shin - or at least their leaders - had known its location all along.

### Economy
Back before the tower was abandoned, the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] would extract payment for the use of [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]]. Shortly before the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], the tariffs began to increase to the degree that some of their contemporaries found unreasonable. After the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] arrive at Urithiru, Dalinar designates [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]] as [[Highprince of Commerce\|Highprince of Commerce]] there. As has been done before, Sebarial plans to tax passage through the [[Oathgates\|Oathgates]] in order to provide revenue for the tower city, as it produces little else.
Most trade in Urithiru takes place at the Breakaway. Though [[Navani\|Navani]] had plans for a carefully regulated market, Sebarial has instituted looser controls, resulting in a chaotic marketplace with several black markets and room for illicit goods.


 by  Marie Seeberger  Scholars exploring Urithiru
The tower city's economy suffers from three main difficulties: a lack of labor, a lack of supplies, and a lack of infrastructure.
Following the healing of all [[Parshmen\|parshmen]] during the first [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], the Alethi have suffered from the loss of their menial labor class that carried over as they relocated to Urithiru. To alleviate that, [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] of low [[Nahn\|nahn]], as well as soldiers and caravan workers, have been pressed into service doing tasks such as hauling water, to their dismay. In an effort to reduce labor tensions, Adolin encourages these men to form a water haulers' guild to bargain for wages. The lack of parshmen will no doubt result in increased consumer costs as slavery is replaced by paid labor, the wages of which are based on social rank and not very negotiable.
Since Urithiru's crop growing system is non-functional, the city depends on trade to provide supplies. At first, goods flowing into Urithiru through the Oathgates are mostly salvage from the warcamps abandoned during the flight from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], harvested by enterprising merchants backed by the [[Highprince\|highprinces]]. Dalinar has considered trying to resettle the war camps, but the area has been quietly claimed by those highprinces who stayed behind. Though Sebarial has forests near the camps that could be used to supply the city, harvesting the lumber isn't economical without parshmen. Emeralds for [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] food are also in short supply, despite continued hunting for [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Later, after King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] joins the alliance, regular shipments begin to come from [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. Still, there is not enough trade to support the city, leading [[Bethab\|Bethab]] to speculate that without a deal with [[Azir\|Azir]], Urithiru may not be able to support its current population.
Urithiru's non-functional mechanisms have left it with a lack of infrastructure. Waste management has been a particularly notable issue. Communal privies have been set up over former bathing rooms, but these are plagued with long lines. The plumbing of Urithiru keeps clogging, and Soulcasters are constantly working to eliminate the waste. Additionally, at this altitude, heating is a constant problem without magical enhancements.
Another minor issue affecting Urithiru's early economy is the lack of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to infuse [[Spheres\|spheres]]. The need for Stormlight to power the Oathgates means that in the period immediately following Urithiru's discovery, when the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] disappeared, infused spheres were worth considerably more than face value. After the highstorms return, spheres can be re-infused by lowering them in large cages down into the storm.

## Politics
Because Urithiru is rediscovered at the advent of the first [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], it becomes the immediate refuge and then the de facto home of most of the nation of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. The Alethi, who have been at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to pursue the fulfillment of the [[Vengeance Pact\|Vengeance Pact]], largely move away from their warcamps and populate the tower after its discovery. The nation of Alethkar is subsequently taken by the Fused, and efforts to defend the capital city, [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], are unsuccessful. This means that King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], and later Queen [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], rules from Urithiru over the population that has resettled in the tower.
Elhokar's original desire is to swear allegiance to Dalinar as his highking. He means to retain his position as king of Alethkar but to cede authority to Dalinar when it comes to matters concerning Urithiru or the Shattered Plains. The proposal is drafted and sealed, but its publishing is postponed until those at Urithiru receive word of Elhokar again after his disappearance in Kholinar. This unwittingly gives [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] fodder for his efforts to undermine the stability of the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]], and he reveals his knowledge of the matter at a meeting just prior to the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. When the Kholins finally receive confirmation of Elhokar's death, Dalinar declares that he cannot be king of Alethkar; he sees the need to separate himself from having power in his old land and instead to focus on the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] and on leading the coalition. Jasnah is raised up as queen of Alethkar instead. The coalition officially recognizes [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] as the rulers of Urithiru during the year following the battle in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] in exchange for an official renouncement of any claims to be a highking.

## Trivia
 by User: Jofwu A comparison of scale between Urithiru and large structures on earth.
The stones of Urithiru being unhallowed is part of [[Shinovar\|Shin]] culture rather than something magical.
Brandon has confirmed that Urithiru is not a spaceship used to travel from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] to Roshar.
In similar vein, Brandon has stated that the [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] windblades are not powered by Urithiru.
