## Excerpts
>“*The spren betrayed us, it's often felt.Our minds are too close to their realmThat gives us our forms, but more is thenDemanded by the smartest spren,We can't provide what the humans lend,Though broth are we, their meat is men.*”
\-9th stanza[1]

>“*But it is not impossible to blendTheir Surges to ours in the end.It has been promised and it can come.Or do we understand the sum?We questioned not if they can have us then,But if we dare to have them again.*”
\-10th stanza[2]
