**House Cett** is a noble house on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. Despite its nobility, House Cett is unable to produce any [[Allomancy\|Mistborns]], and only a few [[Misting\|Mistings]]. Before the death of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], House Cett had very little power. After the death of the Lord Ruler, they attempt to siege [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] under Lord (temporarily king) Ashweather Cett. Although they are classified as noble, House Cett has a long history of skaa interbreeding, and as a result [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]] is the only Cett Allomancer in centuries. During the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]], Cett, his family and his servants take up residence in [[Keep Hasting\|Keep Hasting]]. Their small army of 200 soldiers and [[Hazekiller\|hazekillers]] is attacked and destroyed one night by [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Zane\|Zane]], in an attempt to try to confirm Vin's suspicion that Ashweather is secretly a Mistborn.
Members include [[Ashweather\|Ashweather]], his children [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]] and [[Gneorndin Cett\|Gneorndin]], and their descendants, Lady [[Aving Cett\|Aving]] and Lord [[Westweather Cett\|Westweather]].
