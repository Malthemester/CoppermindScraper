### Epic Weakness
If any duplicate came within earshot of a *Weaponized Cupcake* song they would lose molecular cohesion, their flesh literally melting from their bones. If enough duplicates hear it, they all disintegrate.

## History
### Before Calamity
Before the arrival of [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]], Lawrence was a member of the band *Weaponized Cupcake*. He was the only one in the band who was classically trained, a fact that infuriated him. He was aggravated by the fact that the lead guitarist kept playing the same chord progression over and over.

### Newcago
Mitosis journeyed to Newcago to learn the truth surrounding Steelheart's death. He did not believe that [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]], an average non-Epic, was capable of killing a High Epic of Steelheart's power. He also wished to rule Newcago, stating that he was more powerful than Steelheart because Steelheart needed men to help administrate while he himself was an army of one. He snuck into Newcago and started duplicating himself, each copy armed with a handgun. He threatened civilians to draw David out, then chased David through the city. David eventually figured out that Mitosis’ weakness was hearing songs by his old band, and started singing even as he was cornered. [[Tia\|Tia]] sent a message via mobile to the citizens of Newcago, who came outside and started singing one of Weaponized Cupcake’s old songs, ultimately killing Mitosis for good. After his death, Mitosis’ DNA was sold to [[Dean Knighthawk\|Knighthawl]] and later obtained by [[Jax (Reckoners)\|Jax]].
