## Appearance & Personality
In his unembodied form, Rabies is completely invisible to the living. To other poltergeists he appears as a glowing field seeping over surfaces. When in possession of a living body, he looks and sounds like the person he is possessing, including their accent and some of their mannerisms. In this state he can be recognized by other poltergeists as one of their kind due to a bright yellow-colored glow visible around his form.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a poltergeist, Rabies must possess the body of a living person in order to maintain consciousness. When possessing a body, he gains full control over the person and can even access certain skills for a limited time. If the body he is possessing is killed, he is forcefully ejected and becomes a mindless, primal unembodied spirit, desperate for warmth until he finds and takes over a new body. He can also [[Bolting\|Bolt]] from one body to another if he makes physical contact with the new body.

## History
Rabies met fellow poltergeists [[Dreamer (character)\|Dreamer]], [[Phi\|Phi]], [[Icer\|Icer]], [[Longshot\|Longshot]], and [[TheGannon\|TheGannon]], who all love to play games. As a group, they got together often to play games by possessing the living and using their bodies disposably, as if they were players inhabiting the persona of a video game character.
During one such game, Rabies was playing cops and robbers in Manhattan against Phi, on a team with the other four poltergeists in their group. Rabies was assigned to hunt Phi on the streets with Dreamer and Icer. At some point in the game, Rabies' second body was killed by Phi, leaving him out of contact with the rest of the group. After Dreamer tackled Phi off the building where Longshot was hiding, Rabies managed to take Phi's next body into custody, winning the game for his team. After the game was over, he remarked on the chaos and damage that they had caused, and suggested that they leave.
