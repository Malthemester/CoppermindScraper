>“*He loved humankind. He died defending you.*”
\-The Stormfather on Tanavast[7]


In one of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] visions, he appeared as a tall muscular man with dark skin and pure white hair, wearing billowing trousers and a waist-length coat, both of which seemed to be made of gold. Dalinar considered this clothing strange, which may indicate that it was from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]—or it may simply be a reflection of how style had changed since Tanavast recorded the visions.
Little is known about Tanavast as a person, but the people who met him have an excellent opinion of him. He seems to be the only Vessel with whom [[Hoid\|Hoid]] has a good relationship, and is, aside from [[Ati\|Ati]], the only one Hoid ever praises, calling him a decent person. The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] insists that Tanavast did love mankind, even dying to defend them. Tanavast himself seems to have been highly dedicated to his role as a deity and protective of humanity, even apologizing in visions for getting himself killed.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a Vessel, Tanavast originally held as much power as his peers. At some point, however, he was weakened enough that, even with Cultivation's assistance, [[Odium\|Odium]] was able to kill him. Like other Vessels, he had Shardic future sight, though it was not as strong as that of [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]].

## History
 by  mushimallo 
### On Yolen
At some point in the past, likely prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], Tanavast met [[Hoid\|Hoid]], and left a good impression on him. Hoid mentioned that he regretted Tanavast's death, but would allow it to happen again if it could help him achieve his goal.
Tanavast was one of the sixteen people who shattered [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], after which he Ascended as the Shard of Honor.

### Early Roshar
After the Shattering, Tanavast and his lover, [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]], moved to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], and both Shards Invested equally in the planet.
To counter the [[Fused\|Fused]], he formed the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] with the ten [[Herald\|Heralds]], which bound the Fused to [[Braize\|Braize]] after death. The [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] is also part of what keeps [[Odium\|Odium]] captive on [[Braize\|Braize]] where he could not splinter other [[Shard\|Shards]].

### Silver Kingdoms Epoch
Sometime before the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]], he passed responsibility for creating new [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] to the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]]. When the last generation of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] discovered that humans were the invaders on Roshar, he did not support them as he had past Radiants, but instead raved about how they would destroy the world. Sometime after the Recreance, he recorded several visions for the Stormfather to show to [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] candidates, and was later killed by Odium when Honor was Splintered.
