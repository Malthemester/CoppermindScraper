This article is about the space station.¬†For the first Skyward Flight novella, see [[Sunreach\|Sunreach]].
**Sunreach** is a space station in the [[Cytoverse\|Cytoverse]].
The station is a research facility built by the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] to observe a [[Mammoth starpod\|mammoth starpod]]. By the time of [[Winzik\|Winzik's]] attack on [[Detritus\|Detritus]], the station was abandoned, though the mammoth starpod remained and its life support systems were still functional. The station is outfitted with a [[Hypercomm\|hypercomm]] and conventional radio. At least part of the station has concrete flooring, wooden doors, and tube lighting along the ceiling.
After fleeing Winzik's coup on [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]], Minister [[Cuna\|Cuna]] and a few other [[Dione\|diones]] were marooned at Sunreach and came under attack from Superiority forces, requiring them to be rescued by [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]]. During the rescue mission, the Superiority forces destroyed the station just as Cuna's party and Skyward Flight [[Hyperjump\|hyperjumped]] back to [[Platform Prime\|Platform Prime]].
