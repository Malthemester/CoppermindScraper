**NaiMeer** is a dockmaster in [[Lossand\|Lossand]] on the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. He is [[Vey\|Vey's]] nephew.

## Appearance
NaiMeer has light brown hair, which is cut short, and is clean shaven. He wears a blue tunic over olive slacks, a wide brown cloth belt, and tall brown boots. He wears the symbol of The Helm, a ship's wheel, on the breast of his tunic.

## History
When [[Kenton\|Kenton]] needs to travel to [[Lraezare\|Lraezare]] to find Vey, NaiMeer refuses to give him a ship, saying that his uncle, Vey, told him not to let Kenton sail. The [[Taishin\|Lord Admiral]], [[Delius\|Delius]], then arrives, interrupts their argument, and commandeers a ship for himself. Delius then invites Kenton and his party to join him on his trip to Lraezare to visit the [[Helm\|Shipowners' Circle]], foiling Vey's plan.
