**Tshadr** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and [[Highguard (Roshar)\|highguard]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. He is a wealthy man who owns a manor. He possesses a suit of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], and as such is a member of one of the eight Thaylen houses to own Shards.

## History
Tshadr likely received his Shardplate from his father in his youth, as was the tradition among Thaylen Shardbearers. By the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], he held a position in the highguard, protecting the Thaylen throne. During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Tshadr led a group of soldiers and held [[Court Square\|Court Square]] in the fight against [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] corrupted soldiers and [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen Rnamdi]], having not seen the man, assumed he was either in his manor or mustering troops in one of the upper tiers of the [[Thaylen City\|city]]. [[Hrdalm\|Hrdalm]] was able to relay news of Tshadr's location to [[Adolin\|Adolin]] at a later point in time.
Sometime after the battle in Thaylen City, Tshadr moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and settled in rooms on the fourth floor. He was the only non-[[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] Shardbearer in the tower when the [[Fused\|Fused]] conquered the tower. Someone, presumably [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], told the invaders which room he was in, and the [[Shanay-im\|shanay-im]] were able to kill him and take his Plate without anyone noticing.
