**Valtroux**, also referred to as **Valtroux City**, was a city in the [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Geography
It was at least two days riding to the north from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], and a three days' march from [[Holstep\|Holstep]] and the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]].

## History
After [[Yeden\|Yeden]] was put in charge of the [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebellion's]] small army, he commanded them to attack [[Holstep\|Holstep]], hoping that his men would gain some experience in a relatively easy fight. The skaa force numbered seven thousand, while Holstep's garrison only had about a thousand soldiers. About two thousand of the skaa (including [[Demoux\|Demoux]]) did not participate in the attack, believing that Yeden was acting rashly and would expose the army's position. Yeden and the other five thousand rebels defeated the Holstep Garrison, although the fight proved more difficult than Yeden had anticipated. During the battle, the Holstep Garrison managed to send a messenger to nearby Valtroux City. The Valtroux Garrison numbered five thousand, and it immediately marched to Holstep.
News of the Holstep battle reached [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], and [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and his crew learned of Yeden's foolhardy actions. Kelsier set out with [[Vin\|Vin]] to help the skaa, but by the time they arrived, the Valtroux Garrison had slaughtered the rebels. The Valtroux force was on order to take no prisoners, and put the heads of Yeden and several other officers on spears next to a road. The only survivors were Demoux's group, who had concealed themselves.
The skaa force was better prepared than other rebellions in the past and managed to put up a decent fight, but they were not yet ready to face a fully trained garrison of equal size, particularly since the battle with the Holstep Garrison had just concluded. The brutality of the Valtroux Garrison was presumably meant to quash the skaa rebellion, as the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] was aware of the situation and had massacred rebellious skaa in previous incidents such as [[Tougier\|Tougier]]. Kelsier blamed himself for the defeat, and believed that his own enthusiasm and the promise of help from [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]] were the source of Yeden's overconfidence.
Shortly after the battle, the [[Luthadel Garrison\|Luthadel Garrison]] arrived to relieve the Valtroux troops and continued to search for remaining skaa rebels who fled the battle.
