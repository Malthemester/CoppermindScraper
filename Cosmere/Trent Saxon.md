**Trent Saxon** was a chalkmaker employed by the [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatics]] department of [[Armedius Academy\|Armedius Academy]].
He is described as being "big and burly".
He took pride in his job as a chalkmaker, and he made chalk with special formulas for specific usages in Rithmatics.
Though not a Rithmatist, he is very interested in Rithmatic lines to a degree of obsession. He spends a lot of money to meet with professors of Rithmatics. He discovered a new kind of Rithmatic line, but didn't know its effects. Nobody knew it was a Rithmatic line until Joel recognized it in [[Harding\|the Scribbler's]] drawings.
He was killed in a springrail accident while investigating a new Rithmatic line.
