>“*It was hatred. A deep, pulsing hatred with a pressure to turn all things molten. It was the heat of a thousand suns, it was the bliss of every kiss, it was the lives of all men wrapped up in one, defined by everything they felt.*”
\-Dalinar describing Odium[2]


**Odium** is the [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] originally held by [[Rayse\|Rayse]]. Unlike most other Shards, which typically pick a single world and settle there, Odium has been traveling freely throughout the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] for a long time, deliberately refusing to [[Invest\|Invest]] himself anywhere. He is responsible for the deaths of at least four Shards -- [[Ambition\|Ambition]], [[Devotion\|Devotion]], [[Dominion\|Dominion]], and [[Honor\|Honor]]. In the present, he's confined to the planet [[Braize\|Braize]], but his influence can be felt on the entire [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]]. Odium’s [[Investiture\|Investiture]] is typically associated with “burning” gold or violet-black colors, though it is also often red, the color that signifies corrupted Investiture. His overall motif is red-gold, although gold is his "real" color.

## Intent
>“*They call me Odium. A good enough name. It does have a certain bite to it. But the word is too limiting to describe me, and you should know that it is not all I represent.*”
\-Rayse[2]


The Shard of Odium is even harder to control than [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. The word "odium" means hatred. However, interpretation of the Shard's intent is not as simple. [[Frost\|Frost]] claims a straightforward definition: that it is God's own divine hatred. Rayse himself, however, claims that he's Passion, a Shard of emotions, in particular excessive emotions. Upon Ascension, Taravangian grappled with the vicious urge to destroy and burn. Many of his [[Splinter\|splinters]], the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] compel people to give in to powerful sensations - [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]] compels people to revel mindlessly, and [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] inspires exultation in battle. On the other hand, the overwhelming amount of emotions inspired by Odium are hateful, among them the aforementioned [[Thrill\|Thrill]] and the Rhythms of Odium-derived [[Singer\|singer]] forms. Moreover, Odium's influence sometimes promotes apathy rather than passion, as his followers are encouraged to give up their pain and sense of guilt.

>“*He hates Honor. Well, I guess he hates everything. It’s kind of in the name....*”
\-Adolin to Shallan[18]

[[Rayse\|Rayse]] has a tendency towards self-deception, and apart from him, everyone understands Odium as being the Shard of hatred. While it's possible for a Vessel to influence a Shard to an extent, Odium's declaration of being Passion should not be taken at face value.
Apart from the issue of the Shard's nature, Rayse desired to become the sole god of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Whether this is due to the Vessel or the Shard is unknown.

## Associated Magics
### Voidlight
For more information, see [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]].
Voidlight is the gaseous form of Odium's [[Investiture\|Investiture]], analogous to [[Honor\|Honor's]] [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. Unlike Stormlight, however, Voidlight's applications are far more narrow. It can be utilized by the [[Fused\|Fused]] to provide healing and fuel their use of [[Surge\|Surges]], and it might have some relation to the forms of power used by the [[Regal\|Regals]]. It has applications in fabrial technology created via the process of corrupting spren and then trapping them within an appropriate gemstone housing, similar to normal fabrials.
A singer can sing the Song of Prayer to obtain Voidlight, though this would draw Odium's attention and appears to have certain limitations. In the past, it was also provided by [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]], and possibly through other means.
Voidlight can be combined with Stormlight via the use of the Rhythm of War, binding them into a form of light called "Warlight" that has a dark blue-white appearance.

### Raysium
For more information, see [[Raysium\|Raysium]].
Raysium is a [[God Metal\|God Metal]], a physical form of Odium's raw power. It is gold-white in color and its ability to conduct investiture has many applications in fabrial technology.

### Voidbinding
For more information, see [[Voidbinding\|Voidbinding]].
The [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] magic system associated with Odium is [[Voidbinding\|Voidbinding]]. Very little is known about it at the moment, including the specific powers it grants or the method of acquiring the ability to Voidbind. What is known is that there are ten levels to it, and that it involves something called the Voidbindings, which might be the name of individual powers, analogous to Surges. It is highly likely that predicting the future is one of those powers.

 by  Petar Penev  [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], an [[Unmade\|Unmade]] of Odium
### Spren
Despite his reservations about [[Invest\|Investing]] into a planet, Odium has created numerous [[Spren\|spren]] in the Rosharan system, known collectively as [[Voidspren\|Voidspren]]. Some of them are intelligent, and capable of autonomous thought despite not being bonded to a living creature, in contrast to most spren of [[Honor\|Honor]] or [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. Others are as mindless as ordinary emotion or nature spren. [[Singer\|Singers]] can bond the latter to become [[Regal\|Regals]], taking the spren into their [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] to gain forms with supernatural abilities ranging from speaking all languages, to summoning lightning.

For more information, see [[Unmade\|Unmade]].
Standing apart from regular voidspren are the Unmade, a group of nine great [[Splinter\|Splinters]] of Odium, each granted immense power. Their abilities vary from Unmade to Unmade--some are capable of influencing human minds, some can grant powers to other creatures, and others have the ability to change spren. Likewise, their levels of intelligence vary; while [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] is almost human-like, [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] behaves more like a blind force of nature or animal.

### Fused
For more information, see [[Fused\|Fused]].
Fused are [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]] of singers bound to Odium. This grants them numerous benefits, chief among them the ability of resurrection by taking over the bodies of their living kinsmen. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], this can occur when the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] passes over singers who have been mentally primed to let something into their [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]]. How this bonding happened before the Everstorm existed is unknown.
The Fused can use Voidlight to heal themselves, as well to fuel their use of [[Surge\|Surges]]. Unlike [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], the Fused have access to only one Surge each. Lady [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] claims that the Fused are more skilled with their Surge, however, due to Fused being more internally focused, while Radiants are more externally focused.

## History
For the history of Odium's original Vessel prior to his Ascension, see Rayse#History.
### Ancient History

Odium was created at the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], when the creator god, [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], was killed by sixteen people, splitting it into sixteen [[Shards\|Shards]]. One of those killers was [[Rayse\|Rayse]], who chose for himself the Shard of Odium.
At some point after Ascending, Odium went after one of his fellow Shards, [[Ambition\|Ambition]], as he felt most threatened by her intent. However, before he could find her, he located two other Shards, [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]], in the [[Selish system\|Selish system]]. Because they had settled together, Odium attacked them since he could argue that they were breaking the agreement the Vessels made about not being in the same system as another Shard. Through means unknown, Odium killed and [[Splinter\|Splintered]] them both. To prevent their remaining power from gaining intelligence of its own, he then pulled them out of the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] and into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]], creating the [[Dor\|Dor]] and causing [[Sel\|Sel's]] magic systems to become location-dependent. He wasn't very experienced at the time, and his countermeasure failed as the Dor did, indeed, begin to gain a measure of sentience.
After creating the Dor, Odium went on to the [[Threnodite system\|Threnodite system]], where he found and attacked his initial target, Ambition. During the fight, Ambition was dealt a grievous wound, and chunks of her power were flung across the system. Ambition managed to flee the system, but was still Splintered in a fight with Odium. The Shard [[Mercy\|Mercy]] was also involved in at least one battle with Ambition and Odium. These clashes resulted in a wound in the Spiritual Realm and had "disturbing" effects that "twisted" the planet [[Threnody\|Threnody]] and its inhabitants.
Although Odium was successful in these initial conflicts, he was weakened by them.


Next, Odium set out for [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]], seeking to kill either [[Honor\|Honor]], [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], or both. According to the Eile Stele, he was brought by the humans from another world, and the singers considered him a human god. It can be assumed that Odium was crucial in the breakdown of the relations between the two species. Eventually, for unknown reasons, a swap occurred, whereupon singers came to worship Odium while humans began serving Honor and Cultivation. Both sides created their own immortal armies - Odium, the [[Fused\|Fused]], and Honor, the [[Herald\|Heralds]].

>“*I am … I was … God. The one you call the Almighty, the creator of mankind. And now I am dead. Odium has killed me. I am sorry.*”
\-Tanavast[48]

Honor fought Odium with assistance from Cultivation, and the two bound him to one of the system's planets, [[Braize\|Braize]]. Honor additionally crafted the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], which would use the Heralds to imprison Odium's forces on Braize along with their master. However, Odium was a much better fighter, and [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]] was killed, though he inflicted a deep wound on Odium.

### Preparations
Killing Honor did not free Odium from Braize, and the sacrifice of the Herald [[Taln\|Taln]] meant that he could not send his armies to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. And so, for the next four and a half thousand years, he prepared for the time when Taln would break, allowing for one last [[Desolation\|Desolation]] -- the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].
Odium, though severely limited by Honor's actions, was nonetheless active. As one of his [[Unmade\|Unmade]], [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]], was still free, Odium sent him to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] to facilitate the [[Thrill\|Thrill]] among the Alethi. Over the centuries, the battle-rage brought about by Nergaoul became normal, and even desirable to the Alethi men; this developed affinity allowed Odium to control them using the Thrill. Moreover, the Thrill allowed Odium to groom a champion whom he could later put in command of his armies and use to release himself. In the final decades of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], such a potential champion appeared in the form of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. Odium focused on him to ensure he had as many hooks in him as possible.
Odium also focused on the [[Listener\|listeners]], a group of [[Singers\|singers]] that had denied him some centuries prior. On the day of a treaty between them and the Alethi, Odium used one of his [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] to lead them to buy an assassin, [[Szeth\|Szeth]], who was used when [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] found out that the Alethi king, [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]], intended to release the very gods the listeners had once fled. Whether Gavilar's plan was inspired by Odium or not, it pushed the listeners to assassinate him, leading to the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. The War brought tremendous losses to the listeners, until the idea of assuming the old forms of power grew appealing to them. Through Ulim, Odium persuaded the listeners to assume [[Stormform\|stormform]] and summon the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], beginning the True Desolation.

### True Desolation

As the True Desolation began and the [[Fused\|Fused]] started taking over human territory, Odium focused on [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] while maneuvering his forces towards [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], where the confrontation between the two sides would occur. He penetrated one of [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]] and let him believe that Odium was the Almighty for a short while before revealing himself. Although Dalinar refused to release him, Odium was certain that Dalinar would eventually do so, and showed him his true form when Dalinar began to get too comfortable. He did not, however, agree to the contest of champions Dalinar suggested.
Odium also interacted with [[Venli\|Venli]]. He stopped the Fused from taking her body and granted her [[Envoyform\|envoyform]] instead to spread his propaganda among the newly awakened singers. When she didn't work hard enough to his satisfaction, he tortured and threatened her, causing Venli to reconsider her current allegiance further.
Dalinar and Odium spoke once more in a different vision, after Dalinar attempted to negotiate with Venli. Odium initially attempted to tear the vision apart, although Dalinar managed to send Venli out of it before that could happen. Odium then appeared to Dalinar and scolded him for thinking that any sort of accord between the two races was possible, before reassuring Dalinar that peace would, indeed, happen -- after Roshar was destroyed.

For more information, see [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
Odium decided to lead his forces on [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] personally, although he didn't intend to use the plain [[Singer\|singers]] in battle. He first sent a pair of [[Thunderclast\|thunderclasts]], one to destroy the city walls, and the other to get to the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]], along with [[Fused\|Fused]] to ensure that the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]] wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. Then, Odium used [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] and the Alethi dependence on the [[Thrill\|Thrill]] to possess the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]] forces in the city and make them turn against their own allies.

>“*No. No, we killed you. WE KILLED YOU !*”
\-Odium upon seeing Honor's Perpendicularity

Odium then went, taking with him Venli and several other Fused, to confront Dalinar in front of the city. Dalinar once more repeated his demand for the contest of champions, and this time, Odium agreed, before revealing that his champion would be Dalinar himself. By reminding Dalinar of his past crimes, chief among them the murder of his wife, [[Evi\|Evi]], Odium attempted to persuade Dalinar to surrender his guilt and accept that it was all Odium's fault. However, though Dalinar was initially horrified, he refused to give in. Odium could only watch, speechless, as Dalinar's newfound resolve allowed him to swear the Third Ideal of the [[Bondsmiths\|Bondsmiths]] and open [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]].
This development horrified Odium, especially when he recognized whatever Dalinar became at this moment. Realizing that he lost his trump card -- and that Dalinar could now push him into a *real* contest of champions -- Odium swiftly retreated from the field, leaving his armies to lose the battle.


King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] had been planning to strike a deal with Odium for some time, as neither he nor his [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]] believed that defeating a god would be plausible. As such, he found a way to communicate with the Shard, both by writing and through actions such as opening the [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] to let the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] invade [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].

 by  Connor Chamberlain  Taravangian becoming Odium
Some time after the Battle of Thaylen Field, Odium obliged him, visiting him in Urithiru after Taravangian let him in by opening a window. Odium revealed that he knew perfectly well that Taravangian had both brilliant and less intelligent days, and deliberately visited on one of the latter, to make sure that Taravangian knew he had nothing to negotiate with. Though Odium praised the Diagram, he used it to show how much further his own future sight reached. This inadvertently let Taravangian know that Odium was unable to perceive anything involving [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]].
By reading the Diagram, Taravangian eventually managed to negotiate with Odium, though his initial offering of sparing anyone Taravangian ruled was discarded, with Odium pointing out that Taravangian sought to become the king of the whole of Roshar. Eventually, the two settled on sparing the citizens of Kharbranth and their spouses.


A year later, Odium brought Dalinar into a vision and agreed to set the terms of their contest. Although Odium's most important point was being able to leave Roshar--a restriction that Dalinar *could* have lifted, as the largest remnant of Honor's Investiture--Dalinar refused, deciding that since Honor had died to keep Odium in the system, that point would need to remain. At this point, Odium came very close to incinerating Dalinar, almost losing control of his Intent, but managed to keep his temper in check. After such points being raised as Odium's inability to stop the Fused from being reborn and Dalinar's inability to command the Radiants to follow Odium, they agreed that on the tenth day of the new month, they would each appoint a champion, and their champions would fight atop Urithiru, unhindered by either side, until one was dead. If Dalinar won, Odium would retreat to the kingdoms that he controlled at the time for one thousand years, but would cede control of Alethkar and [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]] to Dalinar so that he could keep his oath to the [[Dieno\|Mink]]. If Odium won, though, he personally would remain in the Roshar system, but would gain control of the kingdoms of the coalition--and Dalinar's soul, which would be turned into a [[Fused\|Fused]] to begin Odium's forays throughout the cosmere.

### Taravangian's Ascension
For the history of Odium's second Vessel prior to his Ascension, see Taravangian#History.
Later that day, Taravangian managed to get Szeth and Rayse to come to him at the same time. When Rayse pulled him into a vision, Taravangian grabbed [[Nightblood\|Nightblood's]] Cognitive aspect and stabbed Rayse with it, killing him. While he had been doing this, Szeth had stabbed him with his belt knife, but just as he died, Taravangian Ascended to become Odium. His previous [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]] afflictions seemed to vanish as soon as he Ascended, giving him both emotion and intelligence in far greater amounts and he possessed all the power of the Shard. Taravangian realized that Rayse had been sliding towards oblivion for a very long time, as he had been severely weakened by his previous battles, especially against [[Honor\|Honor]]; Rayse had been enslaved by the power he wielded. Rayse's body appeared in the place of Taravangian's, although it was so damaged by Nightblood that Szeth was unable to tell the difference. Some time later, when [[Hoid\|Hoid]] was walking the hallways in Elhokar's palace, Taravangian confronted him. When he asked Hoid what he would have done in Taravangian's place, Hoid realized that there was a new Vessel, and was unable to hide his terror. Taravangian then tampered with the Breaths that Wit was using to contain his memories, and retried the whole encounter, this time pretending to be Rayse much more effectively.

ODIUM REIGNS, the voice said more softly.


Throughout his existence, Odium has had profound effect on the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] and its various [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]]. He has been called the most frightening and terrible of all Shards, and with good reason.
On [[Sel\|Sel]], Odium's murder of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]] suffused the entirety of the planet's [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], fuelling its magic systems. The [[Seon\|seons]] and [[Skaze\|skaze]] are [[Splinter\|splinters]] of Devotion and Dominion respectively.
On [[Threnody\|Threnody]], Odium's battle with [[Ambition\|Ambition]] had vast ramifications for the entire system, though what exactly this entails is unclear. It's possible that the [[Evil\|Evil]] that had taken over [[Homeland\|Homeland]], as well as the [[Shade\|Shades]], is a side effect of the battle between the Shards. Harmony noted a wound on the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] itself where Ambition was Splintered.
On [[Roshar\|Roshar]], Odium's influence is felt most acutely through the numerous [[Desolation\|Desolations]] he caused, as well as the murder and subsequent splintering of [[Honor\|Honor]], which made the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] what he is today. He is known obliquely in the various religions of the world as the leader of the [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] and the force behind the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]]. In the present, the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] are his doing.

## Trivia
Odium's original name was Hatred; Brandon changed it because, in his words, it was "too on-the-nose", while the name Odium brought the Shard a step closer to Passion.
The mere mention of the word Odium makes [[Syl\|Syl]] hiss.
Odium is very scared of [[Harmony\|Harmony]].
Odium might currently have an alliance -- or, at least, an understanding -- with [[Bavadin\|Bavadin]], the holder of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], although he was considering double-crossing her after dealing with Honor and Cultivation. He's also allied with a cosmere power other than her.
