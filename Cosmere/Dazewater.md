**Dazewater** is a liquid that is used to anesthetize patients during surgery on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Properties
Dazewater is a very expensive clear liquid. In order to put a patient under, dazewater is poured onto a rag or bandage and then pressed to the patient's face, over their mouth and nose. When the patient breathes it in, pain is lessened and the patient becomes nonsensical, speaking gibberish and grinning.
Dazewater is so potent that the surgeon who applies it has to hold his breath in order to avoid breathing it in himself. In order to dispose of the dazewater, the rag it is soaked in has to be burned. The heat negates the dazewater, causing it to steam off the cloth. Dazewater can also be used to ease a person's pain as he dies.

## History
[[Lirin\|Lirin]] had [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] administer dazewater to Citylord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] and his son [[Rillir\|Rillir]] after they returned from their [[Whitespine\|whitespine]] hunt with serious injuries.
During the invasion of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] an ardent theorized, incorrectly, that a dazewater leak was causing the [[Knights Radiant\|Radiants]] to lose consciousness.
