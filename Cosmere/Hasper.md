**Haspers** are a form of mollusk on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. A **stranna hasper** refers to a variety of the mollusk that can be cooked and eaten.

## Appearance and Behavior
Haspers are comprised of two shells that enclose a slimy interior. These two shells open and close in rhythm with one another. Due to this motion, haspers are often compared to tiny mouths that are breathing. At least some varieties of haspers have pearly shells. They may be related to tiny snails.
Haspers are creatures that appear to spend most, if not all, of their life totally stationary. They grow in clusters, attached to the side of objects made of stone, wood, or on [[Shalebark\|shalebark]]. A cluster of haspers can support the weight of a few waterskins.
Haspers can be found in a wide variety of places across eastern Roshar, including the docks of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]], and the chasms of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. They reproduce during the [[Weeping\|Weeping]], with clusters seeming to grow out of nowhere. It is unknown what haspers feed on.

## Culinary Use
[[Adolin\|Adolin]] included steamed stranna haspers in a platter of food that he brought to [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] quarters in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after training her in the use of a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
[[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] ate a meal of steamed haspers just before discovering the humans.
