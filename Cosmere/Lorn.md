>“*They’re never going to let you out of here, Lorn. They don’t care about you. Why are you still loyal?*”
\-Peg to Lorn[1]


**Lorn** is a [[Heklo\|heklo]] pilot that works for the [[Superiority\|Superiority]], and is the base commander at the Superiority outpost of [[Surehold\|Surehold]]. He commands the group of fighter pilots defending Surehold, but only does so because the Superiority holds family captive.

## History
Lorn was forced to serve the Superiority when they took his family, and sent him to the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]], leaving his family behind. Lorn knew [[Peg\|Peg]], before Peg had to leave the station and become a pirate. Lorn made an alliance with [[Vlep\|Vlep]] and the [[Cannonade Faction\|Cannonade Faction]] when Peg and the other pirate factions assaulted Surehold as one. Lorn and his pilots fought against the attackers, but when Vlep and his ships left the battle, Lorn was defeated.

>“*You promise to do this for me? For everyone they’re holding? You’ll get them back through so we can be together?*”
\-Lorn to Peg[1]

He wouldn’t surrender, since the Superiority held his family, but Peg convinced him to help the pirates. Peg suggested that with Lorn’s knowledge of every security code, they could easily take the base, and seize the acclivity stone held there. They could hold the acclivity stone as a ransom to make the Superiority return Lorn’s family, as well as the families of Lorn’s companions. Lorn agreed, making Peg promise, then warned that they’d have to isolate and capture Superiority agents on the station, sent to watch him. With Lorn handing over security codes to Peg, they deactivated the anti-aircraft turrets so they could approach Surehold safely. Lorn led Peg and her sons to the base security center, where they obtained weapons, and sent out a call for all personnel to go to their quarters, making it easier to find and take care of dissidents. The base was taken smoothly, allowing [[Spensa Nightshade\|Spensa]] and [[Chet\|Chet]] access.
