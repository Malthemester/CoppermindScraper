## Toxicity
Dried blackbane leaves are poisonous. Ingesting them causes paralysis, which in turn keeps the victim from being able to breathe. Victims of blackbane poisining have visibly darkened skin afterwards. Blackbane is difficult to make to its full potency. For that, one must first let the leaves dry and then make it into a gum. The dried leaves are said to become more potent the longer they are aged. Ingesting the blackbane paste, however, does not kill as quickly as injecting the essence straight into the blood.

## History
During his time in [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv's]] slave caravan, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] managed to find a blackbane plant and hid a few leaves in a makeshift belt. One night he took them out to contemplate what he planned to do with them, thinking of either trying to poison Tvlakv or committing suicide. He ended up accidentally crushing and subsequently losing them in his anger over Tvlakv's execution of a sick slave. [[Sylphrena\|Syl]] was curious about the leaves, but Kaladin was reluctant to tell her anything. Later, Syl tracked down a blackbane leaf for Kaladin in a misguided attempt to cheer him up. She got back with it just as Kaladin was getting ready to give up and jump into the [[Honor Chasm\|Honor Chasm]]. She was unaware that blackbane was poisonous, but had noticed that Kaladin seemed to become depressed after losing the leaves in the slave wagon. She hoped that having a new one would cheer him up and renew his desire to fight. Thanks to this kind (though misguided) action on Syl's part, Kaladin decided against jumping and returned to [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] with renewed purpose.
[[Wikim Davar\|Wikim Davar]] gave [[Shallan\|Shallan]] a bag of dried blackbane that he had been carrying for over a year to indicate that he no longer wanted to kill himself thanks to her compassion in directing his study. She eventually used it in an attempt to kill her [[Lin Davar\|father]] after he killed his wife [[Malise Gevelmar\|Malise Gevelmar]].
The tip of the darts fired at [[Taln\|Taln]] during his kidnapping from the warcamp monastery were coated with blackbane.
The [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] [[Nikliasorm\|Nikliasorm]] used blackbane to kill [[Screech\|Screech]]. Later, it tried to pin the murder on [[Cord\|Cord]] by claiming to find blackbane in her quarters, but [[Rysn Ftori\|Rysn]] saw through the lie.
[[Vathah\|Vathah]] knew of an officer in [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas']] army who utilized blackbane to commit suicide after it was discovered he was smuggling. [[Ishnah\|Ishnah's]] gang also utilized the poison, and [[Shallan\|Radiant]] used blackbane to kill [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] with a needle hidden in her satchel.
