## Summary
For a detailed summary, see Summary: Dreamer.
Dreamer is engaged in a game of cops and robbers in Manhattan with his fellow gamer poltergeists. In the game, Dreamer and his team of four other players are trying to protect [[Longshot\|Longshot]] from being captured by [[Phi\|Phi]], who is playing as the criminal. Each player is allowed to possess only a limited number of bodies and to use whatever means necessary, including deadly force, to win.
During the game, Dreamer is pursuing Phi, who manages to kill the person Dreamer had possessed, using a body with a gun. In the ensuing panic among the living, Dreamer possesses the body of an old woman, alerts his teammates, and then [[Bolting\|Bolts]] into the body of [[Lorenzo\|a responding police officer]]. Dreamer finds Phi again and fires his gun indiscriminately into the crowd of onlookers in an attempt to kill him. As the crowd scatters in horror, [[Marks (Dreamer)\|another police officer]] shoots and kills the body Phi was possessing. Phi then promptly possesses the body of the second police officer and runs after Longshot.
Dreamer pursues Phi to the top of a building and tackles him off before he can reach Longshot. Both police officers die in the fall, leaving Dreamer with no bodies left to use. In poltergeist form, he holds Phi back from possessing his final body long enough for [[Rabies\|Rabies]] to take it into custody, causing Phi to lose the game. Phi complains that Dreamer cheated by firing into the crowd and Longshot says that they should ban guns. The group decides to meet up in New Jersey to get away from the carnage they caused in Manhattan. Dreamer agrees to a footrace with Phi as their rivalry continues.

## Characters

## Setting
The standalone setting for *Dreamer* is Manhattan, on Earth in the early 21st century. There are no apparent differences from the real Earth except for the existence of poltergeists.

## Development
When Charlaine Harris approached Brandon about writing a short story for *Games Creatures Play*, he immediately wanted to be a part of the project after hearing the concept. He had never written a horror story before, so he thought of the scariest thing he could imagine, which was the kids who play Xbox having control over real peoples' lives. This concept became the seed for *Dreamer*, which Brandon considers different from any of his other writing. He has mentioned that he likes detective stories, which is why *Dreamer* has its roots in the genre, along with *Snapshot* and *Legion*.

## Publication History

## Trivia
As of December 2017, *Dreamer* had no options out for film or TV adaptations.
Brandon has said that he occasionally thinks about going back to the setting of *Dreamer*, but that he hasn't found the right thing to do with it because it's so different from the rest of his writing.
In August of 2013, Brandon released  on his website.
