**Ashgress** is the Fjordell ambassador to [[Teod\|Teod]] during the [[Late Era\|Late Era]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].

## History
Just before the [[Invasion of Arelon\|invasion of Arelon]], Ashgress was recalled to the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]], despite the fact that the Fjordish had worked hard to get an ambassador in the Teo court. Ashgress took his entire entourage with him, and left the country after one final speech on the docks of [[Teoras\|Teoras]]. Ashgress was likely recalled on the direct orders of [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]] himself.
This action made [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]], the king of [[Teod\|Teod]] very nervous about Fjordish intentions for Teod. His daughter [[Sarene\|Sarene]] worried that Ashgress's retreat was a sign that the Fjordell Empire had given up entirely on the idea of converting Teod to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]].
