## Appearance and Personality
VarSell is seen wearing a quartz [[True Body\|True Body]] in the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]]. He keeps his skin translucent so that the sparkling bones are visible. He generally respects kandra traditions, including the societal structure that places value on seniority. He is hostile towards TenSoon and exhibits a temper, but is able to restrain himself.

## Attributes and Abilities
For more information, see [[Kandra\|Kandra]].
VarSell has the typical shapeshifting abilities of a kandra. In addition, he has [[Iron\|iron]] [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spikes known as the [[Blessing of Potency\|Blessing of Potency]] that grant him additional strength; he is also relatively large for a kandra. He is not as skilled as TenSoon in crafting a body from bones that he has not personally digested. His quartz True Body is worn for beauty, rather than practicality.

## History
VarSell was one of [[TenSoon\|TenSoon's]] captors when TenSoon was imprisoned prior to his Judgement. He was surprised at both the accuracy and speed of TenSoon's shapeshifting abilities after providing him with a random set of bones. When TenSoon insulted the Second Generation over how long it took them to form bodies, VarSell nearly slapped him, which TenSoon found ironic since he was also VarSell's superior. He and several other guards with the Blessing of Potency then walked behind TenSoon while escorting him to his Judgement; to avoid a show, they stuck to back corridors.
On the orders of the Second Generation, VarSell returned TenSoon's wolfhound bones to at the end of the monthlong period between his Judgement and sentencing. He informed TenSoon that [[KanPaar\|KanPaar]] and the others of the Second Generation intended to break his bones as part of his punishment and that they did not want to waste human bones. He also laughed at the notion of a kandra wearing animal bones, and said that being forced to wear them will help the other kandra understand that TenSoon was not a "true" kandra.
