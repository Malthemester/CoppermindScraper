This article is about the non-magical weapon. For information related to living Shardblades in the shape of a hammer, see Shardblade#Radiant Shardblades.
A **shardhammer**, also known as a **warhammer** is an enormous battle hammer that can only be wielded by someone in [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. Contrary to what it's name might suggest, it is not an ancient magical weapon like Shardplate or a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], but rather, a more modern creation. Dalinar's warhammer is described as having a haft as "thick as a man's wrist" with the front of the head being larger than a man's fist. It could barely be lifted by two men and was carried on a cart. A Shardbearer's hammer is a common weapon for someone who owns a set of plate, but no Shardblade.
