**Andrew Nalizar** is a professor of [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatics]] at [[Armedius Academy\|Armedius Academy]].

## Attributes and Abilities
He is a very powerful Rithmatist. As an experienced duelist, he draws very fast and prefers simple, offensive-oriented defenses and [[Chalklings\|Chalklings]]. His power was originally granted by a [[Shadowblaze\|Shadowblaze]], but after the event in the [[Tower of Nebrask\|Tower of Nebrask]], as he was almost certainly replaced by a [[Forgotten\|Forgotten]], the source of his powers likely were as well.

## History
Nalizar got his coat three years prior to the events of [[The Rithmatist\|the Rithmatist]] at [[Maineford Academy\|Maineford Academy]], then spent two years at fighting at [[Nebrask\|Nebrask]] until he came to Armedius Academy. He is considered a hero for his service at Nebrask; he lead the expedition to recover [[William Muns\|William Muns's]] body.
Shortly after becoming a professor at Armedius Academy, Nalizar challenged Professor [[Fitch\|Fitch]] to a duel. By winning this duel he and Professor Fitch exchanged places in seniority: Nalizar became a tenured professor and Fitch fell back to the lowest rank, tutoring professor.
He spent much of his time at Armedius researching books on Rithmatics, which was later speculated by [[Joel Saxon\|Joel Saxon]] to be a means of ascertaining humanity's understanding of Rithmatics.
He was present during the defeat of the [[Scribbler\|Scribbler]], who he claimed to have tracked from Nebrask. He was inadvertently splashed with acid by Joel Saxon and knocked unconscious by one of the Scribbler's Lines of Revocation. He was lauded by as a hero by Joel after the battle.
Joel talked with Nalizar before the grand melee to apologize for suspecting him. Joel realized that Harding hadn’t attacked Nalizar, and that Nalizar hadn’t seemed suprised that Harding had been in the dormitory that night. Joel saw that Nalizar had the same blackness behind his eyes as Inspector Harding, who was possessed by a [[Forgotten\|Forgotten]], indicating that Nalizar likely is as well. He all but admitted to being one during his conversation with Joel. He convinced Joel that nobody will believe any accusations against him, given Joel's prior retracted accusation and praise following the defeat of the Scribbler.
