>“*Lives will be lost. It has ever been our burden as the Sons of Honor. To return the Heralds, to return the dominance of the Church, we had to put the world into a crisis.*”
\-Amaram's letter to Restares[1]


The **Sons of Honor** are a secretive group on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Their goal is to return the dominance of the [[Vorinism\|Vorin]] church. They seem to be under the leadership of [[Restares\|Restares]], and are referred to as his cronies by the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]].

## Beliefs
The beliefs between the highest leadership of the Sons of Honor and its members are generally at odds with each other.
Like the [[Envisagers\|Envisagers]], the Sons of Honor believe that by returning the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] they will cause the [[Herald\|Heralds]] to return as well. They believe this will usher in a new era of Vorin dominance. This is the reason for many of their members joining but some leaders such as Gavilar and Restares do not think this is the case and have different motives for their actions.
The Sons of Honor appear ruthless and have little regard for the loss of innocent life in the pursuit of their goals. Despite their organization being based around Vorinism, their leaders do not appear to strictly follow the gender norms dictated by the church. [[Amaram\|Amaram]] uses the [[Stormwarden script\|stormwarden script]] to get around the prohibitions on writing. Restares likely knows it as well, given Amaram's letter was written in the script. The group also identifies itself as highly patriotic and loyal to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] despite this however they consider the monarchy of Alethkar to be heretics and seeks to overthrow them and replace them with [[Ialai\|Ialai]]. Ialai however has no interest in becoming queen and instead seeks to instate [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]] as King.
Of the organizations that are aware of the Voidbringers and the [[Desolation\|Desolations]], the Sons of Honor are the most incorrect in their beliefs and actions regarding that knowledge.

## History
The Sons of Honor have similar origins to the Diagram. At some point the Envisagers formed as a splinter group of the Sons of Honor.
The Sons of Honor existed before [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] joined their organization, but he helped to greatly expand their numbers and influence. Notably, he was the one who recruited Amaram to join them. The group was mainly founded upon religious grounds aiming to restart the Desolations. Some leaders of the group, such as Gavilar and Restares, had additional motives and plans for the group, both primarily used the Sons of Honor to further their own goals. Restares responded favorably to Gavilar's plans and the two worked together to return the Desolations. Gavilar held a variety of meetings with the leadership of the Sons of Honor as well as their leader Restares. On the night of his death, more of these meetings took place. Gavilar suspected the Ghostbloods of being behind the assassination though he also considered Restares might have been responsible.
Following the death of Gavilar, Restares and Amaram made more frequent contact with each other, with Amaram seemingly taking over from Gavilar's previous role. However he ultimately served and followed the orders of Restares, often deferring to him for guidance. Under his leadership, Restares managed to convince Amaram to take the Shards [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] won and kill any witnesses, and Amaram decided to spare and enslave Kaladin as a sign of his thanks instead. Amaram later would be sent to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to help with the war effort there, while at the Plains, he continued his research into the connection between the [[Listener\|Parshendi]] and Voidbringers as well as trying to find the lost city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Amaram sent word to Restares that the Sons of Honor were successful in restarting the Desolations, though in truth they had no part in starting the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. It is unknown if Amaram actually believed he had helped restart the Desolations. Before leaving to settle in Urithiru, Amaram recognized that the madman in Dalinar's warcamp was in fact [[Taln\|Taln]] and went to recover him from his cell. At this time he survived an assassination attempt by the Ghostbloods.
During the move highprinces [[Thanadal\|Thanadal]] and [[Loradar Vamah\|Vamah]] decided to stay at the warcamps. Thanadal took the opportunity to create his own virtual kingdom in the area and control trade through the Shattered Plains. Vamah acted similarly. Following the death of [[Torol Sadeas\|Highprince Sadeas]] during the settling of Urithiru, Ialai took over from her husbands duties. At this time the Ghostbloods began actively spying on her due to her status as an unknown element. Ialai decided to name Amaram as the new highprince of House Sadeas. At the orders of Dalinar Kholin, Amaram and Sadeas forces were moved to help clean up and secure [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. [[Odium\|Odium]] used Amaram's frustrations at these orders as well as the truth about the [[Heralds\|Heralds]] to convince him to join Odium's forces. With this change, the Sadeas troops also defected. Amaram was killed during the battle.
After the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], House Sadeas was humiliated, and Ialai became the leader of the Sons of Honor and she moved back to the Shattered Plains. She did what she could to regain the previous power of the Sons of Honor but due to the death of Gavilar and the actions taken during Amaram's leadership, there was little she could do. Ialai spent most of her time trying to get in contact with Restares and also began to investigate references she had heard before to the wider [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. The Ghostbloods began a final push to eliminate the Sons of Honor and began by assassinating Thanadal despite his attempts to negotiate. Seeing this, Vamah attempted to flee the Plains but was also killed by the Ghostbloods. Seeing these events Ialai decided to try and hide within her lands. This ultimately failed and she was assassinated by a [[Shallan Davar\|Ghostblood agent]]. At this stage it was believed by Mraize that the Sons of Honor were destroyed. Following its destruction, Shallan was given a mission to locate their ultimate and last surviving leader, Restares.

## Relationships
The Sons of Honor have an antagonistic relationship with both the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] and the [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]]. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] sends [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to spy on Amaram in order to discover what secrets the Sons of Honor know. After receiving Shallan's intelligence, they unsuccessfully try to assassinate him. After the Battle of Thaylan Field, the Ghostbloods spent the next year successfully assassinating the leadership of the Sons of Honor. The Ghostbloods also greatly hate and despise Restares for assisting Gavilar. Despite this however, Mraize acts dismissive towards the Sons of Honor, referring to them simply as Restares's cronies. The Skybreakers also tried to have Amaram killed as a strike against the Sons of Honor when they send [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]] to his army with [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] to kill him. This plan, however, resulted in the Sons of Honor gaining control of another set of shards. The leader of the Skybreakers, [[Nale\|Nale]] also assisted the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] in assassinating Gavilar Kholin.
The [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] likely knows about the Sons of Honor, as [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] was a member of Gavilar's trusted inner circle. It is not clear if the Sons of Honor are aware of the formation and actions of the Diagram. The two organizations have similar origins in their awareness of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] but different philosophies on what should be done about it.
