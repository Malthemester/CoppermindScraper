## History
Vamah princedom was one of the ten princedoms reunited into a single country under [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]]. Its highprince resisted unification for most of Gavilar's campaign, though by the time direct conflict occurred, the region was close to flipping its allegiances. The Kholin defeat of Highlord [[Kalanor\|Kalanor's]] army, marked the turning point and subsequent end of the war for unification.
After the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], the city of [[Revolar\|Revolar]] is conquered by the singers and parshmen throughout the nearby regions begin to converge on the city. Both [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Moash\|Moash]] pass through Revolar (though at different points in time) after it has been claimed by the singers. Before his arrival in Revolar, Kaladin and a group of parshmen shelter from a [[Highstorm\|Highstorm]] at a waystop within the lands of Highlord [[Cadilar\|Cadilar]].

## Politics
### Government
[[Loradar Vamah\|Loradar Vamah]] succeeded Kalanor as Highprince in the year 1145 after Kalanor was killed by [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. This transfer of power was engineered by Gavilar Kholin during his campaign to unify Alethkar, as Loradar was sympathetic to his cause and would swear fealty to House Kholin. Highlord [[Paladar\|Paladar]], a relative of the Highprince, is named as regent when the Alethi declare war on the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] and march to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].

### Military
After the death of King Gavilar Kholin in 1167, Highprince Vamah calls to arms the people of his kingdom to fulfil the [[Vengeance Pact\|Vengeance Pact]]. In [[Farcoast\|Farcoast]] there is a high response to the call for enlistment, with every one in two men of age joining the army.
