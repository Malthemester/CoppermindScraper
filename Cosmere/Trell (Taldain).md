## Appearance and Personality
Trell has a bald head and wears the dull, loose-fitting clothes and leather boots of a laborer in Lossand. Trell is a selfless man who cares deeply for his subordinates, and he treats [[Kenton\|Kenton]] with a great deal of respect.

## History
Kenton once saved some of Trell's crew by holding up the roof of a structure after the scaffolding collapsed, allowing them time to escape. Fearing retribution upon his crew for displeasing a [[Sand mastery\|sand master]], Trell initially acted highly subservient toward Kenton and took the blame for the collapse upon himself. Kenton's act earned Trell's trust and respect. At Kenton's command, he delightedly dismissed his crew for the day after the disaster, so that they might spend time with their families.

## Trivia
The naming of Trell was intentional, but the connections are a little obtuse.
