Venture is a man that cannot handle his liquor. He was also a sort-of friend of High Lord [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]]. Wax's fianc√©e, Lady [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]], was concerned about the possibility of a disturbance at their wedding, and attempted to plan a small controlled problem that they could handle. Wax suggested that they invite Douglas Venture so that he could cause a drunken disturbance at the after-party. Steris agreed and Venture was invited.
