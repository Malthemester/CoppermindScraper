The **Cult of Returned** was a religion on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] and the precursor to the [[Iridescent Tones\|Iridescent Tones]], the theocratic government of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].

## History
[[Austrism\|Austrism]] was once the primary religion of [[Hanald\|Hanald]], the kingdom that preceded [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] and [[Idris\|Idris]]. The doctrine of Austrism held that a deity named Austre resurrected the Returned. However, the Cult of Returned believed that the Returned themselves were gods. They believed that their duty was to care for their gods and supply them with [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]] until they could perform a divine task, after which they were free to give away their divine Breath and die a second time. When [[Vasher\|Vasher]] Returned, the Cult of Returned found him, provided him with Breaths, and gave him the name Warbreaker the Peaceful. The Cult of Returned also knew of [[Shashara\|Shashara]] and named her Glorysinger.
After the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] and the shattering of Hanald, Austrism turned its back on [[Awakening\|Awakening]] and began to consider it an abomination. The worship of Returned was considered "pagan", a perspective that is maintained by modern day followers of Austrism. Meanwhile, the Cult of Returned came to prominence in Hallandren, evolving into the [[Iridescent Tones\|Iridescent Tones]]. The religion presumably became entrenched in Hallandren when Vasher created the first [[God King\|God King]] by bestowing [[Peacegiver's Treasure\|Peacegiver's Treasure]]. Although the rule of the Returned is not without fault, citizens of Hallandren still generally follow many of the tenets first established by the Cult of Returned.
