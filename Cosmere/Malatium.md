**Malatium** is an alloy of [[Atium\|atium]] and [[Gold\|gold]]. The exact use is unclear; it allows an [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]] to see either who another person was in the past, or who they could have become if they had made different choices. This metal is referred to in legend as the **Eleventh Metal**. It is described as being silvery white in color, similar to porcelain.

## Allomantic Use
Malatium acts as a counterpart to [[Atium\|atium]], in that it allows an Allomancer to see into another person's past.
Flaring malatium allows an Allomancer to see not just a malatium shadow of a person, but seems to give them a glimpse into the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], allowing them to see a vision of a past event in another person's life by seeing their [[Connection\|Connection]] and their past.
Malatium is different from other Allomantic metals in that, when it is burned, the Allomancer does not draw upon the power of Preservation. Instead, its effects are powered by Ruin's [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in the atium of the alloy.

## Feruchemical Use
Malatium, when used by a [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]], has unknown properties.

## Hemalurgic use
When used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, malatium steals some unknown trait or quality.

## History
While learning Allomancy from [[Gemmel\|Gemmel]], [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] infiltrates [[Keep Shezler\|Keep Shezler]] and, after defeating the Mistborn [[Antillius Shezler\|Antillius Shezler]], comes across Shezler's notes theorizing about a possible eleventh Allomantic metal. Even after becoming [[Harmony\|Harmony]], [[Sazed\|Sazed]] could not find any prior legends about an eleventh metal and concluded that the legends were likely fabricated by [[Ruin\|Ruin]] to help drive Kelsier's plan to kill the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. Between Shezler's apparent mental instability, which might have allowed Ruin to speak to him, and Ruin's ability to manipulate text, it is entirely plausible that Ruin could have been behind the creation of Shezler's notes. Furthermore, Gemmel, the person who directed Kelsier to Keep Shezler and drew his attention to Shezler's notes in the first place, showed signs of being manipulated by Ruin, suggesting that Ruin was indeed intentionally leading Kelsier to the notes.
