The **mountains of Ur** are a mountain range in central Roshar. [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] is located there.

## Geography
The mountains of Ur lie in the center of the [[Rosharan\|Rosharan]] supercontinent. They run east to west; in the west, they split into two parts turning north and south, forming a sideways Y shape. They border a number of central Rosharan nations, including [[Yulay\|Yulay]] and [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]] in the north, [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved's]] [[Bavland\|Bavland]] in the east, [[Triax\|Triax]], [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]], [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]] and [[Marat\|Marat]] to the south, and [[Emul\|Emul]] and [[Azir\|Azir]] in the east.
The mountains are cold, barren and incredibly high; only the tallest [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] reach anywhere close to their peaks. A deep layer of pristine white snow is a permanent fixture of the environment, and life is sparse outside a few livable areas. Up there, the air is frigid, full of [[Coldspren\|coldspren]] clinging to any surface. The air pressure is so low as to pose difficulties for people who wish to live there. Far lower, however, the mountains are also home to the verdant [[Valley\|Valley]] of the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]], full of all manner of plant and animal life.
Ur itself is a mountain that no longer exists. Originally, it stood in the very center of the mountains, where the range splits into the northward and southward branch. At some point in the distant past, it was reshaped into the tower city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], which stands there to this day. The mountains itself do not seem to have a name of their own, and take their name after Ur.

## Inhabitants
The region is sparsely inhabited, with most cities in the lower foothills; the largest settlements there are the mining city of [[Zawfix\|Zawfix]] in [[Azir\|Azir]] and [[Silnasen\|Silnasen]], in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] borderlands. No country claims ownership over the mountains themselves, perhaps due to the difficulties of settling there. Nonetheless, there are still people who live there, most of them in small, isolated villages.
The largest settlement in the mountains proper is [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], the grand tower of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Transformed from mount Ur, Urithiru houses thousands, if not tens of thousands of people, both before its abandonment by the original Radiants and after its rediscovery by the [[Alethi\|Alethi]]. The city is a massive collection of [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] designed to assist people in surviving in such extreme climates, including heating and air pressure manipulators.
At least two unique [[Spren\|spren]] make their home in the mountains of Ur. In the tower city itself lives the [[Sibling\|Sibling]], Urithiru's own spren, responsible for maintaining the city's infrastructure. Far lower, in the [[Valley\|Valley]], the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]] holds her court. It's also where [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] will occasionally manifest. The [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] also lived there for hundreds of years; it's unknown if she remained in the mountains following [[Shallan\|Shallan]] banishing her from Urithiru.
