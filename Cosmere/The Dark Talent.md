## Cover Blurb
>“* Alcatraz Smedry has successfully defeated the army of Evil Librarians and saved the kingdom of Mokia. Too bad he managed to break the Smedry Talents in the process. Even worse, his father is trying to enact a scheme that could ruin the world, and his friend, Bastille, is in a coma. To revive her, Alcatraz must infiltrate the Highbrary–known as The Library of Congress to Hushlanders–the seat of Evil Librarian power. Without his Talent to draw upon, can Alcatraz figure out a way to save Bastille and defeat the Evil Librarians once and for all?*”

## Behind the Scenes
Brandon had always claimed that the Alcatraz series was to consist of five books, and that the original publisher, Scholastic, had only bought the first four. Since Scholastic would not contract the fifth book, Brandon bought back the rights in early 2013. He later re-sold the series, including book 5, to Tor.
In reality, there was always a sixth book planned. Tor was one of the publishers willing to promote the five-book series with the grand reveal at the end: that there would actually be a sixth book, written from another character's perspective. The idea was that Alcatraz would end his narrative with his failure, but the sixth book would confirm to the readers that he was indeed a hero.
