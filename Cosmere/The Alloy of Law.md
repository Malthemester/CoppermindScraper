## Plot Summary
For a chapter-by-chapter summary, see [[The Alloy of Law/Summary\|/Summary]].
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] is a lawman of the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], the harsh outland far from civilized society where it is said honor goes to die. In the wake of his uncle's death, Wax is summoned back to [[Elendel\|Elendel]] to assume his duties as the lord of [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]]. Despite trying to acclimatise to the radically different lifestyle and settle down with an arranged marriage - [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]], daughter of [[Jackstom Harms\|Jackstom Harms]], a wealthy but stern woman is to be married to Wax to secure a future for the both of their houses - Wax realizes it's not in his nature to simply put down his guns. That's when an [[Wayne\|old friend]] shows up with a proposition.
Wax and Wayne are old partners, close friends, and are both incredibly powerful Twinborn. With Wax's return to the city, Wayne was left in charge of Weathering, a small town out in the Roughs, appearing now on the trail of the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]]; an infamous gang of thieves renowned for their bizarre theatrics and efficiency. Wax's desire to investigate the recent robberies itches at him.
Putting on appearances for the public eye Wax and Steris attend the wedding reception hosted by the Yomens. They meet with Lord Harms and Steris' cousin, [[Marasi\|Marasi]].
Wayne speaks with Wax while Steris and Lord Harms are not around - Marasi had recognised him through his waiter's disguise, having attended the previous meeting at Wax's house with her cousin and uncle where he impersonated Wax's uncle on his mother's side. They each confirm their suspicions to the link shared by the Vanishers' kidnappings, right before the ballroom is invaded by the Vanishers themselves.
Steris is taken hostage while Wax attempts to calm Wayne. Marasi is also kidnapped but in the ensuing gun battle instigated by Wax and Wayne she is able to break free of her captors and provide assistance in the fight. Steris is kidnapped and the trio manage to overcome the staggering number of Vanishers without causing a single casualty amongst the bystanders.
After the fight, Wax has an argument with the local Octant's constable Captain, [[Brettin\|Brettin]]. Lord Harms then begs for Wax to find Steris, and afte Wax agrees, he leaves, seeming to be in shock. Wayne then steals an [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] gun from the evidence pile, giving it to Wax.
The next day, Marasi visits the Ladrian mansion to find Wax deep in his work with metallurgy, trying to determine the exact alloy of the gun Wayne had given him. Realizing he'd been up all night, Wax shows her what else he'd been working on, pulling out a genealogical tree plotted by himself using information in his uncle's library. Marasi leads him to a startling discovery before Wayne shows up with a report on his own investigation; Wayne had infiltrated the Fourth Octant constabulary to gain knowledge of the Vanishers' hideout from the prisoners.
[[Tillaume\|Tillaume]] - Wax's butler - brews Wax a tea and Wayne takes it for himself. Going back to make another and Wayne suddenly declares, passively, that the tea is poisoned before collapsing to the floor. Tillaume turns to face Wax, pistol in hand, but Wax gains the upper hand. While Wax is checking on Wayne, who has slightly recovered from the poison thanks to his goldmind, Marasi cries out as she notices Tillaume activating the bomb he'd brought with him.
Wayne throws up a speed bubble just as the explosion bursts from the basket. Wax increases his weight Feruchemically and breaks through to the floor below with Marasi on top and Wayne following to land on both of them. They escape the explosion but Wayne is left badly burnt and so with little of his goldmind remaining.
After surviving the assassination attempt, the three of them sneak out of the mansion and head for the location of the Vanishers hideout. There they find clues to the nature of their operations and a strong indicator as to who's leading them. [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]], or Miles "Hundredlives" as he's known. It is also made clear of Marasi's Allomantic power as a [[Pulser\|Pulser]] that Wax attempts to console her rather bitter feelings towards.
Meanwhile, Miles talks to [[Mister Suit\|Mister Suit]], their mysterious benefactor. He berates Miles for failing at the Yomen party and losing so many men and equipment and Miles is forced to assure Suit that Wax will be dealt with.
In the Outer Estates, Wax investigates the scene of one of the Vanishers' robberies with Wayne imposing personal and what he probably thinks, important, questions on Marasi about her affection for Wax. They discuss their theories before heading back into the city via train. That is when Miles attacks Wax and almost kills him in the their fight. Using his allomantic skills Wax is able to knock Miles from the train. Needing a place to lay low for awhile [[Ranette\|Ranette]] gets a visit she's most unappreciative of, shoving a shotgun in Wax's face. Wayne bribes their way into her affection by giving her Wax's aluminum gun, much to his dismay.
Ranette provides Wax with a set of Hazekiller rounds and a new gun - a prototype that she named "Vindication" after the [[Vin\|Ascendant Warrior]]. Sending Wayne and Marasi on supply runs, Wax sits down to plot where the Vanishers will strike next. The Tekiel's [[Breaknaught\|Breaknaught]] seems the prime target set to make it's maiden trip tomorrow. With a craftily planned distraction, Wax manages to slip aboard the Breaknaught and it sets off with him inside.
The Vanishers show up as expected, with Wayne and Marasi watching from afar witness how the Vanishers pull off their robberies; lifting the entire car off the tracks, a canal boat and crane steal the Breaknaught, replacing the stolen car with a replica. In Miles' workshop he makes an educated guess that Wax is inside the Breaknaught. Wrenching the door out of its frame the inside of the safe is still. Miles notices the length of string tied to the back of the door from the interior of the safe, shortly before Wax, hidden inside, pulls the string tight and setting off the dynamite taped to the back of the door.
Wax evades the Vanishers in their warehouse and comes up against Tarson. The Pewterarm knocks Vindication from his grip and the roof explodes, permitting Wayne to drop down and save Wax. Wayne confronts Tarson and Wax leaps for Vindication which is Pushed up through the roof by Mister Suit's Coinshot thug. Retrieving it, Wax has a fierce battle outside with the Coinshot and now a Lurcher. Marasi brings down the Lurcher with her rifle, but the Coinshot forces Wax and Marasi back into the warehouse. Wax rushes the Vanishers to help out Wayne before noticing Miles. Throwing himself inside the train car Miles follows and is caught in Wax's trap shortly before blowing himself up to escape. Wax is seriously injured and Wayne in turn is shot trying to assist Wax.
Wax has an odd conversation with Harmony and finds the trunk Tillaume had stored his guns in. Emerging from the mists with his mistcloak on, re-armed, he shoots Miles before Miles can do anything. Wax kills the Coinshot with one of Ranette's Hazekiller rounds and goes after Miles, saving Steris and [[Nouxil\|Nouxil]] in the process before demolishing the entire building.
Tarson appears with Marasi as a hostage and Wayne puts up a speed bubble that Wax uses to kill Tarson.
Wayne escapes and Wax fights Miles barehanded. Miles overpowers Wax thanks to his healing ability. A little while later, it becomes apparent that it was just a delaying tactic to allow Wayne to mobilize the constabulary. Marasi has had them in a [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] bubble (slowing down time for those inside), allowing the constabulary to get there and arrest Miles.
Back at the constabulary, Marasi is turned down by Wax and Wax receives a forbearance from Brettin. This surprises Wax at Brettin's sudden change in character but he is thankful. Steris shows a little vulnerability and Wax agrees that they should go ahead with their engagement, though he feels a slight regret for Marasi.
Marasi watches Miles' execution and Wax tracks down his uncle. Wax had suspected his uncle was still alive and playing the role of Mister Suit. [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]] still has possession of the kidnapped women and Wax's sister. Thinking his uncle broke, Edwarn shows Wax the broadsheet that announces Tekiel's collapse because of the robberies, explaining that they, Edwarn and his associates, bought the Tekiel's business. With no proof to incriminate his uncle Wax grows angry. He has to restrain himself from pulling out a gun but he assures his uncle that he will one day kill him.
Back at Miles' execution, Marasi turns to leave when Hundredlives is finally dead and notices a strange figure. She follow him through alleyways until eventually coming face-to-face with [[Marsh\|Ironeyes]]. The former [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]] gives Marasi a book to give to Wax, saying that he gave it to Marasi because Wax would likely shoot him for his appearance. Ironeyes reveals he is an agent of Harmony, and that he wishes for Wax to be sufficiently informed.
Meeting up with Wayne, Wax shows him the pocket book he swiped from his uncle containing appointments and notes. Wax is determined to stop his uncle.
