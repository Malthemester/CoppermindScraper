>“*At these points, Physical matter, Cognitive thought, and Spiritual essence become one--and a being can slide between Realms.*”
\-From Khriss's essay on the Drominad system[1]


A **perpendicularity** is a stable junction between the [[Physical Realm\|Physical]], [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]], and [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realms]]. They are used by [[Worldhoppers\|worldhoppers]] such as [[Hoid\|Hoid]] to go from planet to planet. They are formed through the concentration of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Because of this, they are most commonly found at places where a Shard's power is focused, often in the form of a pool of liquid. A Shard can control where their perpendicularity manifests.

## Mechanics
Perpendicularities are formed at locations with a large concentration of Investiture. The concentration of Investiture brings the three realms closer together and allows travel between them. The proximity of the realms also makes [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] easier. They occur naturally when a [[Shard\|Shard]] spends lots of time on a world. Generally, leaving a planet would cause the Shard's perpendicularity to disappear. As a result, their presence is often used to indicate the presence of a Shard. Special circumstances, however, can prevent the perpendicularity from disappearing, and there is at least one Shard that fits these circumstances. [[Aluminum\|Aluminum]] can be used to take liquid from a perpendicularity, and it will stay Invested. They can be used to see into the Spiritual Realm. [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] is able to collapse a perpendicularity. Some perpendicularities are more Invested than others. The enormous concentration of Investiture in a perpendicularity makes it possible to become a Cognitive Shadow by entering one.

## Known Perpendicularities

**Ruin**: the pool below the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] was [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] perpendicularity; it was the main path used by inter-world traders before it was destroyed by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]].
**Preservation**: [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] perpendicularity was the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. It served as [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] prison, making it extremely dangerous.
**Harmony**: Whether [[Harmony\|Harmony]] has a perpendicularity, and whether it's one or two perpendicularities, has not been revealed. An article in *The House Record* mentions a woman coming across a perfectly blue pool somewhere in the mountains in the Southern [[Roughs\|Roughs]], and a sudden appearance of a strange figure by the pool. It's possible, though not confirmed, that this could be Harmony's perpendicularity.

**Devotion**: [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|The Pool]] near [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] is [[Devotion\|Devotion's]] perpendicularity.
**Dominion**: There is a second perpendicularity on Sel, presumably of [[Dominion\|Dominion]].

Threnody does not have a stable perpendicularity, but rather a number of unstable, unpredictable ones of a morbid origin. They may possibly have something to do with the creation of [[Shade\|Shades]], although the fact that the Shard of [[Ambition\|Ambition]] has died near the system has far greater influence on their creation. It is more of a circumstance than a location.

First of the Sun is notable for having a perpendicularity, presumably [[Patji's Eye\|Patji's Eye]], without a Shard in residence. However, [[Patji (being)\|Patji]] is an avatar of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], which is likely the cause of the perpendicularity.

**Cultivation**: [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] is located in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], under the surface of one of the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]]. For [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] of Roshar, it's the main method of travelling between Roshar and its subastral, [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. Most recently, it has been besieged by the [[Fused\|Fused]].
**Honor**: [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]] is well-known among worldhoppers and [[Spren\|spren]] to be unstable and dangerous. The exact pattern of its appearance is uncertain, although [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] manages to open it upon swearing the Third Ideal of the [[Bondsmiths\|Bondsmiths]]. The perpendicularity closes on its own within a few minutes.
The [[Surge\|Surge]] of [[Transportation\|Transportation]] temporarily creates a miniature perpendicularity, allowing an [[Elsecaller\|Elsecaller]] or [[Willshaper\|Willshaper]] to travel into Shadesmar from anywhere. However, returning back to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] presents a far greater challenge, and can only be performed in some places. It is unclear if this allows travel to the Spiritual Realm.

**Endowment**: The location of [[Endowment\|Endowment's]] perpendicularity is unspecified. It is, however, located somewhere in the jungles of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. The [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] owe their existence and their unusual properties as dye material to soaking up the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] flowing up from the perpendicularity. There are enough cosmere-aware people on Nalthis for there to be customs at this perpendicularity.

There is something similar to a perpendicularity on Yolen, despite the lack of a Shard.
