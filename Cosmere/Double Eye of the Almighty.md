>“*Ten spheres connected by lines forming a shape like an hourglass on its side. Two of the spheres at the center looked almost like pupils. The Double Eye of the Almighty.*”
\-Shallan's thoughts upon seeing an image of the Double Eye of the Almighty[1]


The **Double Eye of the Almighty** (sometimes shortened to **Double Eye**) is a traditional [[Vorinism\|Vorin]] symbol, about as old as Vorinism itself, that represents the creation of life on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and is also closely associated with [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] and the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].

## Design
The core of the Double Eye of the Almighty is a set of ten circles (often thought of as "spheres") representing the [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]] along with lines connecting them. The Essences are ordered in a loop such that any two adjacent Essences correspond to orders of the Knights Radiant that share a [[Surge\|Surge]]. Adjacent Essences in the sequence are connected by lines, as are opposite ones. There are also additional lines connecting Talus to Blood and Air to Lucentia.
The name "Double Eye" comes from the particular placement of the Essences: Pulp and Sinew are placed close to the center of the shape, evoking two pupils in an eye formed by the remaining Essences.
In some depictions, smaller circles representing the ten [[Surge\|Surges]] are also included, placed in a circle interleaved with the Essences. Each Surge is connected to the two adjacent ones and to the Essences corresponding to the two Radiant orders that have access to that Surge.

## Significance
>“*The preceding list is an imperfect gathering of traditional Vorin symbolism associated with the Ten Essences. Bound together, these form the Double Eye of the Almighty, an eye with two pupils representing the creation of plants and creatures. This is also the basis for the hourglass shape that was often associated with the Knights Radiant.*”
\-Khriss's summary of the Ten Essences and the Double Eye[2]

According to [[Khriss\|Khriss]], the Double Eye represents the creation of plants and animals on Roshar, though exactly what that means is not clear. In modern Vorin belief, while the Double Eye doesn't seem to be actively used in worship, it is at least somewhat revered; the [[Devotary\|Devotary]] of Purity, for instance, considers images of the Double Eye to be suitable for [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to draw.
The ten main circles in the Double Eye are primarily representative of the Ten Essences, but, perhaps because of the association between the Essences and the ten orders of Knights Radiant, the Double Eye is also often used as an icon to represent the Knights Radiant. One prominent version of the Double Eye that is particularly closely associated with them depicts a pair of [[Larkin\|larkin]] in the background, suggesting a connection between larkin and the Knights.
Although the Double Eye does neatly describe the different orders and the Surges they can access, it is, to a large extent, a philosophical and cultural construct rather than an exact reflection of the laws of Surgebinding.
Due to Rosharan belief in the Double Eye and its association with the Almighty, if [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]] were to manifest on Roshar, he would appear with double pupils, even though he did not have them previously.
