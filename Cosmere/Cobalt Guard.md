## History
### Post: Battle of the Tower
After the betrayal at the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], The Cobalt Guard was nearly wiped out. After bolstering their numbers with the members of Bridge 4, Dalinar augmented the King's Guard with the remaining men of the Cobalt Guard to secure King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] life. Dalinar took the men from [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] as his new bodyguards. He gave his cloak to Kaladin to show that he was the new head of his personal guard.
The remaining members of the Cobalt Guard accepted [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] as their leader without a word of complaint. Shortly after Kaladin becoming Captain of the Cobalt Guard, a few remaining original members, all darkeyed, had started eating meals with [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] and requested to have the new Bridge Four patches, but were ordered to keep their original patches on at least one shoulder, as a mark of pride.
Even with the added numbers from the leftover members of the original Cobalt Guard, Kaladin felt as if he did not have enough men to adequately guard the members of the Kholin family.

### Battle in Emul
The Cobalt Guard defended [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] during the battle in [[Emul\|Emul]]. This group, along with [[Cord\|Cord]] fended off an attack from [[Nale\|Nale]] and the [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]]. They were later used to create a perimeter around [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] tent after the duel between [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] and [[Ruthar\|Ruthar]].
