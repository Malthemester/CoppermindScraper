## Appearance and Personality
 by  Shuravf 
>“*You have to hate me! Hate me, please.*”
\-Shalash to Taln[8]


For more images, see [[Shalash/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Shalash has dark skin and long black hair. Her eyes are a faint violet, so faint as to be almost white, and lack epicanthic folds. She is also described as being tall and lean as well as exceptionally beautiful. In recent years, she tends to wear practical clothing over anything particularly feminine. She carries around a thin-bladed sword, though it's not a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
She dislikes thievery, though she has no issues with breaking into the dwellings of the rich to destroy art, even if she doesn't want the destruction to be too easy. This appears to be a perversion of her divine attribute of Creative, and may be a symptom of her forsaking of the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. It's focused on depictions of herself - whenever she sees her own face, whether as a painting, statue or tapestry, she is compelled to destroy it. She seems unable to resist the urge even when pressed for time. She is, however, aware of this, and when doing something important, she actively avoids looking anywhere one may find artwork of the Heralds.
Shalash is very private and does not appreciate being asked prying questions. She seems to be highly regretful of abandoning the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. Upon meeting [[Taln\|Taln]] again, she's extremely apologetic for leaving him behind, and expresses dismay that he doesn't hate her for it. Despite that, she no longer cares about the fate of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and its people. She also seems to have periods of losing touch with reality, as she mentions missing decades, if not centuries of memories.

For more information about Heralds' powers, see Herald#Abilities.
### Immortality
Shalash is a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] capable of returning to life, though the exact mechanics of how are unclear. Following every death, she travels to [[Braize\|Braize]]; whenever she or another Herald give in, she returns to life on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. While alive, she's ageless, and will likely live forever unless killed. She also appears to have no need of sleep; at the very least, it seems she cannot easily lose consciousness.

### Surgebinding
As part of the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], she was given one of the [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]], granting her access to [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]]. Her Blade allowed her to use the [[Surge\|Surges]] of Illumination, or creating illusions, and Transformation, or [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]]. However, she has left her Blade behind at the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], and hasn't recovered it since.

### Other
Considering her well-known attributes, it's likely Shalash was once an artist of some sort, or at least artistically inclined. Her hearing is noted as exceptionally good. She's also fairly capable of spying and infiltration, as she has no problems mixing herself into a new city or finding her way into a military camp. Though her obsession with depictions of herself is compulsive, she is very covert about it, breaking into houses and leaving without any trace of her presence other than missing or destroyed art.

## History
### Heraldic Epochs
Unlike with the other Heralds, it's uncertain whether Shalash was born on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] or after its people travelled to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], though the former is more likely. When the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] started, she was chosen by [[Honor\|Honor]] to be one of his Heralds. This formed the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], which included Shalash receiving one of the [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]] to aid her in her duties. The precise circumstances of how this came to be are unknown, but there are stories about [[Proving Day\|Proving Day]], during which the would-be Heralds faced difficult, if not impossible, tasks to prove themselves.
Following the formation of the Oathpact, Shalash and the other Heralds spent several thousand years helping the people of Roshar fight the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] in subsequent Desolations. Preceding each Desolation, the Heralds would return to Roshar and have a short time to prepare them for said Desolation, teaching them any necessary technology they may have lost in the intervening time. The level of technology the Heralds returned to varied with each Desolation, in some cases the Rosharans had not progressed past the Stone Age. At the end of each Desolation, if Shalash did not "die", she, along with any other surviving Heralds, was required to leave Roshar and return to [[Braize\|Braize]]. There, she and the others would be tortured to get them to give in and return, whereupon a new Desolation would begin.
At [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], Shalash and all Heralds other than [[Taln\|Taln]] -- who was dead at the time -- decided to forsake the Oathpact and abandon their Honorblades. They lied to the people of Roshar, telling them they had "won" and went their separate ways. They were, however, not as successful in their breaking as they'd thought.

### Era of Solitude
>“*I'm worried about Ash. She’s getting worse.*”
\-Kalak [20]


Roughly four and a half thousand years after Aharietiam, Shalash was traveling the world destroying any depictions of herself. Sometime prior to the assassination of King [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] she infiltrated the royal palace in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] and destroyed her own statue. This pattern of behavior seemed to have gotten much worse at the time, as her fellow Heralds noted that she was getting worse.
Five years later, in 1173, Shalash, alongside with hired help [[Baxil\|Baxil]] and [[Av\|Av]], infiltrated the palace of [[Ashno\|Ashno of Sages]], the Prime of [[Emul\|Emul]], and destroyed a great deal of artwork depicting herself, including a canvas painting and a statue. Either during or prior to that time, she also infiltrated the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] in [[Azimir\|Azimir]], where she defaced the mural of the Heralds, scratching out her own face, along with destroying many of the statues in her temple in [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]].

### True Desolation
Following the [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] civil war, at the start of the True Desolation, Ash became a washerwoman under the assumed name Pom to track down a painting of herself by [[Dandos\|Dandos]] Oilsworn. This turned out to be a trap set up by [[Mraize\|Mraize]], who wished to tell her where [[Taln\|Taln]] was. This set her on the path to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], where she arrived just in time for the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. There, she found Taln.
During the battle, Taln was next to catatonic, requiring Ash to pull him along until [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] managed to open [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]], whereupon the two Heralds managed to have a short conversation. After the battle, with Taln once more uncommunicative, Ash decided to take him to [[Ishar\|Ishar]]. This was, however, not to be, as at the same time, [[Vyre\|Vyre]] managed to kill [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]], sending her into deep shock. The resulting commotion made [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], watching the line to the [[Oathgates\|Oathgates]], notice them and come to confront them, but Shalash fell unconscious before the two could talk.
After being discovered at the Battle of Thaylen Field, Ash and Taln moved to Urithiru, where they were often interviewed by Jasnah. Ash provided some information about [[Bondsmiths\|Bondsmiths]] and the Oathpact to Dalinar, but claimed that Ishar was the real expert on the subject. The two Heralds were brought along to the offensive in Emul, and Ash was eventually again questioned by Dalinar about Ishar.

## Relationships
Shalash is the daughter of [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]], a fellow Herald. It doesn't seem as though the two are very close; the only time she's seen thinking about him is when she feels the pain of his death. Other Heralds -- [[Nale\|Nale]] and possibly [[Kalak\|Kalak]] -- appear to have been keeping tabs on her activities, though it's unknown whether they've met with her directly in recent years.
She and [[Taln\|Taln]] were likely romantically involved, or at least very close; she finds herself drawn to his hands, and remembers the sensation of them even after four thousand years. He's also the only person to whom she's apologetic about abandoning the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], and she nearly breaks down when he refuses to hate her for it.
She has met [[Hoid\|Hoid]], and knows him well enough to be able to recognize his art style, though she refers to him as Midius.

## Culture

>“*Ash's eyes!*”
\-Shallan[25]


In [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], Shalash is known as **Shalash'Elin**, the Herald of Beauty, though the nickname Ash is also used. Tradition associates her with the number 6 (shash), the [[Ten Essences\|Essence]] of Blood, and the divine attributes of Creative and Honest. Like all other Heralds, she has temples to herself in all major cities. There are numerous pieces of artwork devoted to her, and depictions of her can be found decorating even utilitarian items like braziers.
"Ash's eyes" is an extremely common phrase, often used to express shock or surprise. "Shalashian temperament" is an idiom with uncertain meaning, though it may refer to being honest or impulsive. The name [[Shallan\|Shallan]] is derived from Shalash.
Further west, in [[Emul\|Emul]] and, likely, other [[Makabak\|Makabaki]] countries, Shalash is known as **Epan** and titled the **Lady of Dreams**. In [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], she is called **Shush-daughter-God**.

## Trivia
Shalash is currently planned to be one of the focus characters in the "back five" books of *The Stormlight Archive*.
She's one of only three Heralds, alongside [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and [[Pailiah\|Pailiah]], whose names are naturally symmetric under [[Vorin\|Vorin]] rules. 
"Shalash" bears a certain resemblance to [[Aon\|Aons]] Shao (Transformation), Ala (Beauty), and Ashe (Light). While this isn't coincidental, Shalash herself may be unaware of the linguistics of her name.
Her name and [[Shashara\|Shashara's]] are similar, but this isn't significant.
Shalash's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the Artist by the [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] staff.
