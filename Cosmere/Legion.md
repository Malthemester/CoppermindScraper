## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[Legion/Summary\|/Summary]].
Legion is a modern-day thriller/mystery with some science fiction undertones.

>“*Stephen Leeds is perfectly sane. It's his hallucinations who are mad.A genius of unrivaled aptitude, Stephen can learn any new skill, vocation, or art in a matter of hours. However, to contain all of this, his mind creates hallucinatory people—Stephen calls them aspects—to hold and manifest the information. Wherever he goes, he is joined by a team of imaginary experts to give advice, interpretation, and explanation. He uses them to solve problems...for a price.His brain is getting a little crowded, however, and the aspects tend to take on lives of their own. When a company hires him to recover stolen property--a camera that can allegedly take pictures of the past—Stephen finds himself in an adventure crossing oceans and fighting terrorists. What he discovers may upend the foundation of three major world religions—and, perhaps, give him a vital clue into the true nature of his aspects.*”

## Setting
Legion is set in an alternative universe Earth which seems to be equivalent to ours up to the 21st century. There seems to be the possibility of some secret/shady supernatural investment in however Stephen Leeds's powers work, and there are some alterations to history given how famous and influential Steven has become. There also seems to be developments of technology which have not had parallels in our world such as a camera that can take pictures of the past developed [[Azari Laboratories, Inc\|Azari Laboratories, Inc]].
