Brightness **Tanalan** is the highlady of [[Rathalas\|Rathalas]] in southern [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
In 1141, [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] forces attacked Rathalas as part of his war for the unification of Alethkar. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] dueled Brightness Tanalan's husband, [[Tanalan's father\|Brightlord Tanalan]], fatally wounding him. Tanalan's soldiers tried to hide him in a secret room, but Dalinar quickly found it. However, when Dalinar entered the room, he found Brightness Tanalan draped over her dying husband's body along with their young son, also named [[Tanalan\|Tanalan]]. The younger Tanalan pleaded with Dalinar while attempting to wield his father's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)\|Oathbringer]] and the [[Thrill\|Thrill]] quickly left Dalinar. He took the Shardblade but he spared Brightness Tanalan and her son despite having orders to kill the child. Her subsequent fate is unknown, but none of the residents of Rathalas survived its complete destruction in 1163.
