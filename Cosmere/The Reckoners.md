## Trivia
Brandon initially planned another series in the same universe, *The Apocalypse Guard*, about a group that works to save planets from mass extinctions. The first book, however, didn't work, and Brandon is currently working on revising with the help of his friend and author [[Dan Wells\|Dan Wells]]. He has not fully ruled out a connection to the Reckoners universe, but it is not a priority.
