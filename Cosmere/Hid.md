## History
Hid met Kaladin as a member of Noro's squad during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]. He was present during the [[Fused\|Fused]] raids on the city wall, and was admonished by Noro to stay in formation with his shield during the attacks. Hid was presumably present with the rest of the squad when Kaladin revealed his ability to draw in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and when Highmarshal [[Azure\|Azure]] revealed how she supplied food for the army.
