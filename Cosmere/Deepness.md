**The Deepness** was considered an evil blight on the world of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] prior to the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]]. In reality, it was the mist banks, created by [[Preservation\|Preservation]], used to [[Snap\|Snap]] the people of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] in anticipation of [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] release.

## Pre-Ascension
During the time before the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], when the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] was about to become full, [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] influence in the world increased. Instead of trying to destroy the [[Mist\|mists]], like [[Preservation\|Preservation]] had predicted he would, he encouraged the [[Mist\|mists]] to cover the land during the day, blocking off sunlight and causing plant life to die off. The mists also started attacking people, which was [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] way of [[Snapping\|Snapping]] potential [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]], although some people died in the process. With crops unable to grow and the mists apparently killing people directly, the people of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] interpreted the [[Mist\|mists]] as a threat, one which could not be fought with traditional means. This phenomenon became known as the Deepness.
When [[Rashek\|Rashek]] harnessed the power of the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], he moved the planet closer to the sun in an attempt to burn the Deepness off. This caused unlivable global warming. In another attempt to fix this, Rashek created the [[Ashmounts\|ashmounts]], volcanoes that spewed ash and cooled the air. Again, this caused problems. He finally "solved" the problem by granting living beings the ability to inhale ash.

## Post-Ascension
The mists returned to normal soon after, only coming out at night and remaining harmless. After many years, details of what happened became lost to history as Rashek's new role as the **Lord Ruler** was solidified and his original identity hidden. The [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]] depicted the Deepness as a formless enemy that the Lord Ruler defeated prior to his Ascension. Few people knew that the Deepness was the same as the nightly mists, although many [[Skaa\|Skaa]] still fear to go out at night because of frightening stories told from generation to generation about how the mists could steal people's souls. Most nobles, particularly [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]] and especially [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], were unafraid of the mists.
After [[Ruin\|Ruin]] was released from his prison, he once again made the mists remain during the day. This caused the same problems it once did, making people realize what the Deepness actually was.
