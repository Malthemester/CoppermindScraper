## The Hushlands
For more information, see .
The Hushlands or Libraria consists of all the landmasses of the *real* world. They are under control of the [[Librarian\|Librarians]] Someone who lives there is called a 'Hushlander'.
A notably absent area of land is where France resides, likely a reference to Alcatraz’s repeated references to France (and french things, such as Napoleon) being “fantasy” This does raise the question of where Kaz and the crew ended up during the travel montage in The Scriveners Bones.

## The Free Kingdoms
 by  Isaac Stewart  
The Free Kingdoms consist of three continents which fill up a large amount of the Hushlanders Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
The Atlantic ocean has two major landmasses, one in the northern ocean the other in the southern, separated by a line of large islands forming the nation of Anokaba. The northern continent is shared between three nations, roughly split by mountain ranges. The northern nation is Fooster, whose territory also includes a string of small islands from its coast up to the southern tip of . Ulfheim borders to the south, and has a small sea between its eastern tip and the north-western tip of . The western nation of Fracois shares a sea border with the northern-most islands of Anokaba, and its western tip is close to the .

## History
The [[Incarna\|Incarna]] were a people with a large knowledge of [[Silimatic\|Silimatics]]. They created the [[Smedry Talent\|Smedry Talents]] using some unknown method. They fell due to something related to the Talents. [[Allekatrase\|Alcatraz the First]] broke his people's language to prevent anyone from using the knowledge for destruction.
The [[Librarian\|Librarians]] were created when [[Biblioden\|Biblioden]] taught that the world was too strange and dangerous for most people to know about. This started the mass censorship and alteration of history that continues in the Hushlands. The Librarians control all knowledge in the Hushlands. Any time the Librarians take over a new territory, it is added to the Hushlands. History books are changed so it appears that the new territory was always part of Hushland history. The most recent Librarian acquisition is the continent of Australia.
