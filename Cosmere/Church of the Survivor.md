The **Church of the Survivor** (later **Survivorism**) is a religion on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] founded during the fall of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] and the ascension of [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. Their symbol is a wooden spear painted silver.
The religion is based upon the exploits of [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], the Survivor of Hathsin. Some of the "miracles" alleged by faithful members of the religion were actually trickery using [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and later using a [[Kandra\|kandra]]. These "miracles" were part of Kelsier's master plan to upset the balance of power in the Final Empire. The religion was taken up mostly by [[Skaa\|skaa]] with prominent figures such as [[Demoux\|Demoux]] and also [[Elend\|Elend]], who joined the Church to further his position with the skaa. During the events in [[Urteau\|Urteau]], the heavy influence of the Church led to the rise of the Survivor of Flames, [[Spook\|Spook]].
It eventually evolved into the modern Scadrian religion of **Survivorism**. Survivorism also calls Kelsier The Lord of the Mists, teaching that Kelsier will appear on misty nights and bless the independent. Followers of Survivorism are considered anyone who survives on their own, or thinks for themselves.
Additional figures in the religion include [[Vin\|Vin]], who was originally known as The Heir of the Survivor and is now known as The Ascendant Warrior, and Sazed (Harmony), named "Holy First Witness" by early members of the church. Another figure, The Lord Mistborn, is Spook, who was made a Mistborn by Sazed (Harmony) after the world was reborn and asked to look after humanity.
After Sazed ascended to become Harmony, he left a book detailing the events leading up to the rebirth of the world including the Hero of Ages prophecy. He also left books that contained all of the knowledge contained in his [[Coppermind\|Copperminds]]. These become known as The [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]].
The [[Pathism\|Pathians]] and Survivorists both use these books. Despite this, the Survivorists dislike those who follow the Path, but the feeling isn't reciprocated.
Survivorism followers around 340 [[Catacendre\|PC]] include [[Father Bin\|Father Bin]], [[Steris\|Steris]], [[Marasi\|Marasi]], [[Allomancer Jak\|Allomancer Jak]], and [[Clamps\|Clamps]]. [[Miles\|Miles]] was a follower until he converted to [[Trellism\|Trellism]].

## Doctrine
Survivorism is very conservative and forbid homosexuality, a holdover from when repopulating the Basin was the prime concern of most people.
