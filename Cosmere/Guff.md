**Guff** is a bad-mouthed  and caravaneer on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Guff is an older man who is half a reed tall and has some sort of injury that affects his walking and movement. It is likely that he has an accent that is associated with the caravaneers.
He was an old friend of [[Moash\|Moash's]] from before the younger man traveled to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Moash found Guff again in [[Revolar\|Revolar]] after the city had been conquered by the [[Singers\|singers]]. Guff had taken up employment as a guard for the local [[Brightlord\|Brightlord]], [[Paladar\|Paladar]]. He was tasked with keeping people out of the Brightlord's tents and also alerting Paladar to any soldiers who were captured. He was surprised to see Moash, as he had assumed the other man to be dead.
Finding out that Moash had at some point been a soldier, Guff took him to see Paladar, however, Moash's silence when asked questions by the Brightlord led to Guff being beaten and replaced.
