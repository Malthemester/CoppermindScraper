## Appearance and Personality
Like many of the Returned gods, Lifeblesser is nearly seven feet tall, with sculpted muscles and a square jaw. His defining features are his brown hair and flowing robes. His colors are blue and silver, and he typically wears robes in these colors. He is honest, but not particularly intelligent, and tends to blurt out his unedited thoughts. He therefore has difficulty with the nuances of politicking with his fellow Returned.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a [[Returned\|Returned]], Lifeblesser has a [[Divine Breath\|Divine Breath]] which gives him the benefits of being on the [[Fifth Heightening\|Fifth Heightening]]. This includes:

Aura Recognition - allows him to assess the number of Breaths a person possesses.
Perfect Pitch
Perfect Color Recognition - allows him to instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics.
Perfect Life Sense - allows him to sense people around him.
Agelessness - makes him immune to most toxins and physical ailments, as well as making him functionally immortal.
## History
He was present at [[Siri\|Siri's]] presentation in the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]].
He played [[Tarachin\|Tarachin]] with [[Weatherlove\|Weatherlove]] and [[Truthcall\|Truthcall]] every week and tried to use the time as an opportunity to make political advances. According to [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]], this was the true purpose, and the true game, for Lifeblesser and his companions. However, Lifeblesser often missed the subtext of these conversations, and was also confused by Lightsong's humor when he would join the game. He bluntly expressed his belief that [[Siri\|Siri]] was faking her inexperience, and suggested attacking her homeland of [[Idris\|Idris]] as retaliation for King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] sending his youngest daughter instead of the older one, [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]].

## Relationships
He is friends with Lightsong, Weatherlove, and Truthcall since they get together for a game of Tarachin every week, although all of them sometimes find his bluntness cringe-worthy.
