## Appearance and Personality
Tyden exhibits extreme disdain for [[Skaa\|skaa]], and [[Vin\|Vin]] believes that he would likely abuse or kill them without remorse. He is not very clever, and Vin thinks his sense of humor would have fit in better with [[Camon's crew\|Camon's crew]] than it does with the nobility.

## History
During a ball at [[Keep Hasting\|Keep Hasting]], he was part of a conversation with Vin, [[Kliss\|Kliss]], [[Milen Davenpleu\|Milen Davenpleu]], and other nobles about recent events in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. He contributed little, other than a poorly-received joke about [[Ardous Geffenry\|Ardous Geffenry's]] death. He became quite upset when Kliss mentioned local skaa thieving activity. His wife [[Carlee\|Carlee]] implied that his incompetence led him to be scammed by a thieving crew, perhaps explaining his extreme anger towards them.

## Relationships
Carlee, who is relatively young, often publicly mocks him for his mistakes. He took part in a regular [[Shelldry\|shelldry]] group with Milen, [[Rene\|Rene]], and another noble.
