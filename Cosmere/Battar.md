For more information about Heralds' powers, see Herald#Abilities.
Battar is an immortal [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] who gains a [[Physical Realm\|physical]] body upon each return to Roshar. After death, she is transported to [[Braize\|Braize]] to be tortured; when she or another Herald breaks, a new Desolation begins.
During the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], she wielded an [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]]. It granted her access to the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Transformation\|Transformation]], which enables her to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]], and [[Transportation\|Transportation]], which allows for travel to and from [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. She has, however, abandoned it at [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]].
She seems to be fairly knowledgeable, being ascribed the attribute of Wise, and noticing signs of an upcoming Desolation years before the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]].

## History
 by  mushimallo 
Battar was born on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] and escaped to [[Roshar\|Roshar]] when her homeworld was destroyed in a [[Surge\|Surge]]-induced catastrophe. She was a figure of some importance during that time, and when the [[Fused\|Fused]] began to appear, she was made a [[Herald\|Herald]] by [[Honor\|Honor]]. Thence she participated in every Desolation, and between Desolations, she would travel to [[Braize\|Braize]], when she'd be captured and tortured by the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] to get at least one Herald to break and start a new Desolation.
Eventually, she and the other Heralds grew exhausted with this endless cycle of war and torture. When [[Ishar\|Ishar]] suggested that one person might be enough to hold the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], she and the others abandoned [[Taln\|Taln]] to his fate, leaving their [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]] behind. From then on out, they hid among the human populace. Most of her actions in the intervening four and a half millennia are unknown.
As Dova, she supposedly approached [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] and warned him of a coming [[Desolation\|Desolation]], which prompted him to seek out [[Szeth\|Szeth]] after King [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] assassination. She has since been assisting the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]]. Sometime prior to Taravangian seizing of the throne of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], she reported that the frequency of [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattles]] had been declining further, hinting at [[Moelach\|Moelach's]] movement. She was later assigned with writing an anonymous essay revealing [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] decision to make the former a highking, to undermine Dalinar's authority along with the revelations of the translated [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]]. With the fulfillment of the Diagram Taravangian instructed his followers to no longer trust Battar as he feared for her mental state after seeing the other Heralds.

Battar has been worshipped since the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch, with people swearing by her name even in-between the [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. In the modern [[Vorin\|Vorin]] tradition, she's known as **Battah'Elin**, and is associated with the number seven (Betab), the [[Ten Essences\|Essence]] of Tallew, the [[Polestone\|gemstone]] Zircon, and the attributes Wise and Careful.
There is a temple to her in several major Vorin cities. The temple of Battah in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] is particularly notable -- it is the oldest in the city, and a must-see location for every arriving dignitary.

## Trivia
Battar's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the Counselor by the [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] staff.
Battar is the only [[Herald\|Herald]] to not yet have an official depiction.
