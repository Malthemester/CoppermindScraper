## Appearance and Personality
He is well dressed, and wears a stiff white shirt, a cravat, and diamond cufflinks. The diamonds are set in wood, presumably to keep the cufflinks Allomantically inert.
He is not scrupulous, and openly sold his senate vote to the highest bidder. He was cynical and materialistic, believing that the historical events around the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]] were "fanciful legends" and that a fear of the [[Mist\|mists]] is "superstitious nonsense". He is a careful person, and his mansion contains a saferoom. He sometimes uses his [[Rioter\|Rioting]] abilities even when it is not necessary, and employs a [[Seeker\|Seeker]] named [[Blome\|Blome]] to ensure that other people do not use Allomancy around him.

## Attributes and Abilities
Innate is an [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]], a [[Zinc\|zinc]] [[Misting\|Misting]] known as a [[Rioter\|Rioter]]. He can manipulate people's emotions. He is presumably wealthy, as he owns a well-appointed mansion in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] that was his primary residence and he wears expensive clothing. He takes his security very seriously; he employs multiple bodyguards and at least one Allomancer for protection.
He is a painter, and believes that he is getting better, although he is still not very skilled.
He knows several crime lords, and is aware that [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]] uses the alias "Mister Suit".

## History
Winsting Innate became a senator when his brother Replar won the governorship. Most people were not aware of his Allomantic abilities. The constabulary knew that he was corrupt, but he was afforded protection by his brother and the general popularity of his family. He had mostly pulled off small-time schemes, and Captain [[Aradel\|Aradel]] and others did not think he was worth their time. Replar helped cover up Winsting's crimes, and also may have assigned him to some politically popular tasks to try and boost his reputation.

### Auction and Murder
For more information, see [[Winsting Innate's auction\|Winsting Innate's auction]].
During an [[Winsting Innate's auction\|auction]] at his mansion where he attempted to sell his vote to other House leaders and underworld figures, the party was attacked by [[Paalm\|Paalm]]. Paalm used [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] [[Steel\|steel]] to move around the ballroom at superhuman speed while firing her weapon, causing people to think that the shots were coming from rival attendees; a large firefight broke out and everyone in the ballroom was killed. Winsting fled to his saferoom. One of his bodyguards, [[Flog\|Flog]], entered, but it was actually Paalm in disguise. Paalm slit Winsting's throat, then cut out his tongue, symbolically indicating her plan to silence [[Harmony\|Harmony's]] supposed lies. She then killed the rest of the guards to cover her tracks.
Winsting's death was reported on in a rather sensationalistic manner by the Elendel broadsheets; the many criminal elements revealed to be present at the party raised concerns about government corruption. [[Wax\|Wax]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]], and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] investigated the murder, setting them on a path that eventually led them to Paalm.
