\-Spensa's mother on bravery[1]


**Spensa's mother** is a food saleswoman. She lives in [[Igneous Cavern\|Igneous Cavern]] along with her daughter and her mother-in-law, [[Becca Nightshade\|Becca Nightshade]].

## Appearance and Personality
Spensa's mother is a tall, lean woman with shoulder length hair. She wears an old, worn jumpsuit.
As the wife of the "The Coward of Alta," Spensa's mother is looked down on by her fellow Defiants. After [[Zeen Nightshade\|Zeen]] was portrayed as a deserter by the [[DDF\|DDF]] she was offered a big apartment and a cushy job, if she went along with the DDF's story. She refused this offer and began selling food to workers in the Igneous Caverns, therefore showing herself to be a proud woman.
