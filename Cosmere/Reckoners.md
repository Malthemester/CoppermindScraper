This article is about the group of characters.Â For the series of books, see [[The Reckoners\|The Reckoners]].
The **Reckoners** are a group of freedom fighters on [[Earth (Reckoners)\|Earth]]. They fight the tyranny of the [[Epic\|Epics]].
Founded and lead by [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Jonathan Phaedrus]](also known as Prof), they seek to neutralise as many high-profile Epics as they can. They employ stealth, trickery, and careful planning to overcome their vastly more powerful opponents. They explicitly avoid labeling themselves as revolutionaries; their goal is simply to bring retribution upon the worst Epics, not to rule in their place. They use advanced technology (as well as epic-based ones) and meticulous planning to take down Epics. They are also responsible for freeing the cities of [[Newcago\|Newcago]], [[Babilar\|Babilar]], and [[Ildithia\|Ildithia]].
They operate as many "cells", while the core cell lead by Prof does the killing, the other cells mainly provides information and assists with the scouting or logistics. The lesser cells are mostly kept secret from the epic-based technologies they use. In case people in any cell get captured, Prof keeps all information about the other cells secret.
At various times, the Reckoners have been active in the [[Fractured States\|Fractured States]], Canada, and Mexico.
