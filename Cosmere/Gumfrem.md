**Gumfrems** are domesticated animals on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They are described as pasture animals that are similar to [[Chull\|chulls]], although gumfrems are relatively uncommon. They are raised in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] for their [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]], presumably heliodors, which are small but can be used to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] meat.
Gumfrem farms existed in the [[Akanny\|Akanny]] region of the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]]. Enough gumfrems to clog multiple rooms were taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
