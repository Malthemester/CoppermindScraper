**Margel** is a [[Skaa\|skaa]] woman from the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. She is the mother of [[Spook\|Spook]] and the sister of [[Cladent\|Clubs]].

## History
Margel lived with a young Spook and other skaa in a dirty shack. Spook often ducked out of the house to run around with the other skaa children, learning [[High Imperial\|eastern street slang]] in the process. Margel's husband, [[Jedal\|Jedal]], blamed her for Spook's lack of discipline.
Spook [[Snapping\|Snapped]] when he was only five years old. Margel presumably soon discovered that he was a tin [[Misting\|Misting]]; Allomancy was known to run in their family. She sent for her brother, Clubs, in the hopes that he would take the boy so that he would not be killed due to the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] stringent laws against skaa Allomancy. Clubs used forbidden routes and spent a significant sum to travel to Margel's home from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. By the time Clubs arrived, other skaa (including Jedal) had learned that Spook was a Misting and were prepared to kill him to avoid the wrath of the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]]. Clubs offered Jedal money in return for taking Spook; Jedal was angry with Margel, but she convinced him to accept the offer, and Spook left the family forever. Margel was not a good mother to Spook, but she felt that this was the most she could do for him.
