**Mercy** is a [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] that has not been Splintered and whose Vessel is unknown.
Mercy was involved in a battle between [[Odium\|Odium]] and [[Ambition\|Ambition]], which resulted in a wound in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] and had profound effects on the planet [[Threnody\|Threnody]]. This is likely the battle in which Ambition was Splintered. Some time around the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], [[Harmony\|Harmony]] reached out to Mercy about the threat posed by Odium, but became troubled by Mercy as a result of their exchange.

## Trivia
Before [[Aona\|Aona's]] Shard was known (and well before it was known that Mercy is a Shard), fans speculated its Intent might be Mercy. It was later revealed Aona's Shard is Devotion.
