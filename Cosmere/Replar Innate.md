**Replar Innate** was the corrupt Governor of [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. At some point before the events of [[Shadows of Self\|Shadows of Self]], he was murdered by the [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[Paalm\|Paalm]] and impersonated by her. Paalm used his noble likeness to sow unrest in the city's working class. When his brother [[Winsting Innate\|Winsting Innate]], a member of the Elendel senate, was killed in his own mansion by [[Paalm\|Paalm]], riots broke out in the already-tense streets of Elendel.
During the hunt for Paalm, [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] forced her to abandon Innate's bones. [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] then took his bones and attempted to quell the riots in a speech in front of the Governor's Mansion. During the speech constable [[Claude Aradel\|Claude Aradel]] placed the impersonated Innate under arrest for corruption. MeLaan then staged a suicide of Innate while in jail.
Innate was succeeded by [[Aradel\|Aradel]] as Elendel Governor.
