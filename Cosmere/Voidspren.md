**Voidspren** are spren that, instead of being connected to either [[Honor\|Honor]] or [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], are under [[Odium\|Odium's]] control. They are similar to other types of spren in many ways, such as their ability to bond with things in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] and their various shapes and habits. However, these spren fight on the opposite side of the [[Desolation\|Desolations]], aiding Odium's goal to destroy the [[Rosharan\|Rosharans]] and ultimately earn his freedom from [[Braize\|Braize]]. Once they were entrapped by the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], the Voidspren would torture the [[Herald\|Heralds]] present on Braize in an attempt to get them to bend the bars of [[Damnation\|Damnation]] and release them back to Roshar.

## Bonding
Like the other types of bonding spren, Voidspren can only bond to certain individuals during certain times. For many Voidspren, the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] is needed for the bonding process, likely because of its output of [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]]. The lesser spren that create [[Regal\|Regals]] can bond during highstorms, likely because the Regals can't invest the Voidlight. The bonding process in the previous Desolations is unknown since this is the first Desolation when Odium summoned the Everstorm.
Some Voidspren, like [[Ulim\|Ulim]], are able to bond with a singer without changing their form, residing in their gemheart while leaving the other spren there. The Voidspren can leave and return from their gemheart at will, without the need for a highstorm. This will still influence the singer's emotions, though the influence will leave if the Voidspren exits their gemheart. While inside their gemheart, the Voidspren can communicate directly with the singer though their mind and even hear their thoughts.
Some Voidspren are able to enter any animal's gemheart, giving them some influence of control, depending on the animal's intelligence.

## Types
>‚Äú*Hmm... There are many varieties, she says. Some of golden light, others are red shadows. Curious, yes.*‚Äù
\-Pattern, translating for an ashspren, on Voidspren[6]


There are many varieties of Voidspren, and each type, similar to the other bonding spren, serves a different purpose. Some of them can form bonds, and some haven't revealed whether or not they can. [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] has mentioned a type of spren capable of cracking ciphers, but further details about this type of spren are currently unknown.

### Guiding Spren
>‚Äú*That yellow spren isn't any better. Hurry up. Keep moving. She tells us that we're free, then with the very next breath berates us for not obeying quickly enough.*‚Äù
\-Sah on the yellow Voidspren[8]


These spren haven't shown any bonding abilities, and they serve Odium as guides and messengers. One such spren is [[Yixli\|Yixli]]. They appear as glowing yellow, shaped like windspren with eyes like a [[Shin\|Shin]]. In order to put themselves at the height of humans or singers, they stand on a yellow pillar that rises from the ground. When they walk, another pillar will meet any moving foot, keeping them even. These Voidspren are seen guiding the multiple bands of newly made [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] to settlements, cities and, in the case of Kaladin's group, to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. They are able to detect the arrival of an Everstorm before it appears.

### Secretspren
These spren are similar to the above spren in their color, being yellowish-white, but instead of appearing similar to windspren, these look more like "vivid yellow spheres cackling with energy." They are used during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]] to locate any [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] being used in the city. If a fabrial is turned on, these 'screamers' will wail, then start twisting over each other above the area, alerting a quickly-following [[Fused\|Fused]]. The screamers can also sense when a [[Lashing\|Lashing]] is used, but not when a Lightweaving is created. [[Pattern\|Pattern]] explains that he and [[Shallan\|Shallan]] are quieter than [[Syl\|Syl]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. They can detect Stoneshaping, but not a Willshaper looking into Shadesmar. They cannot detect illusions, as they burn through much less [[Investiture\|Investiture]] than a [[Lashing\|Lashing]], and their senses are fully blocked by aluminum. They could also be blocked by certain [[Aviar\|Aviar]] or Allomantic copper, as they are similar to life sense and Allomantic bronze. These spren are useless within Urithiru, since the whole tower is made of fabrials and thus secretspren would have trouble locating a specific usage of Investiture.

### Chaosspren
Chaosspren are normally invisible, but within Urithiru they leave sparks in the air.

### Stormspren
This type of spren can bond with [[Singer\|singers]] during a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] or the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], granting them [[Regal\|Regal]] power of stormform. The stormspren appear as rolling lightning that moves across surfaces. Despite a similarity in appearance, they are not of the same species as the spren [[Ulim\|Ulim]], who can in addition take on a human appearance.
Stormspren can be found naturally prior to the arrival of [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. Hundreds of stormspren will appear at where a lightning strikes earth, and will linger a short while before disappearing.

### Other Regal spren
Other types of lesser Voidspren are likewise capable of bonding a [[Singer\|singer]] and grant Regal powers. Their appearance and regular behavior are by and large unknown, as they rest in the singer's gemhearts to provide them their powers.
