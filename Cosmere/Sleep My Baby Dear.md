## Lyrics
>“*Now go to sleep in chasms deep, with darkness all around you*
\-Though rock and dread may be your bed, so sleep my baby dear
Now comes the storm, but you’ll be warm, the wind will rock your basket
The crystals fine will glow sublime, so sleep my baby dear
And with a song, it won’t be long, you’ll sleep my baby dear
