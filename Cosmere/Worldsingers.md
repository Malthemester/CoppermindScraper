>“*I am not a foolish jester or storyteller. I do not 'give tales.' I spread knowledge of cultures, peoples, thoughts, and dreams. I bring peace through understanding. It is the holy charge my order received from the Heralds themselves.*”
\-Sigzil on the Worldsingers[1]


The **Worldsingers** were an organization of storytellers and knowledge-givers on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]]. They traveled the world learning of other places and cultures and spreading tales of the places they had already been. They saw themselves as superior to traditional storytellers, charged by the Heralds to spread knowledge. They have a presence in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], and [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] thought there might be one at a [[Middlefest\|Middlefest]] fair. There are some ties between Worldsingers and the [[Terris\|Terris]] [[Worldbringers\|Worldbringers]], that may be related to [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
