\-Huio to Lopen[3]

Huio is one of [[Lopen\|Lopen's]] cousins. He is a short, bald, beefy man with thick arms. He is known among Bridge Four for his propensity to visit prostitutes. His lack of fluency in Alethi is a source of embarrassment to him, though he gets a sense of satisfaction and pride out of his cooking skill. He is a curious and scientifically minded person, and has a fondness for taking apart fabrials to experiment with them and better understand how they work, though this frequently results in him breaking the fabrial beyond repair.

## Abilities and Attributes
Huio is a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]], quick to pick up on how to draw in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. This allows him to use Stormlight and access the [[Surge\|Surges]] of Gravitation and Adhesion when in Kaladin's proximity. He is also fairly skilled in field medicine--at least, more so than [[Teft\|Teft]]--and a more than adept cook. After Huio swore the Third Ideal of the Windrunners, his spren [[Caelinora\|Caelinora]] gained the ability to become a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], which can be summoned in the form that he chooses, including a hammer.
Along with [[Rock\|Rock]] and [[Lopen\|Lopen]], Huio is one of the only members of Bridge Four that can swim.

## History
Late in 1173, Lopen brought Huio and another of his cousins, [[Rod\|Rod]], to join Bridge Four. He ended up often being on kitchen duty with [[Rock\|Rock]], requesting the duty more and more as the others became squires. Huio once added a handful of [[Lazbo\|lazbo]] to some [[Shiki\|shiki]] he was stirring for Rock, much to Rock's horror. When Rock tasted it, however, he realized Huio had improved on the original recipe. He even began to ask Huio's advice on some recipes.
Huio also pulled shifts guarding the Kholins with the rest of Bridge Four. He was part of the group that went with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to check on [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] progress helping rebuild the city from the damage from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and to attend a conference with Queen [[Fen\|Fen]] and the other monarchs who had joined their coalition. The soldiers from Bridge Four were with Dalinar in the conference, so they heard the translation of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]]; this demoralized the group enough that they left Dalinar behind and returned to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on their own. When they returned to the Bridge Four barracks, they discovered the aftermath of [[Taravangian\|Taravangian's]] plot to steal back [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]]: Rock and [[Bisig\|Bisig]] were gravely injured, and [[Eth\|Eth]] was dead. Huio, the best at field medicine present, attended to Rock until they could get him to [[Renarin\|Renarin]].
When he began earning a stipend as a Radiant, he sent most of it to his family to help out the poorer cousins, of which a large part went to [[Rod\|Rod's]] family.

### Expedition to Aimia
A few months after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Lopen and Huio were chosen by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to join the Thaylen [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]] aboard the *Wandersail* as they were capable of swimming, and did not yet have their Blades. Huio spent the early portions of the trip assisting the crew with shipboard duties. Because of Huio struggles with Alethi, Lopen frequently pulled his cousin into conversations to translate jokes. Huio tinkered with Rushu's spanreen and the aluminum foil - an activity that ultimately results in the discovery of aluminum-modified [[Fabrial\|fabrials]].
After discovering [[Nikli\|Nikli's]] plot to sabotage the expedition, Lopen and Huio are tasked with flying the porter to shore for incarceration.
At some point during Lopen's absence, Huio began fighting the large hordeling that was attacking the *Wandersail*. Lopen arrived just in time to rescue Huio from its jaws. The two fought the creature to give the crew time to escape. After Lopen's assault fails, and he falls to the ground injured, Huio swore the Third Ideal to save Lopen and summoned [[Caelinora\|Caelinora]] as a Shardhammer to shatter the hordeling's arm. Shortly after, Huio killed it with a Shardspear through the head. The two escape while Rysn's negotiation continues underground.
Back at the ship, Lopen and Huio discussed the Third Ideal. Lopen congratulated his cousin on beating him to the ideal, although struggled to do so as he had an inkling that Huio's oath had been related to him and thought Huio might harbor ill will for him. Huio, however, explained that did not hate Lopen and that the Third Ideal didn't have to involve hatred - although the constant ribbing and teasing from his cousin could be a bit much.
