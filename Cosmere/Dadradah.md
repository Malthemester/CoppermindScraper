>“* They thought art drew one closer to God, they were most interested in color and hue, and they were fond of writing poetry describing the colors they saw in the world around them.*”
\- Sazed preaching to Clubs[1]


**Dadradah** was an ancient religion from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The Dadradah followers were found through many countries and peoples. They believed that there was only one God, and that practicing art was the only right way to worship or draw closer to that God, being an artist even was a higher calling than being a priest. Dadradah followers had a fascination for color and hue, and were fond of poetry that described this.
While preparing for the [[Battle of Luthadel\|Battle of Luthadel]], Sazed proposed the Dadradah religion to [[Clubs\|Clubs]]. He thought this suitable because Clubs's woodworking was also a form of art. Sazed then gave him a simple wooden disk with the carved picture of a brush on it, which was a symbol of the Dadradah faith.
When [[Sazed\|Sazed]] recreated Scadrial during the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]] he was able to restore the plants, sky and landscape to their original state, using Dadradah poems as a guideline.
