**Plamry** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] man on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that worked with [[Nikliasorm\|Nikli]] as a porter to [[Rysn\|Rysn]].

## History
Plamry did not seem to be present when [[Nikliasorm\|Nikli]] first appeared in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and was presumably hired to serve as Nikli's assistant porter shortly before the *Wandersail* departed on the [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]] in 1174.
When Nikli was discovered by Rysn to have been working against the voyage, Plamry was also under suspicion and taken captive by [[Kstled\|Kstled]]. Despite Nikli's insistence that Plamry was not aware of its plan, [[Lopen\|Lopen]] and [[Huio\|Huio]] flew both of them to the main island of [[Aimia\|Aimia]], chained them up, and left them with food and water, so that the *Wandersail* could continue its mission.
Plamry was indeed ignorant of Nikli's true goals and its nature as a [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]]. Nikli presumably used its abilities to escape from Aimia, and Plamry's mental state after seeing hordelings in action is unclear. He was recovered from Aimia after the mission to explore [[Akinah\|Akinah]] had been completed.
