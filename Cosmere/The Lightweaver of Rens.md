**The Lightweaver of Rens** is an unpublished [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] work set on [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. During Brandon's 2007 rewrite of the [[Dragonsteel\|Dragonsteel]] series, he outlined this book as a direct sequel to *The Liar of Partinel* and a prequel to the main Dragonsteel arc. Brandon was ultimately dissatisfied with *Liar*, and so this book was never finished.
Similar to *The Liar of Partinel*, this story is believed to have featured a character named Midius who later becomes [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
