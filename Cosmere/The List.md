**The List** is a list of reasons why short people are better off than tall people according to [[Kazan Smedry\|Kazan Smedry]]. It is not clear if Kaz is serious about The List, but he takes every opportunity to recite from it. [[Australia Smedry\|Australia Smedry]] finds The List ridiculous, as does [[Bastille\|Bastille]]. Kazan says that the facts on The List are scientifically researched and time-tested.

## Known items on The List
**1.** Don't argue with the short person. He's always right.
**15.** Short people make smaller targets.
**28.** Short people can find things easier and follow trails better because they are closer to the ground.
**47.** Tall people's heads are in thinner atmosphere, causing oxygen deprivation, which causes their brains to not work as well as short people's.
**56.5.** Short people know when to stay on the ground (and avoid scary extreme heights).
**63.** If everyone were short, ceilings could be lower, thereby lowering building costs.
**82.** When short people plummet to their doom, they don't fall as far.
**127.** Short people have smaller bodies, but regular-sized hearts, so their heart-to-flesh ratio is larger, making them more compassionate.
**236.** Short people are more humble.
**257.** A tall person can shield you from dragon breath.
Unknown number. Short people are better because it takes them longer to walk places, therefore they get more exercise.
