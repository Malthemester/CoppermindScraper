>“*Akokian pudding! It's a wonderful mixture of sweet and savory!*”
\-Mrs. Chamwit[1]


**Akokian pudding** is a type of food that can be found on [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]].
It's both sweet and savory, and additionally possesses high nutritional value; despite the name suggesting it to be a dessert, it's apparently a good dinner dish. The [[UrDail\|UrDail]] - and possibly humans - are capable of eating and digesting it without issues. As such, [[Mrs. Chamwit\|Mrs. Chamwit]] offers to make it for [[Spensa\|Spensa]] during her stay on the station, and later sends her a small pastry. While Spensa finds the pastry delicious, she never confirms whether it was the Akokian pudding. It's likewise unclear what the name "Akokian" derives from.
