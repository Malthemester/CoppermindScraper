**Varnali** is a [[Listener\|listener]] elder on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and a member of [[The Five\|the Five]], the listener ruling council.

## History
In the days when [[Venli\|Venli]] was first seeking new forms for the listeners, Varnali sat on the council with [[Gangnah\|Gangnah]], [[Klade\|Klade]], and two others. They heard out both [[Eshonai\|Eshonai's]] argument to unify the listeners and Venli's petition to try to adopt warform from the [[Painspren\|painspren]] she had trapped in a topaz. Despite Varnali's feeling that it was a dangerous form, they also thought it would be useful.
Varnali came to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] with other elders and listeners to attend the signing of a treaty with the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] and the accompanying feast. After the listeners arrived, the Alethi king [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] gave Eshonai a [[Black sphere\|black sphere]] and told her that the Five should know of his intent to release their [[Fused\|gods]]. Eshonai reported back to Varnali and the rest of the Five; they were shocked and quickly came to the agreement that Gavilar must be killed in order to prevent his plan. The council ordered their newly purchased [[Truthless\|Truthless]], [[Szeth\|Szeth]], to [[Assassination of Gavilar\|assassinate the king]]. Varnali and the other members of the Five were visibly nervous during the feast celebrating the treaty.
Varnali, Gangnah, and Klade remained behind in the wake of Gavilar's death while their people escaped. The three listeners went to Gavilar's rooms and spoke to Brightlady [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], taking full responsibility for Gavilar's death, but they offered no explanation beyond the fact that they were attempting to avoid the return of their gods. They were hanged for their crime, and the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] began.
