The Reckoners planned to neutralize Fortuity, an infamous [[High Epic\|High Epic]]. While [[Megan Tarash\|Megan]] was trying to lure Fortuity into a trap, Curveball appeared and gestured Fortuity to go back to Reeve Playhouse, interrupting Reckoners' scheme. Seeing an opportunity to meet his heroes, David showed up to distract Curveball. However, Curveball saw through his lie, and a gun fight broke out. Even though he had endless bullets, he wasn't that great of a shot. Curveball was killed by Megan.
