**Peret the Black** was a [[Pewter\|Pewterarm]] rapist in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Peret was the first criminal that [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] brought in as a lawman in the Roughs, around twenty years prior to his return to [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. As a Thug, Peret was notoriously dangerous and had a large bounty on his head. Wax decided to pursue him, and within a few days, he killed Peret and brought him back to the lawkeeper station draped over his horse.
Wax gained quite a bit of respect and notoriety for bringing in someone as vile as Peret. However, he later revealed to [[Marasi\|Marasi]] that he had been broke and the money was his primary motivation. He figured that any of the outlaws could kill him, so he might as well go after Peret since he was worth the most. When Wax first met [[Lessie\|Lessie]], she thought he looked like a dandy and was surprised that he had been able to kill someone like Peret the Black. Wax told her about what had really happenedâ€”he shot Peret in the back whilst he was relieving himself. Lessie mocked Wax, who jokingly claimed that he had killed Peret "as bravely as any man ever shot another in the back."
