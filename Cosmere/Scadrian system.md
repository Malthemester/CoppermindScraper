## Planets

The [[Mistborn series\|Mistborn series]] is set on this planet. It was created entirely by the Shards of Preservation and Ruin, who made their home here. The planet's orbit has changed multiple times. At the onset of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], [[Rashek\|Rashek]] used the power at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] to bring the planet nearer the sun in order to burn away the [[Deepness\|Deepness]]. This necessitated the creation of [[Ashmounts\|ashmounts]] to block out the too-close sun. [[Harmony\|Harmony]] corrected the orbit to its current position upon his [[Ascension\|Ascension]].


A blue gas giant with six moons. The largest planet in the Scadrian system.


A red gas giant with five moons and a ring. A comet belt lies beyond Aagal Uch.


Two unnamed dwarf planets lie outside of the Scadrian system's comet belt.

## Astronomy
In physical space, [[Rosharan System\| Roshar]] appears to be the nearest solar system. Its star is part of the "Awakener" constellation. The Scadrian [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] is known as [[Expanse of the Vapors\|Expanse of the Vapors]], and can be accessed from [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is close enough to the [[Threnody\| Threnodite Cognitive Realm]] that [[Shade\|shades]] appearing at its borders are a legitimate concern.

## Inhabitants
The inhabitants of Scadrial were created by Ruin and Preservation in the image of [[Yolen\| Yolish]] humans. The [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] saw the creation of two additional species - the shapeshifting [[Kandra\|kandra]] and near-mindless [[Koloss\|koloss]] - through Shardic intervention and the use of [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] on humans. Following the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], the koloss became a true breeding race, the koloss-blooded.
As of right now, the other planets in the system are uninhabited.

## History
The planet of Scadrial did not exist prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]]. The Shards of [[Preservation\|Preservation]] and [[Ruin\|Ruin]] decided to create the planet from scratch, under the stipulation that Ruin would later be allowed to destroy it. However, Preservation betrayed Ruin, trapping him in the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], one of Scadrial's two [[Perpendicularity\| Perpendicularities]], to prevent the destruction, at the cost of his own mind and a significant chunk of his power.
At some point, a [[Sel\|Selish]] organization called the [[Ire\|Ire]] set up a base in the Scadrian Cognitive Realm, intending to claim the Shard of Preservation once its holder was dead.
Over centuries, several people have held the power of the Well of Ascension. A number of civilizations have developed during that period, and the technological advancement had almost reached the steam age. The penultimate of those holders was a Terrisman named [[Rashek\|Rashek]], who moved the planet closer to the sun in an attempt to burn away the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] while holding the power, and folded all the existing states into the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] under his rule. The last holder, [[Vin\|Vin]], chose to release the power - releasing Ruin as well - due to the Shard's misdirection. The following events saw Ruin and Preservation merged into [[Harmony\|Harmony]], who restored the system to its previous orbit and rejuvenated the land in an event known as the Catacendre.
While the civilization on Scadrial has since recovered from this ordeal, in recent years the system appears to be invaded by an [[Trell (Trellism)\|unknown power]].
