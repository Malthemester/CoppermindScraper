**Rilla** is a woman on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
She was presumably a [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] member of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] nobility, as she had a relationship with [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] while staying in the Alethi warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in 1173. After Adolin stopped courting [[Deeli\|Deeli]], he courted two other women and [[Janala Lustow\|Janala Lustow]] over the span of a few months before getting involved with Rilla. She and Adolin had a falling out after she found out that he was still seeing Janala. [[Renarin\|Renarin]] chided Adolin for his treatment of Rilla, and Adolin admitted to himself that he was at fault.
