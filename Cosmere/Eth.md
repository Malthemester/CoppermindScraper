**Eth** is a member of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]].
[[Mart\|Mart]] is his brother. Eth and a number of the other bridgemen receive basic field medic training from [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. Eth is also a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] squire to Kaladin Stormblessed.

## History
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] took Eth, [[Moash\|Moash]], [[Drehy\|Drehy]] and [[Mart\|Mart]] to relieve [[Skar\|Skar]] and his unit after listening to the King's proclamation on the collection of Gemhearts. They went to guard [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and the king at the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]] during a meeting, and Kaladin assigned Eth and Mart to guard the door, telling them to stop anyone but a Highprince from entering without permission from within. After the meeting, Moash, Eth, and Mart followed Dalinar out.
When [[Szeth\|Szeth]] attacked Dalinar, Mart and Eth had been assigned to guard the king. After the attack, Eth treated [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] and Dalinar's wounds before Kaladin returned to them.
Eth and Mart were guarding Adolin during one of Kaladin's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] training sessions.
At Adolin's duel against four others, Eth and Skar were on duty guarding him in his preparation room.
Eth survived Szeth's attack on Dalinar during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], but his brother Mart did not; Eth mourned over his body.
Eth became a Radiant squire to Kaladin and in one training session stuck a rock to his hand.
During another practice exercise of Bridge Four, Eth used the term "shellheads" in reference to the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]]. He told [[Rlain\|Rlain]] that he didn't mean any offence and asked Rlain if he knew why the [[Fused\|Fused]] were attacking trade caravans on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Eth called the Fused Rlain's "kinsmen," to which Rlain responded by saying that the Fused were his enemy and he and his people had spent their entire lives hiding from their old gods.
Before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] sent someone to Bridge Four to steal [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], which Eth was holding at the time. The assassin used [[Teft\|Teft's]] Bridge Four uniform coat as a disguise to get in the barracks. During the attack, Rock and [[Bisig\|Bisig]] were badly injured, and Eth was killed.
