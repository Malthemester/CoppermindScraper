**Soldier Field** is an old football stadium that the Reckoners used to fight [[Steelheart (Epic)\|Steelheart]] in.
There is nothing of real importance around Soldier Field, and thus usually no one goes near it. Like the rest of the city, it was turned to steel during the [[Great Transfersion\|Great Transfersion]].
The Reckoners use Soldier Field as a place to fight Steelheart. They create nooks and sniper nests using the tensors, and replace the old headlights (which were turned to steel) with new UV headlights.
