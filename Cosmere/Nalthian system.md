The **Nalthian system** is the name given to the planetary system containing the [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] of [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. In addition to Nalthis, it includes one gas giant, one outer planet, a comet belt, and a [[Cognitive Realm\|cognitive]] anomaly manifesting in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. Notably, both of the non-inhabited planets are named like the [[Returned\|Returned]], such as [[Lightsong\|Lightsong the Brave]].

## Planets

Nalthis is the only planet in the system known to be inhabited -- it has a large human population and a [[Shard\|Shard]], [[Endowment\|Endowment]]. Humans on Nalthis differ from those elsewhere in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] in that they are born with [[Breath\|Breath]], Endowment's [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Breath provides a number of passive benefits, as well as fuel for the local magic system, [[Awakening\|Awakening]].
Nalthis has one moon, **Rrendos**. It also shares its orbit with an unspecified [[Cognitive anomaly\|cognitive anomaly]], although it's unknown whether it passes through it once a year, or if the anomaly follows the planet's motion.


A red gas giant, and the largest planet in the Nalthian system. It has at least six moons orbiting it.


A small, violet outer planet, located at a considerable distance from Farkeeper. A comet belt lies beyond Nightstar, marking the system's edge.

## Astronomy
The Nalthian sun is a yellow star, similar to those of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] and [[Sel\|Sel]]. The system is located in the "Awakener" constellation. Its closest known stellar neighbor is the [[Selish system\|Selish system]], with [[Rosharan system\|Greater Roshar]] a bit further away.
The local name of Nalthis' [[Subastral\|subastral]] is unknown. It's been speculated that it corresponds to what Rosharans name the [[Expanse of Vibrance\|Expanse of Vibrance]], in which case it would directly neighbor [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. There are, in fact, regular caravans travelling between the two subastrals, carrying both goods and people. The Nalthian system is extremely popular with [[Worldhoppers\|worldhoppers]], to the point of there being a customs check in the vicinity of the local [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]]. This sole perpendicularity is located on Nalthis, in the jungles of the nation of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].
