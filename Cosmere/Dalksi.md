\- Dalksi upon the mention of her application on becoming Prime[1]


**Dalksi** is an [[Azish\|Azish]] [[Vizier\|vizier]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
In 1173, after the assassination of two [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasixes]] by [[Szeth\|Szeth]], Dalksi attended the holy conclave in the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] to chose a new Prime. Dalksi, like many, feared for her life and did not want to be chosen as the new Prime. In order to avoid being chosen, she submitted a poor application, misspelling several words in her essay among other intentional mistakes. Another vizier attempted to compliment Dalksi's essay, but Dalksi denied the compliment, claiming that [[Axikk\|Axikk's]] essay was superior.
During her time in the palace, Lift got to know Dalksi better, although she never bothered to learn her name, referring to her as **Dalky** instead.
She is one of [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn's]] highest advisers, and is present when the Azish fleet escapes [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] prior to the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. She asks Yanagawn what he means when he says that Lift is 'the other kind of smart'. She then opens the door for [[Vono\|Vono]] to report that Lift had escaped.
Dalksi has an odd-looking nose that resembles a spigot. Her hair is powder white, and she is the oldest of Yanagawn's advisers, but isn't the most senior.
