The **Poco** is a basic [[Starfighter\|starfighter]] used by the [[DDF\|DDF]]. [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] first ship was a Poco.
Spensa states that "they looked like glorified pencils with wings." These are the ships recreated holographically in the [[Flight School\|Flight School's]] flight simulators.

## Capabilities
Pocos are equipped with [[Destructor\|Destructors]], [[IMP\|IMPs]], [[Light-lance\|Light-lances]], shields, and a A-19 booster. Other features include gravitational capacitors ([[GravCap\|GravCaps]]) and an [[Acclivity ring\|acclivity ring]].
Pocos do not have a self-destruct function, but do have the capability to eject the pilot in case of crash.
