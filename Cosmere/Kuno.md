>“*Most people, they want to ignore men like him. They shove them off to the ardents. You might think us callous, but we're the only ones who care. Who try.*”
\-Kuno to Kaladin[1]


**Kuno** is an [[Ardent\|ardent]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He works at the [[Devotary of Mercy\|Devotary of Mercy]] alongside [[Yara\|Yara]].

## Appearance and Personality
Kuno, like all ardents, has a shaved head. He is a younger man who has poor eyesight and wears spectacles, which he frequently polishes.
Kuno is absentminded and generally unexcitable. He is defensive of the ardentia's understanding of how to treat those with mental illness at first, but is willing to admit that Kaladin has an insight that they do not. He is nervous that the [[Fused\|Fused]] might find out that he is aiding their enemies.

## History
>“*With all due respect, Brightlord, you should leave medical issues to those trained in them.*”
\-Kuno to Kaladin[1]

Kuno opened the door for [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Teft\|Teft]] when they arrived looking for [[Noril\|Noril]]. He refused to reveal patient information to them until Teft summoned [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]] to prove that they were of sufficient authority. He brought them to Noril's room after explaining that the man had tried to commit suicide; on the way, he defended the ardentia while Teft expressed disbelief that keeping the patients locked up in the dark would help and a disgruntled Kaladin plied him with questions regarding treatment. After warning them of Noril's instability, Kuno allowed the two into the room to speak with him.
When Kaladin helped Noril to his feet to take him outside so they could talk, Kuno protested that he couldn't do that. He quailed under Kaladin's glare, however, and settled for following the little group to the balcony. Kuno was astonished to see that Noril was talking with Kaladin and Teft, and he was embarrassed to realize that they had been right all along. Kaladin grilled him on what they were taught to do for people with various mental ailments, and Noril confessed that the treatment was all the same: lock them up in the dark to avoid overstimulation. He realized that they needed to do something different for the patients' sakes, but expressed to Kaladin that it would take a lot of time and resources to change things in the ardentia. Kaladin asked that Noril be released into his care instead and warned Kuno that he would be back for the others.
After the [[Fused\|Fused]] took over [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and Kaladin fled from them with the unconscious Teft, Kaladin realized that the [[Devotary of Mercy\|Devotary of Mercy]] would be a good place to go for supplies. Kuno was reading when Kaladin arrived and asked for supplies. He took Kaladin to a storeroom and let him collect what he needed but had to tell him that they didn't have any weapons in the sanitarium. When Kaladin alluded to his return for more supplies at a later date, Kuno nervously agreed that he could keep quiet. Kaladin realized he could use a boost of confidence, so he let Kuno see him drink in some [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] before leaving.
