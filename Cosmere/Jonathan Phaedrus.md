### Powers

### Weaknesses
Prof's weakness is failure, and the risk of it. This can be seen as he refused to enter a contest pre-Calamity and his reluctance to use his abilities in Steelheart instead, gifting them to others.

## History
Prior to the arrival of [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]], Jonathan Phaedrus was a fifth-grade science teacher. He was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Tia\|Tia]], who at the time worked for NASA. At some point after the arrival of Calamity, the school where he worked was destroyed by an Epic while still in session. The details of this incident are unclear, and it is possible that the Epic in question was Phaedrus himself experiencing his Rending.. Sometime prior to the events of Steelheart, he was part of a team of "hero" Epics consisting of himself, [[Lincoln\|Lincoln]], [[Abigail Reed\|Abigail Reed]], and [[Amala\|Amala]]. This venture ended in catastrophe as every member of the group other than Phaedrus succumbed to Calamity's corruption. Sometime later, he and Tia founded the Reckoners.

### [[Steelheart\|Steelheart]]
David manages to track down the Reckoners, a rebel group fighting against the Epics, and finds Megan Tarash, a member of the Reckoners, in Newcago. After he helps her as the Reckoners plan a hit on Fortuity, David convinces Jonathan to let him join. Jonathan later plans to free Newcago from Steelheart's influence by killing the Epic after David reveals that he saw Steelheart bleed. Jonathan is revealed to be a High Epic and a [[Gifter\|Gifter]] that shares his powers through the guise of advanced technological equipment such as the tensors. He later fights Steelheart and helps David in eventually taking the Epic down.

### [[Firefight\|Firefight]]
Following the events of Steelheart, Phaedrus travelled with David to [[Babylon Restored\|Babylon Restored]] to take out his old friend Abigail Reed, now known as the Epic Regalia. Despite being an Epic himself, Prof consistently tells David that all Epics are evil, including Megan, after David tries to assure him that Megan was fighting the corruption of her powers. Due to Regalia's plotting, Phaedrus is forced to use his powers more and more. This culminates when Regalia detonates a bomb made using [[Obliteration\|Obliteration's]] powers to destroy Babylon Restored. Phaedrus is able to stop the detonation but the extensive use of his powers drives him over the edge and makes him a full Epic. He subsequently kills two members of the Reckoners team, [[Exel\|Exel]] and [[Valentine\|Val]], and tries to kill David Charleston, but is stopped by [[Megan Tarash\|Firefight]].

### [[Calamity\|Calamity]]
In the third book of the series, Prof served as the main antagonist of the book. While consumed by his powers, Prof went to Ildithia and continued Regalia's plan of taking [[Larcener\|Larcener's]] assumer abilities and replacing Calamity, unaware of the fact the Larcener himself was Calamity. He faced off against David's team twice, but soon David redeemed him by making him confront his weakness. In the end, he aids David in taking down Calamity and freeing the Epics from the corruption of their powers; however, he grieves from his actions and his murders of Tia, Exel, and Val while he was under the corruption of his powers.

### [[Lux (book)\|Lux]]
After Jax‚Äôs brother was killed by the Epic [[Lovestruck\|Lovestruck]] and his family killed by [[Obliteration\|Obliteration]], Prof found Jax, took care of him, and fed him as they traveled across the country. He took Jax to the [[Coop\|Coop]], leaving him to be trained by [[Zeff\|Zeff]] as a Reckoner.
Later on, Prof visited the Coop to check up on Jax‚Äôs progress and give the Texas Reckoners new assignments.
