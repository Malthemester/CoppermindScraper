The **United Governments** is a human government or association of governments on [[Earth (Skyward)\|Earth]]. It has existed since at least 2071, when first contact was made with the [[Tenasi\|tenasi]].
When a tenasi diplomatic vessel arrived at Earth to investigate [[Cytonics\|cytonic]] "squeaks" that came through the [[Phone Company\|Phone Company's]] early cyto system, the United Governments military accidentally shot it down with a single missile. The Phone Company stepped in and brokered the [[Tenasi Agreement\|Tenasi Agreement]], negotiating peace in exchange for being placed above the law. It is unknown if the United Governments military still exists by the time [[Jason Write\|Jason Write]] decides to reveal faster-than-light travel in 2211, but the United Governments still exists and grants patents.
