**Chapaou** is a short, balding man working as a cab driver at [[Ashweather Carriage and Coach\|Ashweather Carriage and Coach]].
He drove Coach 16 on the night of [[Lady ZoBell\|Lady ZoBell's]] party and was hired by someone who gave their name as Shanwan - a Terris name meaning "secret". He was traumatized by seeing [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] and ended up at a [[Soothing parlor\|Soothing parlor]] on Decan Street trying in vain to forget.

>“* I found I hadn't been carrying a man, but a monster. A mistwraith, with bones and sinew exposed, and a face of stretched muscle and grinning teeth. It looked at me, all smiles, and scrambled up toward the hole. It pressed that exposed eye against the slot, and then it changed. It changed. Skin growing over its face, like mine. A twisted, broken version of me.*”
\- Chapaou [2]
