## Development
*Skyward* was originally planned as a YA novel set in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Brandon began working on it in October 2017 after some difficulty with *Apocalypse Guard* caused that book to be delayed, and updated his website to read "Mystery Project". When he revealed the title of this new project he also announced that it was no longer planned as part of the cosmere because the story needed to reference Earth to work properly. The trilogy was officially announced in State of the Sanderson 2017. In an AMA leading up to the release of the first book, Brandon stated that the trilogy would likely become a four book series.
