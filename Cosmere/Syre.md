\-Sarene on the use of syres[1]


The **syre** is a light sword created in [[Jaador\|Jaador]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. In Jaador, it was originally known as a **jedaver**, but is now more commonly known by its [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] name, syre.
In [[Jaador\|Jaador]], the syre was originally a weapon for scouts, but fell into disuse before being reintroduced as a fencing weapon for the nobility. From there, the use of syres spread to [[Duladel\|Duladel]], where they are sometimes known as **kmeer**. Duladel, however, was generally neutral, and the republican class turned fencing with the syre into a sport rather than using it for potentially lethal duels. Modern day Dulas consider the ability to fence with a syre a requirement for being viewed as a solider, regardless of how many battles a person has won. From Duladel, syres skipped over [[Arelon\|Arelon]], as the [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] disapproved of anything resembling violence, but made their way to [[Teod\|Teod]], where fencing with them became a sport for women instead of men.
When [[Sarene\|Sarene]] moved to Arelon, she brought several of her syres with her, and eventually began teaching the noblewomen to fence, thus introducing the sport to Arelon.
[[Raoden\|Raoden]], posing as a [[Duladel\|Dula]] named Kaloo, said that though Dulas can duel well, a syre isn't much good against a trained soldier.
