## Appearance and Personality
He has a nasal accent that is common among Rifters. He wears simple steel armor in battle and carries his massive [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)\|Oathbringer]]. Tanalan is close to [[Tanalan\|his son]], who shares his name.
Although he shares the independent streak of most Rifters, Dalinar considered him to be a fine enough fellow. Tanalan does not recognize [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] claim to the throne of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. He is stubborn and fearless.

## Attributes and Abilities
Tanalan holds the rank of highlord, placing him in the third [[Dahn\|dahn]]. As citylord, he leads the city of Rathalas, which has a population that numbers in the tens of thousands. He is able to competently wield a Shardblade, although he does not have Shardplate.

## History
Tanalan and Dalinar were acquainted prior to Gavilar's war of unification. After losing a game of [[Pawns\|pawns]] to Dalinar, Tanalan cheekily paid off his bet with small bits of ruby dropped into a hundred bottles of wine, to Dalinar's amusement.
In 1141, Gavilar attacked the Rift. At the time, the majority of Alethkar was not yet in Gavilar's control and Rathalas was a stepping stone towards unification. Gavilar, Dalinar, and [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] led the attack on the city. Tanalan refused to submit; he was in possession of the [[Sunmaker\|Sunmaker's]] Shardblade, and used it to duel Dalinar. However, Dalinar's Shardplate and fighting skill (enhanced by the [[Thrill\|Thrill]]) allowed him to quickly bring down Tanalan with a surprise charge. When Tanalan's soldiers tried to kill Dalinar, he brought down the platform they were fighting on, mortally wounding Tanalan in the process. Tanalan was then taken to a secret hideout with [[Tanalan's mother\|his wife]] and child, but Dalinar followed him. Upon arriving, the Thrill left Dalinar as he saw Tanalan's son take up his Shardblade to try and defend his broken, dying father. Dalinar took Oathbringer but did not kill the child.
After Tanalan's death, his son eventually took his title and continued the rebellion, culminating in the burning of Rathalas.
