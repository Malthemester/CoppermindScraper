\-Wax, on Push[3]


Push is a [[Steel\|steel]] [[Misting\|Misting]] also known as a [[Coinshot\|Coinshot]]. He is a skilled [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]] and gunman, to the point that he was able to injure and nearly kill [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] during a fight. He can fly through the air gracefully and easily Push incoming bullets away from himself.

## History
He was employed by the criminal organization known as the [[Set\|Set]], and was partnered with a [[Lurcher\|Lurcher]] nicknamed [[Pull\|Pull]]. The pair dressed similarly and worked together during heists and other jobs.
In 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the Set hired the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] to perform robberies and kidnappings, and [[Mister Suit\|Mister Suit]] assigned Push and Pull to support [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] in these efforts. They acted as bodyguards for Suit, and were also present to defend against potential interference by [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]].
Wax indeed stowed away on the [[Breaknaught\|Breaknaught]] knowing that the Vanishers would steal it. Miles anticipated this and warned Push and Pull that Wax was likely present before the train car was opened in the Vanishers workshop; Push was angry that Miles had not warned them sooner. Wax evaded an ambush waiting outside the Breaknaught by creating a diversion with dynamite, and Push and Pull pursued him up the [[Ironspine Building\|Ironspine Building]]. Push was able to Steelpush [[Vindication\|Vindication]] out of Wax's hands, but was lucky to evade an [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] bullet from Wax after he retrieved the gun. The Allomancers continued to duel; Push shot the lawman in the arm, but Wax used a clever strategy that caused Push to go flying away from the building.
[[Marasi\|Marasi]] then killed Pull with a rifle that she had gotten from [[Ranette\|Ranette]]. As Push returned to the fight, he nearly killed Wax and Marasi, and then angrily pursued Marasi seeking vengeance. Marasi was forced to drop the rifle as a decoy, and Push retrieved it. He attempted to shoot [[Wayne\|Wayne]], but was unsuccessful. He confirmed to Miles that Pull had been killed.
Wax and Wayne knew Push was dangerous, but were not sure how to take him out. Although he had dropped Vindication, Wax realized that he could use a hazekiller round intended for Coinshots by "firing" it with a Steelpush. The round worked as intended, and the ceramic tip of the bullet hit an unsuspecting Push in the eye, killing him.
