**Lightning** is an [[Epic\|Epic]], and is a member of [[Snowfall\|Snowfall's]] group of Epics in Sacramento. It is likely Lightning has lightning-based abilities.
When [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]] first meets the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]], he thought Lightning would be a good target on the Reckoner's list of Epics to kill.
Since the Reckoners generally attack High Epics with a prime invincibility, it is likely Lightning is a High Epic with one such ability.
