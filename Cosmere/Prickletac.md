**Prickletac** or **Twisted Spine** is a type of plant native to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and other areas.
Only the buds at the very ends of the limbs of a prickletac shrub are actually alive. It is composed of a colony of tiny buds, each with a single retractable spine. Every new generation grows on top of the deceased generation below it. After a generation of prickletacs die, their remnants become stone-like, creating strong and inflexible limbs.
Prickletac spreads when a limb gets too heavy and breaks off. The living buds from the broken limb are scattered and form new plants.

## Trivia
Prickletac was inspired by barnacles and tree coral.
