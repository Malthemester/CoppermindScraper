**Lee** is a soldier who is in [[Hershel\|Hershel's]] squad during the raid on a Russian satellite, when [[Calamity\|Calamity]] granted powers to all the [[Epic\|Epics]]. When [[Steelheart\|Specialist Jackson]] gained his powers and shot off [[O'Brien\|O'Brien]]‚Äôs arm, Lee and the other members of the squad aimed their guns at Jackson. Lee was outraged, and ordered Jackson to get on the ground and interlock his hands behind his head. Jackson told Lee to put down his weapon, and that he is safe with him. Lee refused, and shot Jackson in the chest several times. The bullets didn‚Äôt harm Jackson, and he was furious at the betrayal. Lee shot the rest of his magazine at Jackson, who then killed him with blasts of energy.
