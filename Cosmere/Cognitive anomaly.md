A **Cognitive anomaly** is a phenomenon in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] related to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
The only known instance of a Cognitive anomaly is in the [[Nalthian system\|Nalthian system]]. The scholars of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] have a star chart that shows an anomaly within the orbital path of [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. The map's representation of the anomaly resembles a roughly planet-sized gaseous cloud; it is unclear if this is a stylized depiction or if the anomaly actually exists in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]].

## Anchoring
Silvery chains that originate on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] somehow allow a user to "anchor" themselves through a Cognitive anomaly. The implications of anchoring are unknown, but the chains are incredibly rare and valuable on other planets. While traveling through [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] notices a thin silver chain offered by a [[Cultivationspren\|cultivationspren]] vendor for a seemingly exorbitant price. Although [[Silver\|silver]] exhibits magical properties on Threnody, the exact composition of the chains remains unknown.
[[Raboniel\|Raboniel]], a cosmere-aware [[Fused\|Fused]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], is given a metal item in a bag by [[Mraize\|Mraize]], presumably a silver chain. She is shocked to see it, and calls it a priceless wonder from the land of the dead.
The chains are known to be used by the scholars of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]]. Raboniel notes that her chain has no use to her within the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]], implying that there is no Cognitive anomaly there.
