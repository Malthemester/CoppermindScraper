## Appearance and Personality
Dockson has a squarish face, which Kelsier observes is well-suited to his moderately stocky build. He has black hair and sports a short half-beard, the Scadrian term for a goatee. Since he "first put forth whiskers some twenty years before," we can assume Dockson is middle-aged by the events of Mistborn. He often wears clothing of noble origin. Both Sazed and Vin feel noble suits fit him better than the others in the crew.
Dockson is responsible for keeping the crew operational, demonstrating aptitude for organization and administration. Most often he tries to direct [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and the others but allows himself to joke with the other members from time to time. He is quite diligent in his duties to ensure the crew has everything they need to remain functioning and is sometimes quite stern.
After Kelsier's death, however, his mirth vanishes. He regrets the way he's become. He feels he is a man who has gotten what he wanted, but realizes he shouldn't have desired it so badly. Despite this, his role as administrator never falters.
At least prior to Kelsier being sent to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]], Dockson was into brawling.

## History
 by  Katie Payne  With [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and the other members of his [[Kelsier's crew\|crew]]
In his early life, Dockson was a plantation [[Skaa\|skaa]] under Lord [[Devinshae\|Devinshae]]. It was a hard life, but he ate more regularly than a street skaa. Amongst plantation lords, Devinshae was rather lenient, which meant he "rarely" beat his skaa to death. Dockson started to sneak between hovels to spend time with his girlfriend, [[Kareien\|Kareien]]. The other skaa played along, hiding them from the taskmasters, because their romance inspired them. But one day, Lord Devinshae took Kareien to his house and raped her, returning her body in the next morning. The following evening, Dockson escaped from the plantation. He later met [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and they started to steal from nobles, eventually becoming the most infamous crewleaders in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], even having no powers.Eventually, Kelsier met and married a [[Tineye\|Tineye]] named [[Mare\|Mare]]. Dockson was involved in their plan to steal whatever was inside the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] secret room, but didn‚Äôt actively participate in the mission. The plan failed, and Kelsier and Mare where caught and sent to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]]. Dockson managed to evade capture but was forced into hiding. He continued to work as a thief and planner, but on a smaller scale.
When Kelsier became a Mistborn and returned to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], he first sought out Dockson and recruited him for his plan. Dockson once again became Kelsier‚Äôs organizer and right hand man.
Dockson met his death with a sword in hand during the [[Battle of Luthadel\|Battle of Luthadel]]. Seeing his impending end, he offered himself a little redemption and remarked that had things been different -- had they turned on the nobility as he had wanted to in the [[Collapse\|Collapse]] -- then he and others would have been no better than beasts. He believed that they had done the right thing after all.

## Relationships
### Elend Venture
Dockson does not get along with [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] since he thinks Kelsier wouldn't approve of Elend ruling, and his own conscious desire to distance himself from a truth about himself: admitting to himself that Elend feels guilty for the acts of the nobility would mean Dox has to confront his own atrocities towards the nobility.

### Hammond
Dockson has a rivalry with [[Hammond\|Hammond]]; that is why they spend so little time conversing in the books. They tend to get on each other's nerves in their brief interactions when they're either formulating a plan or arguing. However, when they have a goal to work toward, they can keep going.
