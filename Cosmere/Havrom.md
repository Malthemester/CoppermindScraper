## Appearance and Personality
Based on his title as a battalionlord, Havrom is presumably a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] of the fourth [[Dahn\|dahn]]. He is "built like a tower" and wears his beard long with his chin clean shaven; this is a traditional [[Horneater\|Horneater]] style that he wears because he has some Unkalaki ancestry. He holds his officers and soldiers to the high standards of the Kholin army.

## History
In 1173, Havrom was serving as the commander of the Fifth Battalion of the Kholin army on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] messaged him and asked him to gather the soldiers in his camp whom [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] had previously questioned regarding the cut in [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] saddle strap. Dalinar wanted to find out what Sadeas had asked them. Havrom ensured that all of Dalinar's orders were followed and that his battalion presented itself properly when Dalinar and [[Adolin\|Adolin]] arrived.

## Trivia
[[Colot\|Colot]] and [[Tallan\|Tallan]] are both mentioned as captains in the Fifth Battalion and likely served under Havrom.
