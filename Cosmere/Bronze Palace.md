The **Bronze Palace** is the seat of the government of [[Azir\|Azir]] and the home of the Azish emperor, the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]].

## Location and Appearance
The Bronze Palace is located in [[Azimir\|Azimir]], the capital of [[Azir\|Azir]]. It lies a short distance away from the Grand Market in the city centre.
The name is derived from the palace's distinctive appearance: everything within, from the plants and rocks to the buildings themselves, has been [[Soulcasting\|Soulcast]] into bronze. This even includes trees, which serve a purely decorative purpose.
A tall wall encircles the whole palace complex. Within, the Bronze Palace is comprised of a series of rounded, bulbous-looking buildings reminescent of giant [[Rockbud\|rockbuds]], coated in metal leaf. Many of the buildings are topped by spires and have numerous windows on their upper floors. The main structure is the largest building in the palace and contains, among others, the [[Vizier\|viziers']] chambers, the kitchens, and the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime's]] living quarters.
The areas between the buildings are flat, with roads wide enough for carriages to ride through. There are several different gardens there, including one of Soulcast plants and a sculpture garden. The latter serves as a meeting place for important officials to discuss state matters. Those officials, as well as visiting diplomats, travel between the various buildings by [[Chull\|chull]]-pulled rickshaws.
Within the main structure, illumination is provided by [[Polestone\|gemstone]]-filled metal lamps and chandeliers. The chambers of the palace are decorated in traditional Azish style, with rugs adorned with large patterns covering every surface. The corridors between them are wide and more than fifteen feet tall, with paintings hanging on the walls and blue and red carpets lying on the floors. In contrast, the passage leading directly to the Prime's bedroom is quite narrow, to prevent anyone sneaking by. However, there are small ornamental ledges near the ceiling, although they are too narrow to walk on without assistance. The corridors used by the servants are hidden from the palace's representative sections by false walls.
A small, narrow outbuilding is located near the entrance to the central structure, containing a long table and a number of couches, which are decorated in patterns of orange and red. It serves as a waiting area for petitioners who are not allowed to meet with the Prime directly.

## History
The date of the Bronze Palace's construction is unknown. At some point, perhaps during its creation, the palace was [[Soulcasting\|Soulcast]] into bronze, as proof of Azir's wealth and prosperity.
During the year 1173, the Palace saw numerous [[Prime Aqasix\|Primes]] assassinated on its grounds by the [[Szeth\|Assassin in White]]. It was during that time that [[Lift\|Lift]], [[Gawx\|Gawx]] and the rest of Huqin's crew attempted to rob the palace, leading to [[Gawx\|Gawx]] becoming the new Prime Aqasix after being killed by [[Nale\|Nale]] and subsequently healed by [[Lift\|Lift]].
Folllowing the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] visited the Bronze Palace to negotiate with [[Azir\|Azir's]] leadership over whether or not the country would join the alliance with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Though he was not allowed to meet with the Prime, the essays he brought with him were sufficient to convince the viziers.
