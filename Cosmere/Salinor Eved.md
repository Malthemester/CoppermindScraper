## Attributes and Abilities
Salinor is a duelist who fights in [[Flamestance\|Flamestance]]. He only has a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], no [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. While Salinor is skilled, he often boasted that he was a better duelist than the rankings showed.

## History
[[Adolin\|Adolin]] and his father, [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], hope to embarrass [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] and the others in his faction by gaining all of their Shards. Adolin's friend, [[Jakamav\|Jakamav]] suggests Salinor as a target, due to his boasting about his skill. In order to get Salinar to agree to the duel, Adolin has to wager both his Blade and his Plate for Salinor's Blade alone, an insult.
When Adolin and Salinor fight in their duel, Salinor borrows a set of the King's Plate. Adolin abandons his traditional [[Windstance\|Windstance]] to fight in [[Ironstance\|Ironstance]] in a brutal display of strength and skill. While Adolin breaks tradition in his conduct during the duel, he does not violate any rules, so Highlady [[Istow\|Istow]] is forced to award the victory to Adolin. Salinor initially refuses to give up his Blade, but after Adolin threatens him, he breaks the bond and gives it to Adolin. Adolin bestows the Blade upon his brother, [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]], so that he could have a complete set of Shards.
