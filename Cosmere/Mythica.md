The **Mythica** is a book written by [[Hessi\|Hessi]].
It is a book on the [[Unmade\|Unmade]], and [[Shallan\|Shallan]] says that the book wasn't received well. It is a new book, and mentions [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] at least once, to disagree with some of her work and questionings. This book is not in many bookstores, and the few that had it in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] were stolen. This book does not contain the information from the events of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
Hessi talks of most of the Unmade, such as [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] and [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]]. Hessi's Mythica advises the reader on how to tell the signs of some of the Unmade, and what to do if these signs are found. This usually involves running. She has found that Sja-anat was the most feared by Radiants, for her ability to corrupt spren--though it only spoke of "lesser spren" which she did not understand the meaning of--and was often referred to as an individual, when others were seen as forces instead. She can only speculate on the ninth Unmade, but has firm beliefs on the other eight. Hessi holds fast to the idea that the Unmade were spren imbued with vast powers, and as such are manifestations of concepts and divine forces as much as individuals. In the last section of this book, Hessi speculates on the ninth Unmade, going over anything she does not know enough about, or could have confused into another Unmade. She theorizes on whether the ninth is Dai-Gonarthis, and whether their actions could have truly caused the destruction of [[Aimia\|Aimia]]. Many Unmade she does not know much about, such as [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] and [[Chemoarish\|Chemoarish]]. She cannot find any speculation on their powers or effects, only to say that Ba-Ado-Mishram was a commander of the enemy forces, and that Chemoarish is not the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]].
In this book, Hessi attributes personalities to the Unmade, and describes how they ran wild during the [[Desolation\|Desolations]], the nine Unmade. She also claims not all of them were destroyed in [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], and insists that some are alive today. Hessi gives a brief description of the known unmade, saying what they do and what they are called. She believes that the three mindless Unmade are still around, [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] as the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], giving battle rage to both sides, and visions of red mist and dying animals, as said in the legends. [[Moelach\|Moelach]] as the [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattles]], because they seem to be regional, moving about across Roshar; Moelach was said to give their visions most commonly in the transition point between realms, when a soul is nearing the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]], and the Death Rattles seem oddly prophetic, too much so to be cast away as not a possibility. Hessi speculates that Moelach is the reason why predicting the future is of the enemy, as that telling the future is believed to originate from him. The third great mindless Unmade is Ashertmarn, Heart of the Revel. There is not much she can find that might come from this Unmade, but she speculates that the great debauchery of [[Bayala\|Bayala]] in 480, leading to dynastic collapse, may have been the influence of Ashertmarn.
Shallan finds the book while in Kholinar. She uses it to discover that there are two Unmade inside Kholinar: Sja-anat and Ashertmarn.

## Excerpts
### Page 3
>“*My research into the Unmade has convinced me that these things were not simply "spirits of the void" or "nine shadows who moved in the night." They were each a specific kind of spren, endowed with vast powers.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 3[6]


### Page 4
>“*I have done my best to separate fact from fiction, but the two blend like mixing paint when the Voidbringers are involved. Each of the Unmade has a dozen names, and the powers ascribed to them range from the fanciful to the terrifying.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 4[18]


### Page 7
>“*I should point out that although many personalities and motives are ascribed to them, I'm convinced the Unmade were still spren. As such, they were as much manifestations of concepts or divine forces as they were individuals.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 7[12]


### Page 12
>“*The most important point I wish to make is that the Unmade are still among us. I realize this will be contentious, as much of the lore surrounding them is intertwined with theology. However, it is clear to me that some of their effects are common in the world--and we simply treat them as we would manifestations of other spren.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 12[13]


### Page 26
>“*Taxil mentions Yelig-nar, named Blightwind, in an oft-cited quote. Though Jasnah Kholin has famously called its accuracy into question, I believe it.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 26[2]


### Page 27
>“*Yelig-nar had great powers, perhaps the powers of all the surges compounded into one. He could transform any Voidbringer into an extremely dangerous enemy. Curiously, three legends I found mention swallowing a gemstone to engage this process.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 27[19]


### Page 51
>“*Yelig-nar is said to consume souls, but I can't find any specific explanation I'm uncertain this lore is correct.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 51[20]


### Page 89
>“*Of the Unmade, Sja-anat was the most feared by the Radiants. They spoke extensively of her ability to corrupt spren, though only "lesser" spren--whatever that means.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 89[5]


### Page 90
>“*Lore suggested leaving a city if spren start acting strangely. Curiously, Sja-anat was often regarded as an individual, when others--like Moelach or Ashertmarn--were seen as forces.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 90[4]


### Page 121
>“*Nergaoul was known for driving forces into battle rage, lending them great ferocity. Curiously, he did this to both sides of a conflict, Voidbringer and human. This seems common in the less self-aware spren.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 121[21]


### Page 140
>“*I am convinced that Nergaoul is still active on Roshar, The accounts of the Alethi "Thrill" of battle align too well with ancient records--including the visions of red mist and dying creatures.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 140[14]


### Page 143
>“*Moelach is very similar to Nergaoul, though instead of inspiring a battle rage, he supposedly granted visions of the future. In this, lore and theology align. Seeing the future originates with the Unmade, and it is from the enemy.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 143[16]


### Page 144
>“*Moelach was said to grant visions of the future at different times--but commonly the transition point between realms. When a soul was nearing the Tranquiline Halls.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 144[22]


### Page 170
>“*Many cultures speak of the so-called Death Rattles that sometimes overtake people as they die. Tradition ascribes them to the almighty, but I find too many of them to be seemingly prophetic. This will be my most contentious assertion I am sure but I think these are the effects of Moelach persisting in our current times. Proof is easy to provide: the effect is regionalized, and tends to move across Roshar, this is the roving of the Unmade.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 170[15]


### Page 203
>“*Ashertmarn, the Heart of the Revel, is the final of the three great mindless Unmade. His gift to men is not prophecy or battle focus, but is lust for indulgence. Indeed, the great debauchery recorded form the court of Bayala in 480--which led to dynastic collapse--might be attributable to the influence of Ashertmarn.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 203[17]


### Page 224
>“*I find Ba-Ado-Mishram to be the most interesting of the Unmade. She is said to be keen of mind, a highprincess among the enemy forces, their commander during some of the Desolations. I do not know how this relates to the ancient god of the enemy, named Odium.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 224[11]


### Page 226
>“*There is very little information about Ba-Ado-Mishram in more modern times. I can only assume she, unlike many of them, returned to Damnation or was destroyed during Aharietiam.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 226[9]


### Page 231
>“*Chemoarish, the Dustmother, has some of the most varied lore surrounding her. The wealth of it makes sorting lies from truth extremely difficult. I do believe she is not the Nightwatcher, contrary to what stories claim.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 231[10]


### Page 250
>“*Re-Shephir, the Midnight Mother, is another Unmade who appears to have been destroyed in Aharietiam.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 250[23]


### Page 252
>“*The Midnight Mother created monster out of shadow and oil, dark imitations of what she saw or consumed. Their description matches no spren I can find in modern literature.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 252[24]


### Page 266
>“*It will not take a careful reader to ascertain that I have only mention eight of the Unmade here. Lore is confident there were nine, an unholy number, asymmetrical and often associated with the enemy.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 266[25]


### Page 266
>“*I am certain there are nine Unmade. There are many legends and names I could have misinterpreted, conflating two Unmade into one. In the next section, I will discuss my theories on this.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 266[7]


### Page 307
>“*If I'm correct and my research true, then the question remains. Who is the ninth Unmade? Is it truly Dai-Gonarthis? If so, could their actions have actually caused the complete destruction of Aimia?*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 307[8]
