## Appearance and Personality
She is in her late twenties. Straff describes her as having been attractive a decade before. Wrinkles on her forehead and around her eyes were beginning to appear. She was also the mother of some of Straff's many children.

## History
Every time Straff believed that [[Zane\|Zane]] had attempted to poison him, he called Amaranta and ordered her to brew a general antidote which was effective against common poisons. After Straff spurned her as a mistress, she became Zane's lover. Over time she had dosed him with an addictive drug, [[Black Frayn\|Black Frayn]]. As such, Zane didn't actually always attempt to poison his father, but simply led him to believe that he had.
When Zane disappeared from Straff's camp, Amaranta attempted to kill Straff by trying to brew an incorrect "Cure-All" potion. He realised that she was up to something and in a fit of anger throttled her to death.

## Quotes
>“* Fool. He never poisoned you— not a single time. Though, at my request, he often made you think that he had. And then, each time you ran to me. You suspected everything Zane did — and yet, you never once paused to think what was in the 'antidote' I gave you.*”
\- Amaranta to Straff Venture[2]


>“* That's what happens when you're addicted to a drug, Straff. When you get it, you feel better. When you don't get it . . . you die.*”
\- Amaranta to Straff Venture[2]
