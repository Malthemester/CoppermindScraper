## History
[[Allekatrase\|Allekatrase]] the Lens-wielder of [[Incarna\|Incarna]] became the first Smedry (a corruption of the Incarnan for Lens-wielder). He broke the Incarnan language and time itself in an attempt to stop others from gaining the Dark Talent.
Eventually, the kingdom of **Smedrious** was founded.
A later king abdicated his throne and the kingdom was abolished and absorbed into [[Nalhalla\|Nalhalla]]. The Smedry family became high-nobility. They kept a permanent seat in the [[Council of Kings\|Council of Kings]].
[[Attica Smedry\|Attica]] collects the [[Sands of Rashid\|Sands of Rashid]] and bequeaths them to his son [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz]].
