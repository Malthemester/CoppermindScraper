## History
Dilaf, a [[Derethi\|Derethi]] [[Gragdet\|gragdet]] from [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]], was at some point physically transformed to look like a young [[Arelene\|Arelene]] man using the magic of [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]]. His intent was to infiltrate [[Arelon\|Arelon]], which was the only remaining nation in [[Opelon\|Opelon]] not under Fjordell control. Seala met Dilaf after his transformation; despite his own distaste for his new body, she found him incredibly handsome. Dilaf set aside his aversion to [[Aonic\|Aonic]] people and they were eventually married.
Ten years prior to the [[Reod\|Reod]], Seala fell ill with a serious palsy and [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] grudgingly took her to [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] to be healed despite his distrust of their magic. An [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] used Aon Ien to heal her, but the symbol was drawn incorrectly and it flashed and malfunctioned, leaving her 'cursed'. Her hair fell out, her skin turned black, and she experienced incredible amounts of pain that never subsided, similar to fallen Elantrians after the Reod. Eventually, the pain was so intense that she effectively became [[Hoed\|Hoed]] and committed suicide by jumping from the walls of Elantris. Dilaf found her still alive and screaming, and he burned her broken body. He regretted ever bringing Seala to the Elantrians and wished they would have let her die.

## Legacy
Seala's death fuels Dilaf's intense hatred of Elantrians and causes him to become mentally unstable. Dilaf believes that the unnamed Elantrian healer knew of his origins and intentionally botched the Aon, but this is not confirmed. He sees the [[Invasion of Arelon\|invasion of Arelon]] as vengeance for Seala.
Raoden learns of Seala's case in a book about unusual occurrences with [[AonDor\|AonDor]]. Her case gives him some clues about the nature of fallen Elantrians and the corruption of their magic.

## Trivia
Her name is based on Aon Sea, which means "chastity or faithfulness".
