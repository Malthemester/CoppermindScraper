**Turqoise** is one of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds']] older [[Aspect\|aspects]]. He speaks with a "weird mix of a Texas accent and a stoner drawl." He presumably is an expert on art, drawing [[Kyle Walters\|Kyle Walters]] for Stephen to help identify him. Stephen thinks that he is a strange person.
