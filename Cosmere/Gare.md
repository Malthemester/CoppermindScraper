>“*Well then, maybe I don't like how everyone does what you tell them. I don’t care how good you are with a spear. My squad is my own.*”
\-Gare to Kaladin[1]


**Gare** is a squadleader in Highmarshal [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance & Personality
Gare is a beefy man, with a thick black beard. He fights with an axe rather than a spear, and is missing a section of his scalp on the right side of his head, presumably lost in combat. Kaladin considered Gare so incompetent that he might as well be fighting for the other army.
Gare is a stubborn and belligerent man. He does not enjoy taking Kaladin's bribes because he does not like how everyone listens to Kaladin all the time. However, it seems that his greed is stronger than his anger, as he eventually accepts the bribe.

## History
At some point Gare became a squadleader in Amaram's army. He appointed [[Nalem\|Nalem]] and [[Korabet\|Korabet]] to be his sergeants, and they often accompanied him around.
In 1172, [[Cenn\|Cenn]] was assigned to Gare's squad when he joined Amaram's army as a new recruit. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] found Gare and bribed him with some [[Spheres\|spheres]] to transfer Cenn to his squad.
