**Lolan** is a servant at [[Mercystar\|Mercystar's]] palace in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] circa 327.
When [[Vasher\|Vasher]] infiltrated the palace, he encountered a group of four servants in the hallway. He used his common distraction tactic of throwing [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] (in his sheath) at the group, and also tied up [[Taff\|Taff]] with an [[Awakening\|Awakened]] rope. Lolan picked up Nightblood, thinking he might use it against the attacker, while Rariv and the remaining servant ran for help. Vasher then knocked Lolan out while he was distracted by the sword. Taff was subsequently killed by [[Denth\|Denth]], but Lolan was spared, presumably because he was unconscious and would not have been able to identify Denth.
Lolan recounted his version of the events during an investigation by [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]], and was hesitant to show his injured hand. He eventually revealed that his hand had turned gray, meaning that he started to draw Nightblood and the sword began to consume his soul. This implies that Nightblood regarded Lolan as "evil", and he was indeed repentant after speaking to Lightsong.
