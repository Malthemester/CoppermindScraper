## Cover Synopsis
*There are secrets we have kept for so long. Watching. Sleepless. Eternal. And soon, they will no longer be ours.*
*The One Who Is Three seeks the captured soul, but does not know it. The imprisoned spren, so long ago forgotten. Can she free her own soul in time to find knowledge? The knowledge that damns all people of Roshar?*
*The Fallen Soldier caresses and loves the spear even as it gouges his own flesh. He steps ever forward, ever into darkness, without light. He can bring none with him, but that which he can kindle himself.*
*The Broken Sister sees her mistakes, and thinks she is one herself. She seems so far from her ancestors, but does not realize they carry her upon their shoulders. Toward victory, and toward that most important silence.*
*And the Mother of Machines, most important of them all, dances with liars at a grand ball. She must unmask them, find their hidden truths, and present them to the world. She must admit that the worst lies have been the ones she tells herself.*
*If she does, our secrets will finally become truths instead.*

## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[Rhythm of War/Summary\|/Summary]].
The book is set on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] one year after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] and follows the stories of [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Venli\|Venli]], and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]]. There are also several other characters who receive viewpoints; [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]], [[Lirin\|Lirin]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]], [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], [[Rlain\|Rlain]], [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]], [[Teft\|Teft]], [[Moash\|Moash]], [[Adin\|Adin]], [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], [[Lezian\|Lezian]], and [[Hoid\|Wit]] in the main text, Venli and [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] in flashbacks, and several others in the Interludes.

## Back cover copy
*After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar's crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.*
*Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin's scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength.*
*At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure.*

## Development
Brandon began writing Stormlight Archive 4 in January 2019, with publication planned for 2020. The original working title was *The Song of Changes*, which Brandon said was never meant to be the final title, and he later said the tentative title was *The Rhythm of War*. Eventually, it was announced that the book would be released on November 17th, 2020, although the final title was still unknown at that time. *Rhythm of War* was finally made the official title in February 2020, and the writing process ended in July 2020.
Initially, the book was to feature [[Eshonai\|Eshonai's]] flashbacks, with [[Venli\|Venli]] taking center stage in the present-day timeline. Eventually, Brandon began to waver on the former, wondering if Venli's flashbacks wouldn't work better for expanding on greater [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] mysteries. Ultimately, he decided on mixed flashbacks, with part set from Eshonai's perspective, while the other part set from Venli's.
The present-day story takes place approximately one year after the events of *Oathbringer*. While the title suggests greater focus on [[Singer\|singer]] characters, the remaining protagonists, including [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], and [[Szeth\|Szeth]], also feature prominently. The prologue is written from the perspective of [[Navani\|Navani]].
[[Wit\|Wit's]] epilogue in *Rhythm of War* is something that Brandon had been particularly looking forward to for a long time.
