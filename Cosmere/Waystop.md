A **waystop** is a safe location in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].

## Description
They are often inns, and people who come there can have food and drinks while enjoying temporary safety from the dangers of the Forests. They are generally not very complex, especially compared to the [[Fort\|forts]]. However, they are always safe from [[Shade\|shades]] and other dangers.

## Purpose
The Forests are extremely dangerous places, as they are full of [[Shade\|Shades]], and the people who live there are often criminals. As a result, people come to the waystops for temporary reprieve from the dangers. In a waystop it is expected that the owner will put up defenses, and ensure that there no danger or trouble. [[Silence\|Silence]] owns a waystop in the forests, and for safety, she puts up a ring of silver, which shades cannot touch, and pigs, which they do not like.
