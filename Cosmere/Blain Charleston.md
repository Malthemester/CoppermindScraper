## Appearance and Personality
Blain Charleston has tan skin and calloused hands from working in the sun. His hair is thinning, but Blain is not bothered by this fact and claims that he does not care about his hair as other people do. He has a soft voice, but will not hesitate to do what was right, even if it means putting his life on the line. Blain will always see the best in everyone.

## Attributes and Abilities
Blain Charleston is very good with a gun, and shoots Deathpoint in the forehead from a distance.
In the alternate reality with Firefight, Blain Charleston receives the same power portfolio as Steelheart, and Calamity confirms that they were the exact same powers.


## History
### Death of Wife
Some time after [[Calamity\|Calamity]] had come, Blain Charleston's wife and home were destroyed by an unnamed Epic. He survived with his son, [[David Charleston\|David]]. Still, Blain was very adamant that "good" Epics would come to save them.
They had a funeral for Blain's wife some time after this. David later remarked that this was the only time he heard his father raise his voice.

### First Union Bank
Two years after Calamity had come, Blain attempted to withdraw a large sum of money from [[First Union Bank (Newcago)\|First Union Bank]]. He brought with him all he had as collateral, but the mortgage man claimed that it was not enough. Blain protested that the previous person he had talked with had said it would be enough, but this mortgage would not agree. During this time, [[Deathpoint\|Deathpoint]] entered the bank, and began killing people. Blain attempted to sneak towards one of the fallen guard's guns, in an attempt to kill Deathpoint. Deathpoint saw Blain before he could shoot the gun, but Blain was saved by [[Steelheart (Epic)\|Steelheart]]. However, when Steelheart claimed that he was the emperor of the Chicago, and that anyone who did not serve him would die, Blain spoke up and said that Steelheart was better than the other Epics were, and that he was there to save them.
Goverment soldiers burst in and attempted to shoot Steelheart, but the bullets did no damage. Deathpoint hid behind Steelheart, and raised his hand to grab Steelheart's neck. Blain shot Deathpoint in the forehead, but accidentally grazed Steelheart's check. His bullet pierced through Steelheart's skin because Blain did not fear Steelheart. In rage, Steelheart crushed Blain against the stone pillar behind him, and shot him with his own gun. David rushed to Blain, and Blain's last word was to tell David to go.
Because Blain was already dead when Steelheart turned the city into steel during the [[Great Transfersion\|Great Transfersion]], Blain's body was turned into steel. When the Reckoners found the buried First Union Bank, David discovered Blain's steel corpse.

### Alternate Reality
In the alternate reality with Firefight, Blain Charleston had actually become Steelheart. He had the same power portfolio, but he fought evil instead of ruling Newcago. He wore the same outfit that Steelheart had worn in the "real" world, but included the Faithful's symbol on the front. Sometime after [[Invocation\|Invocation]] arrived, David was killed, and Blain blamed himself, although Deathpoint was actually the one who killed David during the alternate reality's First Union Bank scene.
When David brought Calamity into this alternate reality, Calamity saw the love and kindness in Blain. This caused Calamity to question his assumptions about humanity, and he stopped influencing the Epics in the "real" world to do evil.
After Calamity was gone, Blain was able to restart a relationship with David, thanks to [[Megan Tarash\|Megan's]] powers.
