## Excerpts
>“*'Tis said it was warm in the land far awayWhen Voidbringers entered our songs.We brought them home to stayAnd then those homes became their own,It happened gradually.And years ahead 'twil still be said 'tis how it has to be.*”
\-12th stanza[1]

>“*Smokeform for hiding and slipping between men.A form of power, like human Surges.Bring it 'round again.Though crafted of gods,It was by Unmade hand.Leaves its force to be but one of foe or friend.*”
\-127th stanza[2]
