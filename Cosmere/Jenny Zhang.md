**Jenny Zhang** is one of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds's]] [[Aspect\|aspects]]. She's a tall, mature Asian woman with a square face and prominent smile lines.
She was created unknowingly by Stephen at the beginning of his search for [[Sandra\|Sandra]]. Before Stephen realizes that she's an aspect, he says that she is a reporter and writer who writes almost voyeuristic pop biographies. After Stephen realizes that she is an aspect, she has a difficult time following the rules, frequently appearing from nowhere. She claims to be a biographer aspect, and Stephen assumes she's writing about him. However, after his aspects disappear, she reveals that she's actually creating biographies of his *aspects*. These biographies allow him to remember the dead aspects and write about them.
