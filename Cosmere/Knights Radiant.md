\-Kaladin and Syl on what the Knights Radiant were like.[1]


The **Knights Radiant** were an organization of [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinders]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Their Orders were centered at [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], but they lived all across [[Alethela\|Alethela]], the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] who had to maintain the arts of war. They considered it their duty and privilege to stay vigilant for [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. It is commonly believed that they betrayed mankind on the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]], and were then referred to as the **Lost Radiants**. Their symbol was a golden hourglass shape, of eight spheres connected with two at the center. The [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] call them **Neshua Kadal**; Radiant Knight.

## History
>“*They were a solution, a way to offset the destruction of the Desolations. Ten orders of knights, founded with the purpose of helping men fight, then rebuild.*”
\-Dalinar's visions[5]

The first Surgebinders came to be as a result of [[Spren\|spren]] trying to imitate what [[Honor\|Honor]] had given his [[Herald\|Heralds]]. The spren formed bonds with the mankind to give them [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities. Honor was surprised by their coming, because he hadn't taught it to his Heralds. These Surgebinders were later formed into the ten orders of the Knights Radiant by the Herald [[Ishar\|Ishi'Elin]], for the purpose of watching for the coming Desolations, and helping men fight, then rebuild the society from the destruction of the Desolations, and they adopted the city of Urithiru as their center of power. For a long time, they maintained their duty, until eventually they abandoned it on what is now known as the Day of Recreance, and possibly even turned against their wards, as some legends say. This betrayal caused many spren to die, their [[Shardblade\|corpses]] becoming tools of destruction, and as a result they stopped granting humanity Surgebinding.
In recent times, sensing an impending danger, the spren started returning to mankind as an act of self-preservation. People all over Roshar started gaining Surgebinding powers by forming Nahel bonds with the spren in the following years. At the beginning of the year 1174, Urithiru was reclaimed, and the Knights Radiant were re-founded with initially four members; [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], and [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]].

## Radiant Orders and Powers
 by  Isaac Stewart  Symbols of the Ten Radiant Orders and their Surges
The Knights Radiant comprised ten different Orders, some of which had several hundred members. Each Order had two [[Surge\|Surges]] associated with it, and each Surge was used by two different Orders. Scholars associated the ten Orders with the [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]] as well.
Each order corresponded to a Herald, and all of them except the Bondsmiths roughly correspond to an [[Unmade\|Unmade]], though it is not entirely a one to one relationship.











The Knights Radiant also used [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], which were etched with glyphs and glowed a different color according to the Order they were a part of. Not all Radiants have access to Shards and many Orders don't receive them until they have sworn the higher Ideals.

## Squires
Many orders of the knights are able to grant the ability to use [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and some of their [[Surgebinding\|Surges]] to people, possibly those capable of becoming knights themselves. It appears that potential squires must have a mindset that matches at least partly with the requirements of the order. For [[Order of Windrunners\|Windrunners]] this appears to be a mental state geared to protection. Many squires recite the First Ideal before gaining Surgebinding, but this is not required. Each order follows a path and with a Knight willing to help the first steps can be taken before Bonding a [[Spren\|spren]] themselves. This shows the spren what people are good candidates for each order, and reducing the chance that a spren will die from failed oaths. Time as a Squire also allows a person to practice Surgebinding before gaining a Nahel bond.
It is possible for a person to remain a squire their whole life, or to be a squire of one order and bond a spren from another. Using a mix of other [[Investiture\|Investiture]] (such as [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] and [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]), a Surgebinder could hack the magic and be a squire of multiple Orders at once.
The powers of a squire are tied to a particular Radiant and their spren, and without their presence, a squire cannot draw in Stormlight to Surgebind, even if another full Knight of the same order is present. Squires must be within approximately fifty miles of their Radiant to use their powers, although they begin to weaken once they are separated by thirty miles or more. While it has been said that some orders may not have squires, the [[Order of Windrunners\|Windrunners]], [[Order of Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]], [[Order of Dustbringers\|Dustbringers]], [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweavers]], [[Order of Willshapers\|Willshapers]], [[Order of Stonewards\|Stonewards]], and [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Bondsmiths]] are known to have squires.

>“*Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.*”
\-The First Ideal of the Knights Radiant


 by  Antti Hakosaari  Knights Radiant heading into battle
The Ideals of the Knights Radiant, known as the **Immortal Words**, serve as a guide for the Radiants actions and lives. Each order of Radiants has five Ideals, though different Radiants from the same order may swear an ideal with slightly different words and Lightweavers swear more individualized truths instead of ideals. The wording of the First Ideal, however, is exact and is used by all orders, including the Lightweavers. It acts as a motto and guide for the Radiants as a whole, and is known as the Ideal of Radiance by the Skybreakers, who may have carried the name over from the ancient Radiants. The unique Ideals of each order are designed as a progression that develops a Radiant's character toward the central concepts of their order. The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] have some discretion in deciding whether or not a Radiant has progressed enough that their oath can be accepted, though this discretion appears to be limited. It is unclear whether or not the Stormfather had this ability prior to Honor's Splintering, but it seems likely it was instead Honor's decision at this time.
As a Radiant swears additional Ideals, they gain their Shardblade and Shardplate (though the Ideal at which these are received is not the same for all orders) and become more efficient in their use of Stormlight. Additionally, some orders cannot use one of their Surges until they swear a higher Ideal. Swearing the Fifth Ideal, also known as the Final Ideal, makes the Nahel bond between Radiant and spren so strong that it can only be broken by death; until that point, there are apparently safe ways to break the bond. Swearing the Fifth Ideal is generally not necessary to be considered a full Knight Radiant and is such a difficult process that the Order of the Skybreakers has not had someone swear the Fifth Ideal for centuries.
Ideals must be sworn in order, even if a Radiant is ready to swear a higher ideal than the one they cannot currently swear.

## Vorinism
In [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], the fall of the Knights Radiant was called the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]].
Vorinism taught that the Knights Radiant betrayed the people. It was taught that their powers were not real, but elaborate tricks, and that they only pretended to have a holy calling. The "evidence" for this was that the powers could not be reproduced.

## Trivia
Brandon intended for sets of Ideals across Orders (e.g. the Third Ideal) to have a theme, though not all oaths will follow the pattern.
