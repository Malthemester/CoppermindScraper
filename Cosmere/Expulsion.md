The **Expulsion** is an ancient event in pre-[[Roshar\|Rosharan]] history.

## Vorin Doctrine
In [[Vorin\|Vorin]] mythology, it marks the defeat of the population of the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]] and their exile to [[Roshar\|Roshar]] by the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]. Following the Expulsion, the Voidbringers followed mankind to Roshar and the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] began. It is unclear why the humans lost the war in the Tranquiline Halls or how they traveled from there to Roshar.

## Historicity
>“* They came from another world, using powers that we have been forbidden to touch. Dangerous powers, of spren and Surges. They destroyed their lands and have come to us begging. *”
\-From the Eila Stele[2]

The humans who first settled on Roshar arrived from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]]--another inner planet in the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]]. While the exact reason for their migration is unknown, [[Honor\|Honor]] implied that they needed a new home after destroying their previous planet with the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshards]]. The [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]], an ancient [[Singer\|singer]] text, claimed that the humans were welcomed to Roshar by their gods despite access to "dangerous powers, of [[Spren\|spren]] and [[Surge\|Surges]]." The stele further claimed that the humans had betrayed them, as subjects of their own god--[[Odium\|Odium]], and ultimately implied that the humans themselves were the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]], come to conquer Roshar. The myth of the Expulsion seems to be based on these events.
