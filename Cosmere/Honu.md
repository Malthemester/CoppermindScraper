**Honu** is a type of [[Lavis\|lavis]] grain liquor on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
In late 1173, during the [[Weeping\|Weeping]] at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], [[Zahel\|Zahel]] drank from a bottle of hard honu while he talked to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] about washing the sand in the lighteyed dueling grounds.
The existence of "hard" honu implies that there may be several different types of honu with a variety of alcoholic strengths. Lavis grows throughout Roshar and can also be used to make beer.
