## Geography
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] Jah Keved on the world map
Located in eastern Roshar, Jah Keved is the second largest state on the planet, claiming over five and a half million square kilometers of land. It shares its eastern border with [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]] on three rivers, while in the west, it is bordered by [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]] and [[Triax\|Triax]]. North to south, the country stretches across the entire continent, between the [[Reshi Sea\| Reshi]] and [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat]] Seas.
Though verdant, Jah Keved doesn't possess many major rivers. The country's most notable geographical feature are the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] in the east, which form an important strategic barrier against the Alethi.

### Notable Locations

[[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] - Massive mountains on the eastern side of the country, the Peaks are the home of the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] people. Despite their high altitude, the mountaintops are habitable thanks to a series of hot lakes known as the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]].
[[Bavland\|Bavland]] - A small mining region, known for being dusty.

[[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] - The capital city of Jah Keved. Much of it was destroyed during the civil war of 1173. It is the site of the country's [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]].
[[Valath\|Valath]] - The location of the Holy Enclave, the center of Vorin faith.
[[Silnasen\|Silnasen]] - The main city of the Siln people.
[[Northgrip\|Northgrip]] - The largest city located on the northern coast.

[[Silent Mount\|The Silent Mount]] - A mountain where the [[Vanrial\|Vanrial]], an order of artists, live.
[[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] - Roshar's only stable [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]], located somewhere in the Horneater Peaks.
[[Jokasha Monastery\|Jokasha Monastery]] - Home of the Vorin Devotary of the Mind.
## History
 by  Isaac Stewart  Ancient [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]]
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, the territory now occupied by Jah Keved belonged to the kingdom of [[Valhav\|Valhav]]. Since that time, the countries of [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]] and [[Triax\|Triax]] have splintered off, though Jah Keved still holds vast majority of Valhav lands, including what was presumably its capital, [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], along with its [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]].
For a long time, Jah Keved was the largest country on Roshar. After [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] unified [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] into a single state, the Veden fought a number of small border wars against the Alethi, attempting to test their defenses. Though they were eventually pushed back by the forces led by [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], small conflicts between Alethi and Veden highprinces continued for many years. Nonetheless, the country remained the main oasis of stability in the region.
This changed, however, in the year 1173, when [[Szeth\|Szeth]] assassinated the Veden king, [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]], along with a number of highprinces. This plunged the country into a chaotic civil war, with at least seven different factions hoping to claim Vedenar and crown their leader king. The situation was further worsened by the presence of the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]], known better as the Thrill, leading Veden soldiers to fight with unprecedented degree of drive and brutality.
The civil war lasted for a few months, with the final confrontation being the battle at Vedenar. Highprince [[Valam\|Valam]] emerged victorious, becoming the new king. However, he quickly passed the crown to king [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] before ordering his illegitimate son, [[Redin\|Redin]], to kill him. Given Valam's poor health and his insinuations shortly before his death, it's possible he was being poisoned by the [[Diagram (group)\| Diagram]] to achieve this, as it was them who instigated the civil war by sending Szeth.
Under Taravangian's leadership, Jah Keved was, alongside [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], the first country to ally with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Fearing that it would be overrun by [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]], the king requested - and was granted - aid from other members of the coalition.. However, following the revelations of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]], the country broke off from the alliance as part of [[Diagram (group)\| Diagram's]] plan to undermine Dalinar.
Though king Taravangian pledged himself to [[Odium\|Odium]], Jah Keved was not part of his deal. However after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] Taravangian began preparing Jah Keved to switch sides. He did this by promoting people Odium could control, putting his troops into position to betray [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] ,and subtly indicating to his followers that the war was a problem for Alithkar and Azir. When Taravangian gave the order the Vedens turned on the [[Coalition of monarchs\|Coalition of monarchs]] and joined Odium. 

## Politics
### Government
Much like [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] or [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], the population of Jah Keved is divided into [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] and [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]], with the latter holding power. A number of weaker, lower-[[Dahn\|dahn]] noble houses owe fealty to a group of [[Highprince\|Highprinces]], who in turn owe fealty to a king. Prior to the civil war, known Veden Highprinces were [[Valam\|Valam]], [[Abrial\|Abrial]], [[Boriar\|Boriar]], [[Evinor\|Evinor]] and [[Jal Mala\|Jal Mala]].
Over the year 1173, most of the country's political structures have either fallen into chaos or outright disintegrated. Opening with the death of the then-king [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]] at the hands of the [[Szeth\|Assassin in White]], the ensuing civil war has claimed the lives of all the Veden Highprinces, either through assassination or open warfare. The nominal victor of the war, [[Valam\|Valam]], passed the Veden crown to king [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] of Kharbranth, who has a claim to the throne through his mother.
Following the civil war, Taravangian appointed two new highprinces to replace the ones lost. The two men are brothers, the elder of which is named Nan [[Urian\|Urian]].

### International relations
As the largest country prior to the unification of Alethkar, Jah Keved has strong influence on the culture of other [[Vorin\|Vorin]] states. The centre of Vorin church, the Holy Enclave, is located in the Veden city of [[Valath\|Valath]]. Valath is also the location of one of Roshar's major [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] hubs, adding to the city's importance.
In the decades prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Jah Keved fought a number of small border wars against [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. Though they were initially pushed back out of Alethi territory by forces led by [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], the skirmishes and battles between Veden and Alethi highprinces continued for over a decade. Despite that, the two kingdoms appear to have good diplomatic relations, and a marriage between their [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] isn't seen as anything out of the ordinary.

### Military
>‚Äú* We talk of Jah Keved's weakness, but that‚Äôs relative. They still have a huge standing army, strong fortifications. If the enemy wades into Jah Keved now, while solidifying their own power, it will drain their resources and stall their conquest.*‚Äù
\- Dalinar Kholin on the Veden military[20]


Though not as militaristic as their eastern neighbors, Jah Keved is thought to possess the most [[Shardwielding\|Shards]] of any country other than Alethkar, including about twenty [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]].
Prior to the civil war, each Veden highprince maintained their own military. However, it appears that following Taravangian's crowning, the surviving units have all been folded under his command. As the last battle was fought over [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], most of Veden troops are stationed in storm bunkers at the city's outskirts. The civil war was catastrophic for them - many units suffered over 50% casualties - yet even with those losses the Veden military boasts an enormous number of soldiers and powerful fortifications. Entering their territory without sufficient preparations is generally considered to be a horrid idea bound to mire the potential assailant in years-long conflict, and a massive drain on resources.
Jah Keved is known for their raiding tactics. The army operates in smaller raider groups, about four thousand strong, backed by a powerful main force. Those raiders are highly mobile, capable of harrying the enemy while avoiding direct confrontation. Their generals are noted to be excellent, even by [[Alethi\|Alethi]] standards.
A major focus of the Veden strategy is the defense of the strip of land between [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] and Alethkar. Though narrow and underpopulated, it's a verdant, rich land that can be used as a staging area for any invasion of Jah Keved.
Following the fall of central and northern Alethkar to the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]], large number of Alethi soldiers withdrew to either Jah Keved or [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]] in hopes of escaping the flying [[Fused\|Fused]].

## Culture
 by  Dan dos Santos  Veden man wearing the latest fashion
Jah Keved is comprised of at least four distinct ethnic groups - Veden, [[Silnasen\|Siln]], [[Bavland\|Bav]] and [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]].

### Veden
>‚Äú*While your food sits well in my stomach, the amount of bowing and scraping you show ardents made me uncomfortable.*‚Äù
\-Kabsal on the people of Jah Keved[26]


The Veden people are typically associated with pale skin and violet eyes. Their language belongs to the Vorin family, and is close enough to that of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] to be mutually intelligible for both sides. The Alethi are also close to Vedens in fashion.
The Veden are by and large [[Vorin\|Vorin]], worshipping the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] and the [[Herald\|Heralds]]. They appear to be more religious than average Vorins, with higher importance being placed on the trappings of the faith, such as the [[Safehand\|safehand]] and the strict division between masculine and feminine arts. In particular, they are noted to be highly respectful and reverent of the [[Ardent\|ardents]], and extremely traditional in the particulars of the doctrine.
In Veden families, the sons have two-part names, with the latter part being their given name, while the former references their order or birth. The first four sons are called **Nan**, **Tet**, **Asha** and **Van**. Should one of the sons die or be disinherited, his younger brothers all move up a level; for example, Tet [[Balat\|Balat]] becomes Nan Balat. The numerals are used mainly in formal context; siblings usually drop them when talking among themselves.
When a Veden couple marries, the spouses retain their family names. The children of the couple all use the surname of only one parent; it's unclear whether it's always the father's, or if it depends on the parents' relative [[Dahn\|dahns]].

### Siln and Bav
The Siln people live in and around the southern city of [[Silnasen\|Silnasen]]. They are noted as being less technologically advanced than the rest of the country, with highly ritualized warfare. Their apparent independence from Veden rule may stem from the fact that they were once a sovereign city-state.
The Bav people live in [[Bavland\|Bavland]], a small region in the south-western corner of the country. They are mostly miners, and have their own language and culture largely separate from that of the Veden.

### Unkalaki
For more information on the Unkalaki people, see [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]].
The Unkalaki - or Horneaters, as they are called by outsiders - live on top of the mountains known as [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]]. They are one of several peoples with [[Singer\|Singer]] ancestry, and have some attributes that set them apart from other Rosharan humans, such as their unusually strong teeth (which is where the "Horneater" nickname comes from) and the ability to occasionally hear the Rhythms. Red hair is also a typically Unkalaki feature, and are a mark of Horneater ancestry on a person from outside the Peaks.
Though the Horneater Peaks are nominally part of Jah Keved, the Unkalaki have their own language, system of beliefs and government, and don't seem to see themselves as Veden citizens. However, the Veden still claim the right to levy troops from among them in times of war.
