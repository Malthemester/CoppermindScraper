The **lanceryn** (singular: lancer) are a type of [[Greatshell\|greatshell]] native to [[Aimia\|Aimia]].
The lanceryn were originally the **Ancient Guardians** or **Guardians of Ancient Sins**, tasked with the keeping of the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] underneath [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. Like all greatshells, the lanceryn were enormous. It is likely they could fly and bonded [[Mandra\|mandras]]. They, like the modern larkin, had the ability to feed on [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. At the fall of their species, the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] took over their role protecting the Dawnshard. Some hordelings had bred with lanceryn prior to their fall, thus passing on the ability to feed on Investiture, albeit in a limited manner.
It is commonly believed that the lanceryn died off during the [[Scouring of Aimia\|scouring of Aimia]], to the dismay of those who had harvested their [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]]. They were the last creature known to produce gemhearts of large size prior to the discovery of the [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. However, it appears that the lanceryn live on in some way in [[Larkin\|larkin]]. The [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] [[Nikliasorm\|Nikliasorm]] believes that [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri]], a larkin, is an Ancient Guardian in her own right. It also says that lanceryn are now called larkin. They are "kind of the same species." Although there is some relationship between the two, it is unclear as of yet exactly what that relationship is.
In the undersea caverns of Aimia, there is a room containing six greatshell skulls made of carapace, presumably belonging to lanceryn. They appear to turn to face [[Rysn\|Rysn]] while she is in a nearby cavern.
