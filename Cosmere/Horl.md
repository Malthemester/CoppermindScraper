>“*Well? You've threatened violence against me. Come. Hit me. Rob me. Do it knowing I've lived among you almost my entire life. Do it knowing that I've healed your children. Come in. Bleed one of your own!*”
\-Lirin to Horl and the other robbers[1]


**Horl** is a resident of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
In 1167, Horl, [[Balsas\|Balsas]], [[Luten\|Luten]] and others tried to rob [[Lirin\|Lirin]] of the [[Sphere\|spheres]] he got from Brightlord [[Wistiow\|Wistiow]]. Brightlord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] had convinced them that Lirin had stolen the spheres. Horl and the others were caught by Lirin outside his home, where he confronted them, shaming them for their behavior. Despite the black mask that Horl was wearing, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] recognized him by his broad shoulders. Once they were caught by Lirin, Horl and the rest left Lirin's home, ashamed.
