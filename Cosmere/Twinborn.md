A **Twinborn** is a [[Metalborn\|Metalborn]] with at least one [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] power and one [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] power.
Notable Twinborn included [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]], and [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]].
Twinborn only began to appear after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]], due to the intermingling of the [[Terris\|Terris]] people with the other citizens of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. This mingling also had the effect of diluting Feruchemical power, creating [[Ferring\|Ferrings]]. The interaction of Feruchemy and [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] in a single person allows for practical benefits of the power ([[Gold\|Bloodmakers]] healing in a time bubble, [[Coinshot\|Coinshots]] augmenting their weight with Feruchemical [[Iron\|iron]]), etc.
It should be noted however, that it is difficult to be born a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] and full Feruchemist. This is due to fact that they share portions of the individual's "spiritual DNA", thus making a full manifestation of both abilities almost completely impossible. Whether this means someone can be born a full Mistborn and Ferring or full Feruchemist and Misting is yet to be determined.

## Compounding
For more information, see [[Compounding\|Compounding]].
If the Twinborn is fortunate enough to obtain the Allomantic and Feruchemical abilities of the same metal, they can practice [[Compounding\|Compounding]]. Initially seen in The Final Empire, the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] is able to compound all the metals (as a result of his Terris birth and later giving himself Allomancy). After the Lord Ruler's death, [[Sazed\|Sazed]] theorizes about his ability to use [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] together which therefore granted him the ability to rapidly heal, maintain a young age and be amazingly strong. Compounding was a one-time occurrence during the time of the Lord Ruler due to the fact that Feruchemists and Allomancers did not commonly mix sexually (a strict breeding program was enforced on the Terris people) and therefore could not genetically mix the powers. Compounding is seen throughout [[Alloy of Law\|Alloy of Law]] in the case of [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] and his extraordinary ability to heal by compounding [[Gold\|gold]] due to being born a Bloodmaker and an Augur.
Compounding involves storing a Feruchemical attribute in a metalmind, then burning the metalmind Allomantically. This in effect creates a "new metal". Brandon explained, "In compounding, when you have the power of both Allomancy and Feruchemy, you draw power from [[Preservation\|Preservation]] through the metal and it recognizes the power that is already stored--"Oh, this is healing, I know how to do that‚Äù--and so you get the power of Feruchemy but boosted by energy from the other place. This is how the Lord Ruler achieved immortality." The Lord Ruler Compounded atium, which stores Youth, in order to stay alive for hundreds of years. It is also likely he Compounded gold, as it is stated that he has survived decapitation and flaying, as well as getting impaled just before he kills [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]]. Similarly, Miles 'Hundred-Lives' Dagouter Compounded gold (Health), getting near infinite amounts of Healing.

## Classification
Just as individuals with only one Allomantic or Feruchemical power have a special name (i.e. Coinshot, Archivist), each combination of Twinborn has one as well. At this time, only the combination of Crasher (Coinshot and Skimmer) is known in the books. However, [[Wayne\|Wayne]] claims to know the names for each of them. Excluding the [[God Metal\|God Metals]], which have faded into legends by the time of Wax and Wayne, this makes for a total of 256 possible combinations.
