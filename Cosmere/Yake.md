**Yake** is a member of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
He participates in the first bridge run [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] actively leads, and with [[Dunny\|Dunny]] & [[Malop\|Malop]] are the last to arrive to the bridge. After [[Gaz\|Gaz]] changes Bridge Four to be on chasm duty, and some of the bridgemen start talking to one another in the chasms, Yake is amongst those who stay quiet but take notice of the camaraderie. He is wounded in the arm during one bridge run, leaving Bridge Four only twenty-eight capable members. When [[Maps\|Maps]] dies, he dismisses the [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattle]] as "just dying delirium".
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] is training Bridge Four how to fight with the spear, he sends [[Moash\|Moash]] to help Yake and [[Hobber\|Hobber]] with their thrusts.
Yake, Moash, [[Teft\|Teft]] and Kaladin train with [[Zahel\|Zahel]] and [[Ivis\|Ivis]], learning how to deal with [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and use [[Stances\|stances]].
He is among Kaladin's [[Squire\|squires]] during a training session and greets [[Rlain\|Rlain]] and suggests he try to educate the new recruits, and then queried him about the [[Fused\|Fused]] attacking caravans.
