**Yis** is an [[Iriali\|Iriali]] leatherworker on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He works in the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]].

## Appearance and Personality
He has yellow eyes and golden hair with a metallic sheen. He wears his hair short and covers it with a cap to avoid attention. He seems to have some level of education, as he exhibits a relatively large vocabulary.

## History
He was one of the lead leatherworkers in [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] warcamp. [[Adolin\|Adolin]] consulted Yis and his colleague, [[Avaran\|Avaran]], during the investigation into [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] broken saddle strap. Adolin showed Yis and Avaran the strap, and they agreed that it was sliced rather than torn. [[Janala\|Janala]] briefly interrupted, later calling the leatherworking shop "stinky". Yis and Avaran did not confirm Elhokar's theory that someone cut the strap intentionally, since they had seen similar cuts caused by loose buckles or improper storage. Adolin later visited more leatherworkers, and most of them agreed with Yis and Avaran's findings.
