**Cadmium** is the external temporal pulling metal. An [[Allomancy\|Allomancer]] burning cadmium is able to stretch time in a bubble around them, making it pass more slowly. Feruchemists can use cadmium to store breath, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, cadmium steals Temporal Allomantic powers.

## Allomantic Use
A cadmium [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Pulser**. Burning cadmium pulls on time around the user, causing time to pass more slowly in a bubble around them. Events outside the bubble appear to move much faster to someone inside.
When a cadmium bubble and a [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] bubble occur in the same place, their effects cancel out resulting in no change whilst still burning the metals used. The time bubble created by a Pulser is about the size of a room, larger than a time bubble created by burning bendalloy. Careful examination may reveal the edge of the bubble, where air appears to shimmer.
When a time bubble is created, the area of the bubble stays stationary with respect to a moving object as long as the Pulser creating it is stationed on an object large enough. For example, someone standing on a planet, which is quite massive, is still actually moving with the rotation of the planet, and the bubble moves with that person, but the bubble itself stays in the same place with respect to the planet. However, if the Pulser who created a time bubble is on a small, moving object (or the person merely walks to the edge of the bubble), the Pulser will be transported through the bubble, "popping" it. Objects entering or exiting the bubble are thrown wildly off-course, most likely because different parts of the object are moving at different speeds during the transition. When leaving the bubble, time bubbles interfere with almost all forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. When multiple bubbles occur in the same space their effects are multiplied.
Some potential "non-combative" uses for cadmium Allomancy include advancing personal time to a desired date, performance art in which one or more performers utilize cadmium "pulses" to enhance the exhibition, and scientific observation of processes/reactions which would otherwise not be observable in real-time. Cadmium is involved in multiple ways with faster-than-light travel.
Time bubbles can be popped by [[Aluminum\|aluminum]].

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of cadmium needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, they would be able to slow time to a greater degree than a regular Misting. They would be able to anchor the bubble to themselves, allowing the bubble to move with them. This would cause complications for objects moving in and out of the bubble as energy is transferred to and from the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] to prevent redshift and blueshift. They would also be able to influence the size of the bubble and the amount of time it gives.

## Feruchemical Use
A cadmium [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Gasper**. Cadmium is used to store breath. While storing breath, the Gasper must hyperventilate to keep their body oxygenated. Tapping a cadmiummind allows the user to go without breathing, or to introduce extra oxygen into their bloodstream.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, cadmium steals Temporal Allomantic powers (cadmium, [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]], [[Gold\|gold]], and [[Electrum\|electrum]]).

## History
During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], cadmium and [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] were inaccessible and unknown to Allomancers, though they were possibly known to the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. The fact that their technology couldn't create the metals made Mistings of these types impossible to discover. After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], advancement in technology eventually made the metals available.
