A **zinkall**, plural **zinkallin**, is a ranged weapon used by [[Dayside\|Daysiders]] on [[Taldain\|Taldain]].

## Characteristics
A zinkall looks like a set of thin reed-like pipes held together with rope. It is mounted on the forearm, near the wrist. There are usually four or five tubes, although some zinkallin may have many more. Each tube contains a small arrow that can be launched by the wielder of the zinkall by releasing compressed air, pushing the arrow out of the tube at high speed. The arrows can be carved from sandling carapace, making them [[Terken\|terken]], and they usually have fletching on the back of their shafts. A zinkall can be used in very close quarters, and the arrows can be fired in rapid succession. They appear to be quite accurate, although proficiency may take some practice. The exact range of a zinkall is unknown, but they appear to be able to fire at least a hundred yards.
Zinkallin are common weapons on Dayside. They are seen used by [[Kerzta\|Kerztian]] warrior-priests, [[Lossand\|Lossandin]] [[Trackt\|trackts]], and members of [[Sharezan\|Sharezan's]] gang. Most users wield a single zinkall, presumably to allow the use of a melee weapon in their other hand. Extra arrows can be carried in a small quiver attached to a belt or sling. In some nations of [[Darkside\|Darkside]], they have been made obsolete by the discovery of gunpowder.

## History
Zinkallin are seen many times during the events that led to [[Kenton\|Kenton]] becoming [[Lord Mastrell\|Lord Mastrell]]. They were used by the Kerztians in their attack on the [[Diem\|Diem]], by both [[Lokmlen\|Lokmlen]] and [[Ais\|Ais]] during their fight in the market, and by several assassins who tried to kill Kenton.
[[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]] found the weapons interesting and noted that they operated on the same basic principles as a pistol.
[[Tain\|Tain]] gave Ais a defective zinkall before luring her into a trap.
