## Geography
As a whole, the islands are vaguely shaped like the USA, part of Canada and Mexico. A few islands are roughly outlined like the states, as in the case of Idaho or Texas, but most bear no resemblance to their namesakes.

## Infrastructure
Aside from streets there were [[Springrail\|springrails]] for movement over greater distances. Even different islands are connected with springrail routes.

## History
There's not much known about the ancient history of the United Isles. When the [[JoSeun\|JoSeun]] conquered [[Britannia\|Britannia]], many refugees, including King [[Gregory III\|Gregory III]], fled to the United Isles.

## Culture
Little culture is referenced or explained, but the people of the United Isles seem to be focused and content. There seems to be much class division between the rich and the poor. The people seem to be kept uninformed about what is going on in some of the other islands, most notably Nebrask.
English is the official language of the United Isles, though there seems to be Spanish, French, and Portuguese-dominated islands.

## Religion
The main religion is the [[Church of the Monarch\|Church of the Monarch]]. It is closely associated with [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatics]] because the inception ceremony grants a Rithmatist his or her powers.
