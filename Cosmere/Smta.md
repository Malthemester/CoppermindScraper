**Smta** is a ship's captain on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is a tall [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] woman with curled eyebrows that match her hair.
In late 1174, she was the captain of a military ship; her crew included [[Yalb\|Yalb]], [[Brekv\|Brekv]], and [[Dok\|Dok]]. Yalb notes that he is loyal to her because she was good to take him in spite of the rumours about him and the *Wind's Pleasure*. After Yalb spotted the crewless *First Dreams*, Smta directed him to lead a boarding party due to his "special experience". Yalb knew that Smta would want to bring the ship home to help with the war effort.
