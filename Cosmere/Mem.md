## Appearance and Personality
She appreciates Mraize's refined manner and his taste in clothing, and enjoys the fact that he does not require her to use a servant's entrance. She believes that the notion of servants being "invisible" is a fallacy since they are usually closely watched by the house steward and their master's guests, and notes that [[Ghostbloods\|Mraize's associates]] are particulary wary. She enjoys her work and finds it fulfilling, since there will always be a need for clean clothes.

>“*The need for clean clothing outlived disasters. The end of the world could come, but that would only mean more bloodstains to wash.*”
\-Mem[1]


## History
Mem was quite skilled at the art of doing laundry, with knowledge of many different dyes, fabrics, and cleaners. She washed clothes at a central location in [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] with other washwomen. Mem successfully cleaned a particularly tough stain from the [[Mycalin\|Mycalin]]-dyed pants of Mraize's [[Azish\|Azish]] cavalrylord's suit; she thought the stain was a combination of oil and blood, but Mraize referred to it as "[[Aether\|aether]]". She earned herself a three-[[Sphere\|firemark]] bonus and high praise from Mraize.

>“* Mem, you are an absolute genius. Not every hunter carries a spear, and this is proof indeed.*”
\- Mraize, after Mem cleans the aether from his pants[1]


She briefly had [[Pom\|Pom]] as an assistant, and thought she was surprisingly beautiful for a washgirl. She was flabbergasted when Pom destroyed one of Mraize's paintings, as she was not aware of Pom's true identity.

## Trivia
She is a cameo for Emily Grange.
