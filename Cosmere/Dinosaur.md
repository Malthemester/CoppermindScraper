**Dinosaurs** are a sapient species in the [[Free Kingdoms\|Free Kingdoms]]. They are native to [[Nalhalla\|Nalhalla]].
They are much smaller than the dinosaurs that presumably lived in the [[Hushlands\|Hushlands]] millions of years ago, with Tyrannosaurus Rex reaching five to six feet tall. They also have varying coloration (green, orange, etc). They wear trousers and speak with a Nalhallan (British in Hushlands) accent. The majority of them appear to be refined, calm, and well-mannered, sometimes to a fault, which is why they are considered to be useless in a crisis situation.
The [[Librarian\|Librarians]] in the Hushlands execute dinosaurs, enlarge their bones and place them into rock formations for archaeologists to dig up, perpetuating the lie that dinosaurs were prehistoric creatures.

## Trivia
Dinosaurs were originally said to speak with a [[Melerand\|Melerandian]] accent, but the name of Melerand was changed to Nalhalla in later editions of the book.
