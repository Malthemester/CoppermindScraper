## Abilities and Weaknesses
Lightweaving allows for the creation of optical and auditory illusions. Lightweavers can use this to make disguises, and is able to produce light. It could also make illusions in smoke such as making images of [[Derethil\|people]] and [[Wandersail\|ships]]. All illusion magic will work in a similar manner. Illusion magic is capable of creating auditory and visual manifestations either independent of a Lightweaver (i.e. fixed in place) or linked to a host. Both require a steady source of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. These manifestations are linked to a person's mind and are largely a mental creation having no physical mass. They are capable of movement. However this is more complicated than a static image and requires greater mental control to function. The range of an image is limited to its proximity to a source of Investiture. As the Lightweaver moves away from an image it will begin to blur and then dissolve when its connection is broken. Increased focus on the part of a Lightweaver can increase the range but not greatly. Lightweaving would be affected by aphantasia.
Lightweaving does not always seem to function perfectly on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Their powers on the [[Shardworld\|shardworld]] can be limited, and they can have trouble making some aspects of the magic work, even after multiple attempts. It is uncertain why this occurs and whether or not this issue is unique to Roshar.

### Interactions with Rosharan Lightweaving
Yolish Lightweaving is much less restrictive than the later Rosharan variant, and does not require a [[Spren\|spren]] or [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to function. Yolish Lightweaving does not always seem to function perfectly on Roshar, and Yolish Lightweavers may need help from Rosharan Lightweavers to fully craft an illusion. A Yolish Lightweaver may be able to guide a Rosharan Lightweaver's power.
Gaining Rosharan Lightweaving allows for some supplemental ability with Yolish Lightweaving, and could allow Yolish Lightweavers to overcome the issue of crafting illusions on Roshar, although further impacts or [[Resonance\|resonances]] between the two are unknown. Yolish Lightweaving has a compounding effect with Rosharan Lightweaving, and likely allows Yolish Lightweavers to circumvent the problems they can experience with Yolish Lightweaving.
