The **Physical Realm** is the realm of existence in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] that contains what is perceivable to the physical senses. Of the three [[Realmatic Theory\|Realms]], it is the most readily understood, as it behaves in much the same way as our universe does.
Most of the cosmere stories so far take place almost exclusively in the Physical Realm. These stories are set on planets orbiting stars that are part of a small cluster within a dwarf galaxy.
This article lists all the known celestial bodies in the cosmere as they appear in the Physical Realm, including planets, stars and moons.

10 Notes


## The Selish System

The Selish system orbits a yellow star named [[Mashe\|Mashe]]. There are five planets in this system: two within the habitable zone, then two gas giants named Ky and Ralen, and finally an unnamed dwarf planet.

### Donne
Donne is the closest planet to the sun. While it is in a habitable region, it is barren and suffers from terrible dust storms.

### Sel

The second planet from the sun, Sel is an Earth-like Shardworld inhabited by humans and artificially created beings called [[Seon\|seons]] and [[Skaze\|skaze]]. The planet was the location of [[Elantris (book)\|Elantris]]. Sel was dominated by the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]], with [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and [[Teod\|Teod]] being the only remaining free nations. All these nations (except Teod which is located on a continent to the north) were situated on the continent of Opelon (named Sycla by the Fjordell Empire).


Sel has a single moon named Oem.

## The Scadrian System

The Scadrian system has a yellow sun. It has five planets: Scadrial within the system's habitable zone; two gas giants, named Aagal Nod and Aagal Uch; and finally two unnamed dwarf planets.

### Scadrial

The planet was created by the Shards [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. The orbit of the planet has been changed by people using [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Its size and gravitation are 1.0 cosmere standard.

## The Taldain System

The Taldain system is a binary system. The two stars in it are a weak white dwarf star surrounded by a particulate ring and a blue-white supergiant.

### Taldain

Taldain is a tidally locked planet. It is the only planet in this system.

## The Threnodite System

This planetary system has four planets. The habitable zone has three planets named Monody, Elegy, and Threnody. Elegy has a single moon named Coronach. Beyond the habitable zone is a single gas giant named Purity.

### Threnody

Threnody, the third planet in the Threnodite system, is the minor Shardworld that contains the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]]. It is the setting for the story [[Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell\|Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell]]. It has many features that are similar to Earth, including forests, mountains and oceans. Silver seems to be a fairly common resource on the planet, but because of its importance to survival, it is still finite and valuable. It has no moon.

## The Drominad System

The Drominad system has seven planets. There are four planets in the habitable zone, three of which have developed human societies. An asteroid belt lies just beyond these planets. Then there are three gas giants. All these planets are named for their position from the sun (First of the Sun, Second of the Sun, etc.).

### First of the Sun

First of the Sun is a minor world consisting mainly of an large ocean and island systems. It has no shards residing on it.


First of the Sun has a single moon named First of the First.

## The Rosharan System

Greater Roshar is a planetary system containing thirteen planets. Some have life, sentient and not, others are barren. There are three planets in the habitable region and ten gas giants. The gas giants are named after Vorin numerals.

### Ashyn

Ashyn is a minor shardworld that has sentient life. It is the first planet from the system's sun.
The book [[The Silence Divine\|The Silence Divine]] is set here. The magic system involves people who gain magical powers from diseases.
Ashyn is mostly barren, with a few fertile patches. It currently has no [[Shard\|shard]].

### Roshar

Roshar is the second planet from the Rosharan system's sun. It has a gravity of 0.7, a year 500 days long, with each year being 1.1 earth years. The planet consists of one large super continent.


Roshar has three moons. The first moon is Salas. It is violet, and is the smallest moon. The middle moon is Nomon, which is a bright, pale blue. And the final moon is Mishim, which is small and green.

### Braize

Braize is the third planet from the sun. [[Odium\|Odium]] settled on Braize, although he is still affecting [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Braize is unlikely to get its own books, but scenes from [[The Stormlight Archive\|The Stormlight Archive]] will be set on Braize.
Braize is known to the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] people as [[Damnation\|Damnation]].

## The Nalthian System

The Nalthian system orbits a yellow star. There are three planets in the system: [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], the gas giant Farkeeper the Bright, and the dwarf planet Nightstar the Hidden. Much farther from the star, there is a comet belt. There is also a [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] Anomaly in Nalthis' orbit.

### Nalthis

On Nalthis, [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] is the capital city of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] and its bordering mountain state of [[Idris\|Idris]]. The jungles are situated in a large valley surrounded by mountains and a sea.


A single moon named Rrendos orbits the planet.

## Other Planets
### Yolen

Yolen is home to three sentient races and was the origin of all humans in the cosmere. The original sixteen Vessels were from Yolen.

### Vax

Nothing is known of Vax, its peoples, or any [[Shard\|Shards]] that may or may not be located there. All that is certain is that it has a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]].

### Obrodai

Little is known of Obrodai, but [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] has claimed it, manifested an avatar there, and warned [[Hoid\|Hoid]] against returning.

## Stars and Constellations
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]]
### Starbelt
The [[Starbelt\|Starbelt]] is an unusually bright patch of stars in the sky of [[Threnody\|Threnody]]. It is useful for navigation in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] during the night; the light usually filtered through the trees fairly well.
The Starbelt is the same patch of unusually bright stars that is visible from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is visible from other worlds in the cosmere as well.

### Taln's Scar
[[Taln's Scar\|Taln's Scar]] is a great swath of red stars that stand out against the white ones.

### The Tear
The [[Tear\|Tear]] is a particularly bright star in the Rosharan sky. It's name comes from the single tear shed by [[Reya\|Reya]] in Rosharan Mythology.

### Mashe
[[Mashe\|Mashe]] is the star around which [[Sel\|Sel]] and several other planets orbit.
