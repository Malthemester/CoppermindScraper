## History
Tozbek captains the ship *Wind's Pleasure* and is married with [[Ashlv\|Ashlv]], who sails with him. He transported [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] from [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] to [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] in her pursuit of [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] at a generously discounted price, because of [[House Davar\|House Davar's]] investments in his shipping business.

>“*Of course we'll give you passage and return to your estates. It would be my pleasure to have you aboard. We are Davar men, we are. Indebted to your family.*”
\-Captain Tozbek [3]


Jasnah selected the *Wind's Pleasure* with Tozbek and his crew for her and Shallan's voyage from Kharbranth to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Following the sinking of the *Wind's Pleasure*, Tozbek's fate is unknown.
