## Appearance and Personality
He has leathery skin, long limbs, and dark hair. He almost always maintains a relaxed posture. [[Rysn\|Rysn]] assumes that he is a [[Purelake\|Purelaker]], despite the fact that he does not mention [[Vun Makak\|Vun Makak]]. He is very easygoing, and is apathetic towards punctuality and schedules, like most Purelakers.

## Attributes and Attributes
Gu is able to speak [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] well. He also speaks at least a small amount of [[Reshi\|Reshi]], which is in the same language family as Purelake dialects. He is able to skillfully navigate the waters of the Reshi Sea without hitting any dangerous underwater trees. He paddles slowly, always on one side of the boat, yet he can keep it moving straight. He believes that the Tai-na are sapient.

## History
He guides a convoy containing [[Vstim\|Vstim's]] crew (including Rysn, [[Kylrm\|Kylrm]], and [[Nlent\|Nlent]]) to a Reshi island, riding in Rysn's boat. He notes that the islands have been harder to find recently, as they are moving in unexpected ways. He is amused when Rysn realizes that the island they are visiting is actually a massive [[Greatshell\|greatshell]], a [[Tai-na\|Tai-na]] known as [[Relu-na\|Relu-na]]. He also laughs when Rysn is embarrassed after realizing that many of the island's residents are nudists. He explains to Rysn that it is too dangerous to dock boats to a Tai-na, and that crews sleep on the open ocean and simply find the island in the morning.
