The **Kerla** is an area of desert at the center of the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. It lies to the north of [[Lossand\|Lossand]], to the east of [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]], and is separated from [[Tallon\|Tallon]], [[Nor'Tallon\|Nor'Tallon]], [[Seevis\|Seevis]], and [[Denka\|Denka]] by a mountain range. It contains the [[Mastrell's Path\|Mastrell's Path]] and the mountain [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]]. The Kerla is not considered a desert by Daysiders since [[Dorim vine\|dorim vines]] are found there.
The [[Diem\|Diem]] of the [[Sand mastery\|Sand Masters]] meets in the Kerla for training and other ceremonies. During an advancement ceremony on the Kerla, they were betrayed and many members of the Diem were massacred by [[Kerzta\|Kerztians]].
