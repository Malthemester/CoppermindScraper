This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
The **Elantris trilogy** is the unofficial title for three books set on [[Sel\|Sel]] following the [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] and the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]].


Brandon had stated a wish to release the sequel in 2015, on the tenth anniversary of *Elantris's* publication, along with a re-release of *Elantris* itself. This timeline wasn't met, as of now there has been no mention of a release date for this.
