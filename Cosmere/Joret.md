**Joret** is a [[Skybreaker\|Skybreaker]] squire under the Skybreaker masters [[Ki\|Ki]] and [[Warren\|Warren]].
He competes against [[Szeth\|Szeth]] in a martial competence test over the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], to test their ability with the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Gravitation. The squires have to throw bags of colored powder at each other and avoid being hit. Joret's tactic was to hover in one place defending a pole of bags. It didn't work well for him, as remaining still made him a target.
