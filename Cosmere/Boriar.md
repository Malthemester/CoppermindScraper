Highprince **Boriar** is a [[Highprince\|highprince]] of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]].

## History
Highprince Boriar was one of several highprinces that participated in the Veden Succession War following the assassination of King [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]] by the [[Szeth\|Assassin in White]].
One of Boriar's rivals was Highprince Valam. Boriar was likely one of the seven factions that fought for control of [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]]. Boriar was defeated and killed, although his manner of death is unknown. The newly crowned King Valam, unaware of Boriar's death, wondered what Boriar and the other highprinces would make of Valam making King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] as his heir. Taravangian informed Valam of Boriar and the other highprinces' deaths.
