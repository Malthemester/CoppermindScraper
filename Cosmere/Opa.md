**Opa** is a [[Seon\|seon]] owned by Duke [[Roial\|Roial]].
After the [[Reod\|Reod]], Roial keeps the seon at his house as it was no longer fashionable to have them. His name means "Flower," and he oversaw the gardeners of Roial's estate. He has a stern and formal voice, which [[Sarene\|Sarene]] thought might be because the people of Arelon were fearful of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantrian]] magic.
During a party, Opa reports to Roial that Lord [[Redeen\|Redeen]] fell in to the pond.
