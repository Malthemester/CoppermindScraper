**Songlings** are fist-sized creatures that live on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Biology
Songlings are shaped like a peaked disc with four arms. The arms reach out to the sides and over the body, scraping their ridged shells to make a sound. It is described as a creak or "zipping rattle". Each songling maintains its own repetitive beat and tone, and the sound is percussive rather than melodic. They also have four legs situated underneath the body. The legs are squat and can hold the animal onto a rock wall.

## Behavior
>“*But Brightness Jasnah had proven to be as elusive as a wild songling. Best to be quick.*”
\-Shallan Davar on Jasnah Kholin's propensity to leave before Shallan arrived.[3]

[[Shallan\|Shallan]] compares [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin's]] elusive nature to a songling, implying that they are difficult to catch. However, [[Balat\|Balat's]] [[Axehound\|axehound]] [[Scrak\|Scrak]] is able to catch one and eats part of it. They can be found in the brush and they may live in groups, as Shallan notes that there are sometimes "competing choruses" of wild songlings near her home in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. [[Wit\|Wit]] unsuccessfully tries to replicate the sound of a songling on his pipes. However, the songlings respond to his music, so Wit has a conversation with them; they seem to also respond to his voice.
