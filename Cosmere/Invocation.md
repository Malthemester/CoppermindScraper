**Invocation** is the equivalent of [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]] in the alternate reality with Firefight. For reasons untold, Invocation left after gifting powers to the humans. Calamity was supposed to leave as well, but he stayed, and inadvertently caused the corruption of the Epics in the "real" world. The Epics in this reality do not have this same corruption, due to the absence of Invocation.
