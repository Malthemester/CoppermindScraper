>‚Äú* Every pasture needs three things. Flocks to grow, herdsmen to tend, and watchers at the rim. We of Alethela are those watchers--the warriors who protect and fight. We maintain the terrible arts of killing, then pass them on to others when the Desolation comes.*‚Äù

Alethela's borders included the present-day countries of [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]].

## Geography
Alethela is located in eastern Roshar. It is bordered by [[Rishir\|Rishir]] to its north, [[Valhav\|Valhav]] to its west, [[Thalath\|Thalath]] to the southwest, [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]] to the south, and ocean to the east.

## History
When [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] was built, many people wanted it to be built in Alethela, but there was some unknown reason obvious to the people of the day why it couldn't happen.
By the time of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], it had become the kingdom of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. During this transition, Alethela lost territory in the west to [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], but gained some in the north from [[Rishir\|Rishir]], and in the southeast from [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. Territory was also lost in the northeast, known in the Era of Solitude as the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]].

## Culture
>‚Äú*One kingdom to study the arts of war so that the others might have peace. We die so that you may live. It has ever been our place.*‚Äù
\-An unknown female Radiant[1]


Although the orders of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] were centered in Urithiru, Alethela was their home, and Radiants lived in cities throughout the nation, crossing borders to fight. The [[Order of Windrunners\|Order of Windrunners]] was particularly prominent there. Alethela was considered to be dedicated to the arts of war so that no other kingdom had to do so. They consider it their duty to protect all the other nations. People went to Alethela if they could fight or wanted to be trained. Those who had fought the [[Ten Deaths\|Ten Deaths]] could go to Alethela and be trained so that the changes wrought in them by fighting the Ten Deaths would not destroy them.
[[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]] was the written language they used. By the time of the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], the Radiants spoke a language known as Alethelan.
