## Allomantic Use
A zinc [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Rioter**. Emotional Allomancy is not mind control, but it does allow the practitioner to influence the emotions of those around them. This is known as **Rioting** or **Raging**. The effects can be targeted at a specific individual or group and can focus on specific emotions. Rioting emotions can be used to increase someone's desire, determination, or anger. It can accomplish many of the same things as [[Brass\|Soothing]] emotions by Rioting all but the specified emotions. Extreme emotions in the target will interfere with emotional [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]. Emotional Allomancy can affect animals, however it requires a certain amount of sapience. Emotional Allomancy also has a more compelling effect on [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] compared to a regular person.
Very powerful Rioting can put a Hemalurgic creature under complete control of the Rioter, and once controlled, the Rioting is no longer required. This can either be achieved by a solitary [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] or [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgist]] burning [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] and zinc together, a combination of a [[Nicrosil\|Nicroburst]] and a Rioter, or a group of Rioters and/or Soothers, though in the early days of [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], when Allomancy was much more powerful, a single Rioter was able to do it.
Rioting inside of a [[Bendalloy\|speed bubble]] could give the same effects as burning duralumin, and can still be aimed without the normal hindrances of exiting time bubbles. Aluminum over the victim's head or possibly the Rioter's chest stops Rioting.
After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], it is unlawful for a business to use Rioters to influence customers. This was one of the provisions of the [[Allomantic Agreement of '94\|Allomantic Agreement of '94]]. However, consensual use of emotional Allomancy is not forbidden, and some rioters, known as **zinc counselors** uses their abilities as a kind of therapy.

## Feruchemical Use
A zinc [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Sparker**. Zinc is used to store mental speed. It allows the Sparker to think very quickly and come to conclusions faster. While filling a zincmind, the Sparker will be dull-witted and slow. Storing does not affect the Sparker's ability to take in physical information, but it does increase the time it takes to process that information. For example, a Sparker filling their zincmind will perceive words without delay, but will take longer to parse their meaning. Tapping zinc has the odd side effect of making the user hungry.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, zinc steals emotional fortitude.

### Kandra Blessing
The [[Kandra\|kandra]] can use a pair of these spikes as a [[Blessing\|Blessing]] and call them the **Blessing of Stability**. Like all kandra Blessings, the Blessing gives the [[Mistwraith\|mistwraiths]] sentience, with the added benefit of emotional stability.

## Fabrial Use
A [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] with a zinc cage will increase the strength of the fabrial's function.

## Culture
Zinctongue is a colloquialism for smooth talkers.

## Trivia
In the [[Ars Arcanum\|Ars Arcanum]] of [[The Final Empire\|The Final Empire]], the allomantic roles of [[Brass\|brass]] and zinc were swapped. This was fixed in [[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]], then repeated in [[The Hero of Ages\|The Hero of Ages]].
