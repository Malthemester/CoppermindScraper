**Melishi** is a historical [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]] of the [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Order of Bondsmiths]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Attributes and Abilities
For more information, see Order of Bondsmiths#Abilities.
Melishi was bonded to the [[Sibling\|Sibling]], which allowed him to use the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Tension\|Tension]] and [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]]. The Sibling was exceptionally selective regarding their bonded human, and mentions taking years to find a human that fit them exactly.
Melishi can presumably utilize the Surges similarly to others of his Order. For example, the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] says that Melishi was able to see the [[Connection\|Connections]] between people as Dalinar does. He also seems to be an expert regarding [[Fabrial\|fabrials]], based on the nature of Urithiru and the protections he put in place for the Sibling.

## History
>‚Äú*[Melishi] could make no specific account of his process; it was related to the very nature of the Heralds and their divine duties, an attribute the Bondsmiths alone could address.*‚Äù
\-Words of Radiance, chapter 30, page 18[2]


Melishi is thought to have lived several thousand years ago, and was likely the only Bondsmith of his generation. Like the other Radiants, he fought against the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] during the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]]; the book *Words of Radiance* stated that he was determined to destroy them using abilities unique to the Bondsmith order. His plan was related to the nature of the [[Herald\|Heralds]] and he was not able to fully explain it to the other orders of Radiants.
The [[Urithiru gem archive\|Urithiru gem archive]] held some additional details about Melishi's plan. Melishi and other scholar Radiants of the time believed that the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] had [[Connection\|Connected]] to the [[Parsh\|parsh]] and was supplying them with [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]], facilitating their Forms of Power. The Radiants intended to capture Ba-Ado-Mishram using Melishi's abilities and a [[Perfect gemstone\|perfect gemstone]], denying them Voidlight and thus bringing the war to an end. However, [[Naze-daughter-Kuzodo\|Naze-daughter-Kuzodo]] was concerned about the unintended side effects of Melishi's actions. The specific outcome of Melishi's plan is not known, but the events surrounding this conflict are believed to be the basis of the legendary [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]]. [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]] comments to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] that when the parsh were "conquered", their Connection and [[Identity\|Identity]] were damaged, creating what was known as "[[Slaveform\|slaveform]]" for several millennia.

>‚Äú*I hate humans. Humans twist what is said and always make themselves out to be right. How long until you demand that I bond a human, give up my freedom, and risk my life? I'm sure you‚Äôll have wonderful explanations as to why I should absolutely do that.*‚Äù
\-The Sibling, to Navani[14]


Melishi is also the creator of the barrier surrounding the [[Sibling\|Sibling's]] pillar at the heart of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], which is powered by four gemstone nodes throughout the tower. The Stormfather refers to the Sibling being hurt by humanity in the past and the Sibling expresses significant bitterness towards Melishi, blaming him for their loss of freedom and risking their life. The Sibling also had an aversion to fabrials since they involved imprisoning spren. However, at least some of Melishi's actions proved necessary to protect the Sibling and Urithiru from invasion. The Sibling somehow knew to end their bond with Melishi voluntarily before the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] so they would not become a [[Deadeye\|deadeye]], and they swore to never bond another human, only reluctantly bonding [[Navani\|Navani]] out of necessity.
