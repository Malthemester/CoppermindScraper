A **master-servant** is a [[Vorin\|Vorin]] profession that can be held by [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] citizens of the second [[Nahn\|nahn]]. They are hired to work for well-off [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] and to attend to their needs. They perform a number of duties including, but not limited to, fetching refreshments and meals, delivering messages, and staffing events and institutions. A variety of hand signals can be used to indicate to the master-servant what task is required, or simply to request assistance.
The standard uniform for a master-servant includes a crisp white shirt with an emblem over the breast and either black pants or a black skirt. Those with long hair will often wear it bound. Master-servants in training have an all black uniform and there is no emblem on their shirts. The refined manner in which they act is a point of pride for most master-servants, though this attitude is mocked by those of other classes.
Master-servants staff the [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranthian]] [[Conclave\|Conclave]] and the [[Palanaeum\|Palanaeum]].
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] posed as a master servant when he broke into the Conclave in Kharbranth to kill [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]].
