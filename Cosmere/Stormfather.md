\-The Stormfather explaining his role to Dalinar.[8]

The **Stormfather** is a powerful and unique [[Spren\|spren]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] responsible for the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. He is one of the three [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren, and is currently bonded to [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. To the [[Listener\|listeners]], he is known as the **Rider of Storms**.

## Appearance and Personality

>“*I have burned and broken cities myself. I can see … yes, I see a difference now. I see pain now. I did not see it before the bond.*”
\-The Stormfather.[11]


For more images, see [[Stormfather/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
The vast majority of the time, the Stormfather is simply a disembodied presence in the skies, or an overpowering voice within the highstorm itself. On the occasions that he does show himself, he takes the form of an enormous, imperious face made out of the clouds, that seems to stretch from horizon to horizon into infinity.

>“*Of course, if the Stormfather was listening, he'd correct Dalinar’s mistakes. The Stormfather hated to be misquoted.*”
\-Dalinar on the Stormfather[7]

He is extremely prideful and haughty, convinced of his own power and righteousness. He does not care for humanity, only serving them and sending [[Visions\|visions]] because he was bid to do so by Honor. He is particularly focused on oaths and keeping them, and does not take kindly to those who would break them. His sense of justice does not mean he demands that men follow what is *right*, however; to him, a genocide is not an evil deed if it was done as punishment for breaking an oath.
He's often incapable of understanding human emotions and thoughts, and finds their unstable nature untrustworthy. Over time, when bonded to a human, he begins to gain a sense of empathy and understanding of people. He also begins to gain a sense of morality, understanding the harm his actions have brought to people. This does not mean he grows much more kind or gentle, though, as he still believed that the storms are his domain and his alone, and is fine with killing those who would dare to challenge him on that, like sailors on the open sea.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Nature
 by  taratjah 
>“* I am a sliver of the Almighty himself! *”
\-The Stormfather.[9]

The Stormfather is a [[Spren\|spren]], making him naturally immortal and intangible. Unlike most other spren, he is mostly present in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] rather than [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], and thus cannot see inside of it, even though his highstorms affect it. He is one of the most powerful spren on Roshar, with an immense amount of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], greater even than that of the [[Unmade\|Unmade]], although he is much more restricted than them in what he can do with it.
He has merged with [[Tanavast\|Tanavast's]] [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]], making him something akin to a [[Sliver\|Sliver]] along with being a [[Splinter\|Splinter]]. He considers himself to be a memory men created for the Almighty, now that the god himself is gone. It is unclear how much of Tanavast is left within him, as though he seems to share some of his memories and opinions, particularly in regards to [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], his standoffish nature does not match what has been seen of Tanavast.
The Stormfather's unusual nature as both a spren and a Cognitive Shadow gives some additional abilities to the [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] bonded to him in the present times. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] is able to use it to merge the [[Physical Realm\|Physical]], [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] and [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realms]], creating [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]]. This allows people to travel between [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] and Roshar, and releases near-infinite amounts of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] into the surrounding area, albeit the perpendicularity doesn't last for long. [[Odium\|Odium]] refers to the whole event as Ascending. Whether this can be used in another Realm beyond the Physical is unknown.

### Highstorms
The Stormfather commands the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]], the powerful hurricanes that scour Roshar at regular intervals. While he ordinarily sticks to his schedule, he can summon them to a particular location if need be. The highstorms also grant him the ability to summon [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], although he cannot do so outside of a highstorm.
While he rides the storms, and can perceive everything within them, his consciousness is not restricted to them -- he is capable of speaking to [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] from great distances, and unlike other Radiant spren, he does not need to remain close to him. This being said, he does not have absolute control over everything that happens within his storms, and he's incapable of stopping singers from using it to bond with spren, even [[Voidspren\|voidspren]].
Within a highstorm, the Stormfather is capable of communicating with people, appearing as an enormous face and speaking in a thunderous voice. Doing so slows down time greatly.

### Visions
For more information, see [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]].
The Stormfather is capable of sending people visions, so long as his target is in an area experiencing a highstorm. Whether or not a person is currently awake or asleep is irrelevant, and it appears that the vision cannot be resisted. The visions can be given to more than one person at a time, as long as all other than his bonded Surgebinder are within a highstorm. His bonded Surgebinder is also able to enter a vision without a highstorm and is able to bring in others with them outside of a highstorm as long as they are touching the Bondsmith. When speaking to others inside of a vision, accents might not carry over.
The visions the Stormfather sends out have been bestowed upon him by [[Honor\|Honor]] near the end of the Shard's life, to be given to those who would be best served by them, such as possible future Bondsmiths. They play out as a pre-recorded, heavily interactive scenes, set in another place and another time. The target of the vision assumes the role of someone who lived in that time and place, and the people conjured up by the vision interact with them as though they were that person.
The target cannot summon their [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], although they are capable of using their Surgebinding abilities. They can, however, feel pain and attempt to act out their actions within a vision, which sometimes requires that their physical bodies be restrained. They will speak the language matching the time period and location of the vision, even if they aren't normally able to speak it.
While the Stormfather ordinarily has a cycle of visions he goes through on a loop, he can send his bonded Bondsmith to them even outside of a highstorm, and transport the Bondsmith into any area of the vision "map". He has almost complete control over the visions, being able to insert people as various characters within them and manipulate the passing of time, but entities such as [[Shard\|Shards]] or [[Lift\|Lift]] can override him.
Certain places are immune to the Stormfather's visions, preventing him from accessing them. This included [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] while it was inhabited by [[Unmade\|Unmade]], and Urithiru while the Sibling was partially corrupted, negating Radiant abilities.

### Dreams
Outside of the visions, the Stormfather is capable of communicating through dreams. Those dreams usually take place in a blank space that seems outside of time and space. People experiencing them feel as though everything around them fades away, replaced by solid ground and wind that seems to stop in place. Unlike the visions, the dreams seem to take up no time at all in the real world.

 by  botanicaxu  The Stormfather and the [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] [[Spren\|spren]]
### Nahel Bond
>“* I will not be a simple sword to you. I will not come as you call, and you will have to divest yourself of that... monstrosity that you carry. You will be a Radiant with no Shards. *”
\-The Stormfather upon bonding Dalinar.[9]

The Stormfather is one of the three great [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren. Forming a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with him grants one the power over the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Tension\|Tension]] and [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]]. He is currently bonded with [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]].
While a Bondsmith can use Adhesion the way a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] would, they can also apply their powers in different manner, using them more in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]]. Using Spiritual Adhesion, a Bondsmith can form a connection between themselves and another person, allowing them to speak their language. They also seem capable of hearing the spiritual aspects of objects, and use this to mend broken things back whole. Bondsmiths can also summon Stormlight at will, although this requires significant effort. Due to his connection with highstorms, his Bondsmith will feel more energetic on highstorm days.
There are several differences between the Stormfather and other Radiant spren. Unlike them, he is capable of maintaining consciousness in the Physical Realm even without the Bond, although it grants him deeper understanding of humanity and its foibles, along with the ability to empathize with others and more human responses, like cursing. He also does not become a Shardblade, either due to his immense power or due to his immense dislike for humanity. In addition, he can hear statements or questions directed to him, and speak directly into his Surgebinder's mind, even if he does not seem to be nearby. His Bondsmith can also communicate with him by thinking.

### Honorspren
The Stormfather is the creator of the modern [[Honorspren\|honorspren]], a duty that was bestowed upon him by [[Honor\|Honor]] shortly before the latter's death. Following the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], where almost all of them have been killed, he stopped doing so; however, he would eventually create ten of them, which would eventually create others, leading to the resurgence of the race.
Today, many honorspren treat him as an honored ancestor and obey his wishes, with [[Syl\|Syl]] in particular referring to him as her father. The Stormfather, in turn, considers them his children. He apparently exerts some influence over their ability to form [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]], although he cannot stop them if their Surgebinder says the proper Oaths. He is also able to grant them more human-like emotions, but refuses to do so.

## History
### Origins and the Recreance
>“* During these days, Honor still lived. I was not yet fully myself. More of a storm. Less interested in men. *”
\-About his origins[13]

The Stormfather is likely to be one of the oldest entities in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], as the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] he commands predate even the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]]. During the early millennia of his existence, he was not particularly cognizant or self-aware, but rather simply the uncaring storm. Even back then, however, he was capable of bonding with humans.
Shortly before the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], [[Honor\|Honor]] altered the Stormfather in a frantic preparation for his own death. Among other changes, he gave him the capacity to create [[Honorspren\|honorspren]], as well as bestowed him with a set of visions to be sent to a person who would benefit from them, in the event of a new [[Desolation\|Desolation]]. Back then, the Stormfather had only childlike intelligence, although it grew over time. When the Recreance came, grieving for the lost honorspren -- which he believed included [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]] -- he refused to make new ones for centuries. Eventually, he created ten, who would then create children of their own, until the honorspren became a nation again.

 by  Marie Seeberger  Bonding with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]
### Visions and Bonds
At some point shortly before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Syl was rediscovered, and the Stormfather arranged to have her delivered to one of the honorspren cities, ordering [[Notum\|Notum]] to keep an eye on her. Against his wishes, she eventually escaped to form a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] after realizing that a new Desolation was coming.
Around the same time, the Stormfather began sending out his visions. While there were less than ten people to have received them, the only ones known are [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. Gavilar began seeing them shortly before his death, although he interpreted them far differently than they were supposed to be. This led indirectly to the creation of the [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]], as well as Gavilar's cooperation with the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]] in a bid to bring the [[Herald\|Heralds]] back, even if it meant starting a new Desolation.
Following Gavilar's death, the Stormfather began sending his visions to the younger brother. This led to Dalinar's reputation in the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] warcamps plummeting, but also to him beginning to research the Desolations and making the first attempt at truly uniting Alethkar. At the same time, as [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was bonding Syl, the Stormfather was keeping an eye on him. When Kaladin was strung up by to face his judgement by [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas']] orders, the Stormfather appeared, as if observing him, although Kaladin later assumed it was a delirious hallucination.
The Stormfather later visited Kaladin directly in a dream, where the two had a conversation. He accused Kaladin of being a traitor, and shared his belief that humans couldn't be trusted. His predictions seemingly came true when Kaladin killed Syl by breaking his bond. Stormfather visited him in a subsequent highstorm to tell him that she was dead and that Kaladin would never [[Surgebind\|Surgebind]] again. While he let [[Shallan\|Shallan]] see him as well, he didn't speak with her.
During the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], the Stormfather spoke to Dalinar out of a vision, claiming that the Alethi were lost, and promising to send a highstorm to sweep away their bodies. At the same time, Syl began to regain her consciousness, and so the Stormfather departed to stop her from re-bonding Kaladin. Despite his best efforts, Syl succeeded, and the Stormfather reluctantly conceded allowing her to restore her bond.
Following the battle, Dalinar climbed to the top of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to speak with him. The Stormfather answered, explaining the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and Honor's death, whereupon Dalinar attempted to bond him. Though initially, the Stormfather was hostile to the idea, he eventually agreed once Dalinar said the [[Immortal Words\|Immortal Words]], although under the stipulation that Dalinar would wield no [[Shardblade\|Shards]].

### Bondsmith spren
 by  Connor Chamberlain  The Stormfather presiding over Dalinar and Navani's marriage
>“* Oaths are the soul of righteousness. If you are to survive the coming tempest, oaths must guide you. *”
\-At Dalinar's and Navani's wedding[12]

This new bond allowed the Stormfather to show Dalinar Honor's visions at will, leading to Dalinar exploring them extensively. Shortly afterwards, Dalinar asked the Stormfather to marry him and [[Navani\|Navani]], to which he agreed.
From then on out, the Stormfather served as a source of information for Dalinar. While he refused to give him the reasons for the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], he explained the nature of the [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]], as well as the reason why [[Honor\|Honor]] thought the plan of fighting [[Odium\|Odium]] in a contest of champions would work -- that Odium is a force of nature, and as such, bound by rules. Eventually, after a conversation concerning whether [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)\|Oathbringer]] can be brought back to life, the Stormfather revealed that he can send visions to other people, allowing Dalinar to instantaneously communicate across vast distances, making negotiations with far away people much easier.
Initially, the plan went reasonably well, with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] conversing with [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen Rnamdi]] of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] and convincing her to consider his offer. Afterwards, the Stormfather brought him, [[Navani\|Navani]] and [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] to the vision of [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]] to explore it. It was there that he told Dalinar about the origins and fate of the [[Herald\|Heralds]], though he again refused to speak about the Recreance. Shortly afterwards, during a trip back to the warcamps, he told Dalinar that he was beginning to feel empathy for people dying in his storms.

### The Downward Spiral
>“*This is the lot I have chosen. It is you or oblivion.*”
\-The Stormfather to Dalinar.[16]


The free exploration of the visions ended when [[Odium\|Odium]] invaded one of the visions, with the Stormfather powerless to stop him. Though the great spren quickly recovered his poise, there was no doubt that he was terrified of the Shard, and for the time being, further visions were suspended. Eventually, Dalinar began inquiring about the current fate of the Heralds, and the Stormfather informed him that he could see [[Ishar\|Ishar]], and that the old Binder of Gods cursed his name at night.
Soon afterwards, Dalinar's memories of the burning of [[Rathalas\|Rathalas]] returned. Afterwards, he confronted the Stormfather about his reasons for bonding a monster such as himself, to which the Stormfather answered that to him, what Dalinar had done was administering justice -- but also that now, with his bond more advanced, he understood the immorality of the act.
When Dalinar traveled to [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], he felt the return of the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], and sought to run away. Despite the Stormfather's protests, he managed to summon something gleaming and white and used it to open the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], causing the great spren significant pain. Afterwards, Dalinar apologized to him, but the Stormfather was unbothered by the event, or at least acted as though he was.

 by  Connor Chamberlain  Accompanying Dalinar at Thaylen Field
### Eila Stele and Thaylen Field
>“*I was bonded to men before. This never happened then.*”
\-The Stormfather about Honor's Perpendicularity.[20]


The revelations of [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] came soon afterwards. In the aftermath, the Stormfather explained to Dalinar the Recreance and the role Honor played in preventing it in the ages past, as well as Honor's decay shortly before his death.
At the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the Stormfather accompanied Dalinar to his meeting with Odium, though he couldn't explain what the [[Thunderclast\|thunderclasts]] would want with the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]]. When Odium met with Dalinar, the Stormfather fell quiet, banished by the Shard's presence. He quickly returned after Dalinar managed to reject Odium's influence. After Dalinar opened [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]], the Stormfather returned, shocked and uncertain as to what was happening, though he was aware enough to accept Dalinar's words as the Third Ideal of the Bondsmiths, and to point out [[Taln\|Taln]] and [[Shalash\|Shalash's]] presence to his Bondsmith.
In the aftermath of the battle, the Stormfather briefly visited [[Lopen\|Lopen]] to hear out his [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] second ideal, chastising him for thinking he had been ready earlier. Afterwards, he allowed Dalinar and [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to use his presence over [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] to see what had happened to the city.

## Relationships
 by  Artur Felipe Mósca  Presiding over [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Navani\|Navani's]] marriage
### Dalinar
>“*Why did you bond me? Shouldn't you have picked a man who was just?*”
\-Dalinar to the Stormfather.[11]


[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] is the Stormfather's current [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]]; not the first one, but the first in many hundreds of years. Though the Stormfather isn't eager to bond at first, once Dalinar says the Words, the Stormfather commits to staying with Dalinar. He is still abrasive towards him, withholding information he doesn't wish to share, but he strives to help Dalinar, even in the face of [[Odium\|Odium]]. He often acts as Dalinar's confidant in matters the latter is uncomfortable sharing with [[Navani\|Navani]].
In return, the Stormfather gains increased empathy and understanding of human nature. He also picks up less wholesome habits, such as cursing.

### Honor
>“*Of course Honor's suggestion would work. He spoke it.*”
\-The Stormfather.[41]


While he has no choice in obeying [[Honor\|Honor's]] wishes, the Stormfather greatly respects him in many ways. He trusts him implicitly, and has many good things to say about him. He seems to treat him as something of a father figure, likely due to Honor's transformation of him shortly before [[Tanavast\|Tanavast's]] death. The Stormfather is also Honor's [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] to an extent. What this means is uncertain, as while the Stormfather seems to think the same way about [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] Honor used to, he also seems to consider himself a separate entity.

### Sylphrena
>“* You have taken her from me. My beloved one. *”
\-The Stormfather to Kaladin.[61]

[[Syl\|Syl]] is one of the original [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] created by the Stormfather prior to the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Perhaps because of this, he seems to adore her above all his other children, and takes care that she's not harmed. While she calls him her father, she's also clearly frustrated with how overprotective he can be, and will argue with him over what she is and isn't allowed to do.

 by  Katie Payne  Kaladin seeing the Stormfather for the first time
### Kaladin
>“*Just listen to the piece of nature incarnate, okay?*”
\-Syl to Kaladin about her father.[6]


The Stormfather has mixed feelings regarding [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. On one hand, he's furious with him for bonding Syl, and blames him for everything bad that happens to her, immediately assuming that he would kill her. Eventually, he comes to respect him somewhat, although the respect is grudging. Kaladin sometimes rides his storms in dreams, though this seems rather accidental. He's the only person to whom the Stormfather refers to as "child of Tanavast", for a specific, but unknown reason.
Over time, the Stormfather seems to come to care for Kaladin somewhat, in his own way. He helps him travel to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] from [[Revolar\|Revolar]], and later hopes that the Stormblessed can safely return from [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].


## Culture
The [[Vorin\|Vorin]] religion often identifies the Stormfather with the [[Almighty\|Almighty]], as well as one or more of the [[Herald\|Heralds]]. In [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], it's commonly believed that [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] and the Stormfather are the same entity. In [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]], the same is said about [[Kalak\|Kalak]]. A common punishment for some criminals in Vorin countries is being strung up in a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], to be "judged by the Stormfather", which typically equals a death sentence.
The word "stormfather" is a common curse, similar to other variations of the word "storm".
The [[Listener\|listeners]] believe him to be a traitor to their kind, who protected humans instead of them. They still respect him, though, believing that he would kill anyone who doesn't, leading to a mix of awe and fear in their society.

## Trivia
The Stormfather has two different "modes" of speech. He uses small caps when talking to those unbonded to him, or when speaking so that everyone can hear him. He speaks normally when communicating directly with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] after the latter becomes a Bondsmith. Interestingly, there are only four other characters shown speaking in all-caps — [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], [[Odium\|Odium]] when he tells Dalinar we killed you as well as when he speaks to [[Vyre\|Vyre]], [[Syl\|Syl]] when about to be resurrected by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], and Dalinar when connecting Kaladin to Tien.
