>“* Oh, they had leaders, Master Kelsier. Dead ones, true, but leaders nonetheless.*”
\- Sazed[1]


The **Valla** were a religious sect from [[Classical Scadrial\|Classical Scadrial]].

## History
It is one of many historical religions that [[Sazed\|Sazed]] discusses with [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]]. The Vallan religion is notable for being the longest to survive after the rise of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] and the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] persecution of religions other than his own, enduring even after all of its leaders were slaughtered. After a meeting with his crew, Kelsier asks Sazed about the Valla, claiming that he wants a reminder of their perseverance. However, his actual motive was to confirm that martyrs can galvanize people's resolve, foreshadowing his own death and the rise of the [[Church of the Survivor\|Church of the Survivor]].
