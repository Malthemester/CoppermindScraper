The **Faithful** are those who believe that good [[Epic\|Epics]] exist, ones who will use their power for protection rather than domination. The term comes into use after [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]] and the Epics arrive and begin terrorizing humanity. The Faithful think that there will eventually be "superheroes" who will stop the evil Epics.
[[Blain Charleston\|Blain Charleston]] (David's father) and [[Abraham\|Abraham]] are known to be among the Faithful.
David initially thinks people with such faith are foolish: his early life at [[Havendark Factory\|Havendark Factory]] teaches him to be a realist, but to be one of the Faithful requires a certain idealism. However, he eventually comes to believe that [[Prof\|Prof]] is a hero despite being an Epic, though this belief does not transfer to a broader hope for Epics in general.
In the alternate universe, the Faithful include Epics who use their powers for good against evil. These Epics include Blain Charleston, [[Firefight\|Firefight]] and [[Tavi\|Tavi]].
The symbol of the Faithful is described as a "stylized S shape"; Abraham always carries a pendant in that shape. When David travels to [[Babilar\|Babilar]], Abraham also gives him a pendant as a gift, and David often thinks about it afterward. Although it could not explicitly be described as such in the books for legal reasons, the symbol is meant to be the real-world  logo.
