\-Blackcaps to Skar[1]


The **Blackcaps** are the personal guard of Highprince [[Aladar\|Aladar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
The Blackcaps wear a black uniform and helm when they are on duty. They are an elite force, and while they allow darkeyes to join, they are still very selective with their membership.
[[Skar\|Skar]] tried to join the Blackcaps when he came to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Due to Skar's stature, the Blackcaps turned him down, although they claimed they would reconsider if Skar managed to find himself some weapons and armor. Skar stole the required equipment from the Blackcap quartermaster, believing that they would see his theft as a sign of his enthusiasm and cleverness. However, the Blackcaps instead branded Skar a slave and he was later sold to Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] and made a bridgeman. It is likely that the Blackcaps accompanied Highprince Aladar on [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] expedition to [[Narak\|center of the Shattered Plains]] and participated in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. After the start of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the Blackcaps took turns with other groups of soldiers going on plateau runs to collect [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] from [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]].
