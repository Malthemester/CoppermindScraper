**Earth**, sometimes called the **Old Earth**, is the home planet of humans in the [[Cytoverse\|Cytoverse]].
During the early days of humanity's contact with aliens, Earth was ruled by a single institution called the [[United Governments\|United Governments]], aided by the [[United Intelligence Bureau\|United Intelligence Bureau]]. The [[Phone Company\|Phone Company]], the telecom that served as the liaisons between humanity and aliens, was also headquartered there. Over time, however, the planet grew largely irrelevant. Even its location seems to have been forgotten, with some people incorrectly speculating that [[Detritus\|Detritus]] might be Earth's ruins. Nonetheless, both astrophysical data and numerous historical records of Old Earth remain within humanity's and [[Superiority\|Superiority's]] data banks.
By the time the Superiority became a major power, Earth appears to have vanished. Whether it simply means it can't be found on any star charts, or if it's somehow no longer where it should be, is unclear.
