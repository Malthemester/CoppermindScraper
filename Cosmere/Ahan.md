Count **Ahan** is an [[Arelene\|Arelene]] merchant from [[Sel\|Sel]]. He has a daughter, [[Torena\|Torena]], who is courted by [[Shuden\|Shuden]].

## Appearance and Personality
Ahan is very fat and has an air of arrogance about him, not seeming to take much seriously. He is impetuous to a fault, often speaking and acting without thinking. It seems that Ahan never quite understands the gravity of his situation until his actions lead to [[Roial\|Roial's]] death. After this, Ahan falls into a deep depression born from self-loathing.

## History
Following the [[Reod\|Reod]], Ahan rose to prominence in [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] income-based meritocracy, gaining the title of count. Where his fortune fell within the Arelon system is unknown, but was no higher than fourth. He shared a friendly rivalry with Duke [[Roial\|Roial]] and was constantly trying to either outdo or oppose him. In fact, Ahan joined [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] group thinking he was opposing Roial and was shocked to see that Roial was also a member. After Raoden was taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]], Ahan, along with Roial, [[Eondel\|Eondel]] and [[Shuden\|Shuden]], was part of [[Sarene\|Sarene's]] opposition to [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] rule and resistance to [[Hrathen\|Hrathen's]] efforts to convert Arelon.
Shortly after [[Telrii\|Telrii]] seized control of Arelon in the wake of Iadon's death, Ahan betrayed the group of resisters in an effort to finally best his long-time rival. Ahan initially gloated at his former allies, revealing that he had tried to sell them out to Iadon several times before, but then things took a turn for the unexpected when Telrii had Roial executed for treason. Ahan screamed in horror, as Telrii had promised to only imprison the conspirators, but Telrii only laughed when Ahan protested, ordering his guards to kill the others. The group was saved by Raoden, but even he could not save Roial. Roial's death left Ahan struck with guilt and grief from which he never recovered. He lost much of his weight and thereafter only spoke in a dazed, sickly voice.
