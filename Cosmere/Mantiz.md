## Geography
Mantiz lies in the far north of the Western Dominance, and is of a respectable size for this area.
Only one of the [[Ashmounts\|Ashmounts]], Torinost, lies near Mantiz. This means that there falls a bit less ash than in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], but because nobody organised to clean it up the city was almost drowning in it.
Mantiz has four massive keeps breaking its skyline, one of them being [[Keep Shezler\|Keep Shezler]].

## Architecture
The buildings in Mantiz are rounded, have no corners and are rarely symmetrical. The buildings have an organic feel, look unfinished, and are constructed of stone with hardened mud outside.

## History
During [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] training with [[Gemmel\|Gemmel]] they visited Mantiz, at least long enough for Kelsier to get in touch with the local underground. On a certain night they infiltrated Keep Shezler. In there Kelsier fought with and killed [[Antillius Shezler\|Antillius Shezler]], another Mistborn, and afterwards he freed Shezler's [[Skaa\|skaa]] prisoners and took his notebook containing rumours about an [[Malatium\|eleventh metal]].
