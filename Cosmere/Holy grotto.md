**Holy grottos** are places in the [[Purelake\|Purelake]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].
Holy grottos were significant places in the Purelaker religion that worshiped [[Nu Ralik\|Nu Ralik]]. They were the only places where Purelakers dared to speak of their true faith to Nu Ralik rather than their pretended faith to [[Vun Makak\|Vun Makak]], Nu Ralik's jealous younger brother. It is unknown where these holy grottos are located and what makes them believed to be safe from Vun Makak's observation.
