## Ship Models Used
For more information, see [[Starfighter\|starfighter]].
For a list of ship models, see DDF Ships.
The DDF uses a variety of [[Starfighter\|starfighters]], each built for a specific purpose. While some ships, such as the Poco are traditionally used in dogfights against Krell, other ships like the Val are used for reconnaissance. The most common destructor type used in DDF ships is the 138 Stewart destructor and generally cap out at speeds of Mag-10.

## Flights
For a full list of DDF Flights, see DDF Flights.
A Flight at the Defiant Defense Force usually consists of 8-10 pilots who have graduated from the flight school. At any given time, 1/3 of all starfighters and pilots are down in the deeper caverns in case Alta Base is bombed, so the DDF can rebuild. Each flight has a flightleader, who is responsible for coordinating the flight and relaying messages from Flight Command. Each flight ideally has an even number of pilots, so that each pilot can have a wingmate.
