**House Harms** is a [[Noble\|noble]] house in [[Elendel\|Elendel]], [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Members include [[Jackstom Harms\|Jackstom Harms]], [[Steris\|Steris]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]].
Under Jackstom's care, House Harms had grown into a house with an excellent financial status, enough even to bolster the dire financial straits of one of the city's largest, most influential houses. Despite this, their name was unknown in the highest circles of Elendel society, a fact that caused much consternation for the house lord and his daughter Steris. Since there was no male heir, they proposed to remedy this situation by an alliance through marriage with [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], lord of [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]], which was in financial trouble after years of supposed mismanagement by the former lord [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]]. The partnership of the two houses became official with the wedding of Waxillium and Steris in 342. 
In addition to their substantial wealth, the family also had lands in the [[Outer Estates\|Outer Estates]] and owned a mansion in Elendel which served as the primary residence for Steris and Lord Harms. Despite their lower status among the nobility both Steris and Jackstom had a least high enough standing to be invited events such as the [[Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner\|Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner]]. The family had ancestral ties to the [[Spook\|Lord Mistborn]], and as a result [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] ran strong in the family line. This fact made Steris and Marasi targets for the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]].
