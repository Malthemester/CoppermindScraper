Lady **Seaden** is a noble in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. She is Count [[Ahan\|Ahan's]] wife and the mother of [[Torena\|Torena]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is quite overweight, but becomes noticeably thinner after participating in the fencing sessions that [[Sarene\|Sarene]] organized for the noble ladies of the court. She is strong-willed and does not defer to her husband. Her name is based on Aon Sea, which means chastity and faithfulness.

## History
During a needlepoint session with other noble ladies, she commented that priests were the only people that cared which of the religions one worships.
She was quite eager to learn about fencing after hearing tales about the customs in [[Teod\|Teod]], although some of the tales were exaggerated. She and her daughter Torena both participated in Sarene's lessons.
The fencing lessons inspired Seaden to live a healthier lifestyle, including better eating habits. Ahan preferred a full-figured woman and was disappointed by her weight loss, but Seaden was undeterred and tried to convince him that he should also eat better.
There is no indication that Seaden was aware of Ahan's plot to betray [[Roial\|Roial]]; she was not present when Torena and a disgraced Ahan attended [[Hrathen\|Hrathen's]] funeral.
