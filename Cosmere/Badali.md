**Badali** is a [[Order of Stonewards\|Stoneward]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is an affable older man with a powdery beard.
When [[Navani\|Navani's]] scholars found a room in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with no doors but a large exterior window, Badali used his powers to create an entrance and then guarded the location at least until Navani arrived.
