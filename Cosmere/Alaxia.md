**Alaxia** is the stern-looking wife of [[Natir\|Natir]] on Roshar.
Natir is the steward of Citylord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] in [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. Roshone comes from [[Dalilak\|Dalilak]], so Alaxia probably does as well.
Alaxia is the one who reads names off of Roshone's list of people who will be conscripted into [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army, including [[Tien\|Tien]].
