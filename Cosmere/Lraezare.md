## Geography
The city is located on the delta of the [[Ry'Do Ali River\|Ry'Do Ali River]], where it enters the [[Border Ocean\|Southern Border Ocean]]. It is about a three-day round trip from [[Kezare\|Kezare]]. It appears to have a relatively arid climate, and it has steep hills near the water's edge.

## Economy
It is one of the largest ports south of Kezare. The Shipowners' Circle, the ruling council of the [[Helm\|Helm]], is located in Lraezare. It is also the residence of [[Lord Admiral\|Lord Admiral]] [[Lokkall\|Lokkall]].

## History
When [[Kenton\|Kenton]] was trying to gain support for the [[Taisha\|Taisha]] vote regarding the [[Diem\|Diem]], [[Vey\|Vey]] disappeared, hoping to avoid him. [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]] was able to learn that he was in Lraezare. [[Naimeer\|Naimeer]], the dockmaster in Kezare and Vey's nephew, tried to prevent Kenton from sailing out of Kezare, but then-Lord Admiral [[Delius\|Delius]] intervened on Kenton's behalf and joined his party for the journey.
In Lraezare, Kenton was able to confront Vey with the knowledge of his debt to the Diem, securing his vote. Delius was also able to manipulate the Helm into replacing him as Lord Admiral, restoring his ability to own property, including a large fleet of ships. His regained mercantile power allowed him to threaten Lokkall into giving the Diem his vote. Delius, Kenton, and their team then quickly departed for Kezare.
