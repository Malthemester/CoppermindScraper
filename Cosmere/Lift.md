\-Lift to Wyndle[1]


Lift is thirteen years old when the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] begins. She has long, straight black hair that she wears down to her waist. Her skin is tan and she has the rounded features of the [[Reshi\|Reshi]]. Her eyes were originally brown, but by the time Dalinar meets her in Azimir, her eyes are a pale, clear color, likely the result of her being an Edgedancer. Lift always keeps a [[Spheres\|diamond mark]] in her pocket, which she considers lucky.
As would be expected from someone of Lift's age, she often acts child-like. For instance, during her tween years, she claims to be ten because she believes that any number to which she cannot count on her fingers is unlucky. Lift is often sarcastic and irreverent, which annoys her fellow Azish thieves. She also enjoys mocking her [[Spren\|spren]], Wyndle, calling him a [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] instead of a spren because she knows it annoys him and not due to any sort of dislike she has for him. Lift also has little patience for Wyndle's extremely technical explanation of the [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]] behind her abilities. Despite her teasing, she truly does like Wyndle and is genuinely worried for him when she thinks that [[Nale\|Darkness]] is following her to try and kill Wyndle.
Lift has an interesting perspective on the morality of her thievery. She does not think it wrong because it does not hurt anyone. Lift is also totally uninterested in stealing typical items such as gold, jewelry, spheres or anything traditionally of value. Instead, she likes to break into places and eat their food. She steals food for the challenge, rather than trying to gain any sort of wealth for herself. She uses the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Abrasion often in her thefts. She also has a rule not to steal from people who don't have much.
For all her flaws, Lift has a good heart. She has seen much death in her life, but it still impacts her greatly when someone she knows dies. For instance, when [[Gawx\|Gawx]] was mortally wounded, she cared enough to return to try to save him, despite the fact that she was risking capture and death to do so. Lift cares for other people because she believes that someone has to, which seems to be a temperament that is shared by other Edgedancers. Once, Lift tried to stop caring about others, possibly during her time in [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]], but she quit because it was worse than being dead.

## Attributes and Abilities
 by  Randy Vargas  Sliding along the ground with [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]]
### Thievery
Even without any sort of magical help, Lift is a skilled thief. She can scale walls easily and is a skilled enough pickpocket that she can easily steal as many spheres as she likes without it being any sort of challenge. Her mastery of thievery is possibly what drives her to break into heavily guarded locations and steal something so unconventional as food.

### Surgebinding
Lift has formed a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with Wyndle, which grants her the ability to Surgebind, although Lift herself is not entirely certain whether she believes this. As with all Surgebinders, Lift gains superhuman strength and speed when she holds [[Lifelight\|Lifelight]], as well as the ability to heal quickly from non-mortal wounds. When Lift is invested with Lifelight, she refers to it as her "Awesomeness." She is a member of the order of Radiants known as the Edgedancers. This gives her access to two Surges, Abrasion and Progression. Lift also has a rare and possibly unique ability to convert food to Lifelight through consumption. While this may seem a great blessing, she lacks the ability to gather Stormlight from gemstones and other sources, though it is unknown if this is also true for spheres containing [[Lifelight\|Lifelight]].


Abrasion allows her to change the friction of her body against her surroundings. She refers to this ability as her "Slickness." Lift uses this ability often to make quick getaways. She reduces friction on all parts of her body except the soles of her feet and palms of her hands, and then kneels and propels herself swiftly forward using her palms. This also comes in handy when Lift is escaping pursuers, because it is nearly impossible for them to get a grip on her. She can also use it to increase the friction of herself, making it extremely easy to climb walls with even the slightest handholds.


The Surge of Progression allows for two different sorts of abilities. The more basic of these two is simply called Growth. Lift can use Lifelight to increase the rate of growth of plants. When Lift uses Growth, plant life that she illuminates grows at an extremely accelerated rate, and she has some measure of control over the way that it grows. She is less practiced at this ability, but she uses it for things such as making vines grow to force a locked window open. It is unknown if this allows Lift to enhance the Growth rate of animals or not.
The Surge of Progression grants Lift another power as well, known as Regrowth. It allows Lift to heal others from serious injuries that would otherwise be fatal. When Lift uses Regrowth, she breathes out clouds of Lifelight which then flow into the injured person's mouth, healing them.


This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

As a Knight Radiant who has access to two Surges, Lift also has a [[Resonance\|resonance]]. Edgedancers, such as Lift, are suspected of having a resonance that allows them to communicate especially well, though whether this is true is unclear.

### Old Magic

\-The Stormfather about Lift's abilities[12]


Lift's visit to the Nightwatcher leaves her with a rather unique trait, one that is not among the typical power set of the Edgedancers. She exists partially in the Cognitive realm, which grants her some special abilities. The first is that she can touch spren, something that is supposed to be impossible, as they exist mostly in the Cognitive realm. This ability greatly helps Lift with her thievery, as Wyndle takes the form of a vine. He can make handholds or increase the width of ledges for Lift by growing where she needs to go, but no one else is able to see or touch him. She is also one of the few people who can always see [[Syl\|Syl]], regardless on whether she wants to be seen.
Lift's other power is even more impressive. Unlike most Surgebinders, who are able to draw Stormlight from external sources, Lift metabolizes food directly into [[Lifelight\|Lifelight]], and uses Lifelight to fuel her Surges instead of Stormlight.  Food that she can metabolize quicker, such as bread, can be metabolized into Lifelight faster than something like sausage, but may provide less Lifelight overall because it has fewer calories. Her Lifelight is produced in place of sugar. However, this is limited to substances that she can normally digest into nutrients. She can also convert the energy reserves in her own body into Lifelight. With access to the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]], she could theoretically compound [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] to Lifelight as well. These abilities are unique to Lift. However, this power can be dangerous too, as she often risks malnutrition when she burns through all her excess energy. As Lift can only gain Lifelight through metabolizing food, she is limited by the amount of food she has eaten. She may be the only person to have ever had one, or all, of these abilities and it may not have been believed possible until she visited Cultivation. Lift has always assumed that she metabolized Stormlight, not knowing of Lifelight's existence until captured by [[Mraize\|Mraize]].
Lift asked to stay the same and not become someone else, though the actual boon and curse are still unknown, but as an effect of one or the other, her spirit-web has been given the ability to convert mass directly to [[Investiture\|Investiture]].
According to the Stormfather, Lift's boon is unique, as it allows her control over the visions entrusted to him by [[Honor\|Honor]]. She is able to enter the visions without the Stormfather's help, leaving on her own and taking [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] with her. This infuriated the Stormfather, as the Nightwatcher had effectively diminished his authority.

### Aviar
During the battle of Urithitu, Lift saw a fight between two chickens. She healed the red chicken and defended it from the green one. It had a special connection to his [[Gereh\|master]] allowing the [[Aviar\|Aviar]] to lead Lift to him. When the red chicken found its former master dead, it was in great distress. After the freeing of the tower, Lift and Wyndle take care of the chicken.

## History
### Early Life
Despite Lift's race, she was not born in the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]]. The only reason that she knows that she is Reshi is because her mother told her so. She never lived there or knew her people. Lift grew up in the city of Rall Elorim, the City of Shadows, in [[Iri\|Iri]]. Lift had a difficult childhood there. It appears she grew up on the streets there, learning to move through crowds with ease. It is possible that Lift learned her thieving skills in Rall Elorim. She eventually left Rall Elorim for unknown reasons, possibly due to her difficult life. It also seems likely that this was the time in her life when Lift attempted to stop caring.

>‚Äú*When everything else is going wrong, I want to be the same. I want to stay me. Not become someone else.*‚Äù
\-Lift's request of Cultivation[13]

Lift visited the [[Valley\|Valley]] to see the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]] and ask a boon of her, though she saw [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] instead. It is unknown what Lift's boon or curse are, but her request was to not change. Her boon does not appear to have stopped her from aging, but it is possible she is incapable of growing up. Wyndle believes that Cultivation altered her to exist partially in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. Due to this incredible power bestowed upon Lift by their mother, the [[Ring\|Ring]] decided that Wyndle should be sent to bond with her, so he could mold her while she was still young. This granted Lift her Surgebinding abilities.
Lift spent some time in [[Marabethia\|Marabethia]], where she was hunted by Darkness, because he believed that her Surgebinding could bring another [[Desolation\|Desolation]] to Roshar. She fled Marabethia and went to the capital of Azir, Azimir. There, Lift fell in with a crew of thieves. The crew was made up of [[Tigzikk\|Tigzikk]], who Lift called Tig, [[Huqin\|Huqin]], his nephew Gawx, [[Maxin\|Maxin]], and two unnamed brothers who were quick with knives. Tigzikk was the only one Lift knew well. An informant told him which night would be good for robbing the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]], while the vizerate was busy choosing a new [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]], following the death of the last two at the hands of [[Szeth\|Szeth]]. Lift could have robbed the palace on her own, but she felt like she owed it to Tigzikk to help him, and she wanted to make sure that he would be safe.
Sometime between visiting the Nightwatcher and the events of the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] heist, Lift met Hoid.

### Bronze Palace Heist
>‚Äú*What's the point of sneaking into a palace if not to get in trouble?*‚Äù
\-Lift[1]


When the crew entered the grounds of Bronze Palace, Lift spotted Darkness in the streets near the palace and quickly climbed the wall to escape. She used Wyndle to gain access to a room which the thieving crew began ransacking for clothes and shoes. Lift was supposed to keep watch in the room with Gawx, but she left in search of food, and he followed. They disagreed about where to go; she wanted to go to the Prime's quarters where she could find food, but Gawx wanted to go to the Vizers' quarters, which he thought would be mostly empty. They each went their separate ways.
Lift managed to successfully sneak into the Prime's quarters because of the commotion caused when Gawx was caught. However, before she could eat much food, Darkness arrived, along with two associates, bearing forms that gave him the authority to arrest and execute her. Lift was briefly captured and managed to escape, but during the process one of Darkness's men cut Gawx's throat. Despite the fact that she was safely away, Lift decided to return to try to heal Gawx from his wound.

>‚Äú*I will remember those who have been forgotten.*‚Äù
\-The Second Ideal of the Edgedancers[1]


Lift stated the [[Immortal Words\|second ideal]] of the Edgedancers and performed [[Regrowth\|Regrowth]] for the first time to heal him. Consequently Darkness captured her and dragged her away to execute her. However, the viziers thought that Gawx healed himself, and believed that it was a sign from the Heralds that Gawx was to be their new Prime Aqasix. They thought it meant that he could survive future attacks from the [[Szeth\| Assassin in White]]. Gawx hurriedly pardoned Lift for her crimes, and Darkness was forced to release her.

### Yeddaw
 by  Ben McSweeney  Lift arriving in [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]]

After some time in [[Azimir\|Azimir]], Lift left for [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]], uncomfortable with how she was settling in at the palace. While attempting to enter the city she interrupted a local guard, [[Hauka\|Hauka]], while she was reviewing a smuggler who was also trying to enter the city. Lift avoided capture after being discovered in the smuggler's pile of tallew, and then tipped the cart over into the immigrant district of the city. She then jumped off the ledge after it and avoided death by grabbing onto Wyndle to slow her descent.
She then went in search of urchins to find a place where she could eat, since she expended most of her Stormlight evading the guards. She met a girl who told her of the [[Tashi's Light Orphanage\|Tashi's Light Orphanage]], a place where she could potentially get a meal if she got on the good side of the woman who ran it.
When Lift arrived at the orphanage she was told to wait which upset her. While waiting she saw a mother come by the orphanage to drop off her child, as he was hurt and she could no longer care for him. When the [[Stump\|Stump]] came to bring the child in, Lift was told that she would be given only three meals at the orphanage. After getting her first meal, she talked with an old man sitting on one of the stone benches in front of the orphanage. He told her that the woman who ran the orphanage liked to trade spheres, and that if she could find someone who would trade with her then she might let Lift stay at the orphanage.


After she left the orphanage, Lift set out in search of the guard she met at the gate. She found Hauka and followed her to her home, where she saw Darkness go in to question her on her altercation with Lift. She then tailed Darkness to his base of operations within the city. After eating his food, she spied on Darkness and learned that he had two recruits in addition to Szeth. She overheard them talking about searching for her and for another person within the city who was a potential Surgebinder.
After this, Lift returned to the orphanage to claim her second meal from the Stump. While she was there she saw the boy whose mother dropped him off during her first visit. She noticed that his condition seemed to have significantly improved. The Stump blamed this on him faking his injury all along so he could take from the orphanage. She also had another conversation with the old man outside the orphanage.
Lift went off in search of a place where records in the city were stored. She traded for information with a woman who pointed her to the [[Grand Indicium\|Grand Indicium]] at the center of the city. She traveled to the large building to find information about the other Surgebinder in the city. She went straight to the front of the building, and told the scribe at the desk that she was a friend of the emperor of Azir. The scribe did not believe her so Lift used a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] to contact the Aquasix in Azimir who bade the scribes to assist Lift. She ordered the scribes to search the information for any strange events that have happened in the city recently, but none of them seemed pertinent. The scribes abandoned the search due to the incoming [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. Lift realized that Darkness' minions likely got the same idea to track down the Surgebinder as she did, and heads off in search of where in the building they might be.
When she found the room where Darkness' lackeys were looking for the information, Lift had Wyndle follow them inside to listen for who they were targeting. She stayed outside the room which was guarded by Szeth, who was sitting in the hallway outside the door. Wyndle did not gather much information other than the fact that the [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]] had found their target, so Lift followed them when they left the room. She was confronted by Szeth who partially unsheathed [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]]. Outside the building Szeth had a conversation with Lift, he informed her that he did not attack her in the hallway because Nightblood liked her. He told her the other Skybreakers were in search of the old man who often sits outside the orphanage. There were rumors that he could change his appearance and he was marked as a potential [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]]. He told her she had no chance of catching up to them in time, but Lift set out after them anyway.

 by  LittleGreyDragon  Lift hugging [[Nale\|Nale]] in the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]

When Lift reached the orphanage, she heard a scream that made her believe she had come too late. The Stump confronted her outside the orphanage, believing her to be the source of the scream. Lift asked for the last of her three meals to replenish her Lifelight before going off to confront the Skybreakers
Outside Lift found that instead of the old man being the one harmed, it was in fact the two Skybreakers who lay dead on the ground. The man revealed himself to be [[Arclo\|Arclo]], a Dysian [[Aimian\|Aimian]]. He went on several tangents about philosophy before revealing that Darkness would go after the other Surgebinder if she were to flee. Arclo then guided Lift to the conclusion that the Stump was the other Surgebinder, leaving Lift to go back running towards the orphanage.
She arrived at the orphanage to find that Darkness had beaten her there. They fought and he ultimately trapped her with his knife until the Stump came back down from the roof of the orphanage. The Stump struck Darkness with a wood board, which allowed Lift to free herself. Darkness stabbed the Stump and left her to bleed out while he chased Lift. Wyndle encouraged Lift to "Say the Words". Lift said that she'd spoken them in her heart, but wondered how they could help. They ended up on the roof, where Wyndle formed a shard weapon to block Darkness' Shardblade. As Nale taunted her, Lift spoke aloud the [[Immortal Words\|third ideal]] of the Edgedancer. She urged Nale to view the raging Everstorm and parshmen transformed into Stormform Listeners which convinced him that the Voidbringers were back, and that there was no point in killing Surgebinders.

>‚Äú*I will listen to those who have been ignored.*‚Äù
\-The Third Ideal of the Edgedancers[40]


Lift was able to help Stump heal, and explained to her some of the abilities she has, like the ability to heal herself and those around her. Lift then left to head back to Azimir.

### Meeting Dalinar
Lift next appeared during a vision [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] was sharing with [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]]. She advised her friend not to trust [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], as she sensed he had a bloodthirsty past, before helping the emperor leave the vision early. By then, she and Yanagawn had a close bond ‚Äî he always listened to her opinions and took them into account when making his decisions.
She reappeared in the vision where [[Odium\|Odium]] visited Dalinar, though only making herself known after the [[Shard\|Shard]] left. This time, she talked with Dalinar at length and was more willing to listen to him, even agreeing to visit [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] as long as she would be provided with good food. The two met again in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] when Dalinar arrived to negotiate, and she recognized ‚Äî supposedly by his smell ‚Äî that he too had visited the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. As with most people, she stole his food; however, after chatting with him, she decided to share some of it back. She came to Urithiru sometime afterwards along with Yanagawn, and then traveled with him to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] aboard Azish ships.
Following the revelations of [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]], the coalition that Dalinar had built fell apart, and the Azish fleet sailed away at the urging of Yanagawn's other advisors, despite Lift insisting that they remain. Though she was aboard as they left, she knocked out her guard and escaped to rejoin the other Radiants in the city.

 by  Marie Seeberger  Trying to save [[Szeth\|Szeth]] at the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]
### Thaylen Field
During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Lift initially joined Dalinar; however, he tasked her with retrieving [[Honor's Drop\|Honor's Drop]], a perfect gemstone that the [[Fused\|Fused]] had recently stolen from the city's gemstone reserve. Though neither of them understood its importance at the time, Lift agreed, and departed before Dalinar could meet Odium.
She spent most of the battle chasing after it, initially alone with [[Wyndle\|Wyndle]], then accompanied by [[Szeth\|Szeth]] and [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] once they arrived at Thaylen Field. However, when Szeth unsheathed Nightblood, the sword went out of control, attempting to devour his [[Investiture\|Investiture]] and destroy him. Lift attempted to heal him from the damage it was causing; however, when she touched him, she was trapped by Nightblood's tendrils and almost overcome as well until Dalinar's [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]] provided enough power to sate the blade, allowing Szeth to re-sheath it.
With the danger of being devoured past, she and Szeth returned to their hunt for Honor's Drop and, after extensive chase, managed to obtain it. To throw the Fused off their trail, Lift took the Drop to [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and had her create a [[Illumination\|Lightwoven]] copy on a regular rock, then allowed the Fused to steal the fake. At Szeth's urging, Lift was the one to enter the [[Thrill\|Thrill]] and give the Drop to Dalinar. Afterwards, she remained to see him trap Nergaoul.

### Knight Radiant
A year after the battle of Thaylen Field, Lift was one of the Edgedancers on the *Fourth Bridge* during the evacuation mission to [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. When leaving the airship, she missed the jump and tripped over a rock that the other Edgedancers had avoided. A while later, she sneaked into the manor where Kaladin was fighting against [[Lezian\|a Fused]]. She tried to drag the injured [[Godeke\|Godeke]] out of the room. At Kaladin's request she disabled the suppressor fabrial that was preventing the Radiants from using their powers. She told him that she had seen Roshone enter the manor with Godeke but that he hadn't come out yet. Kaladin would search while he ordered Lift to get Godeke out and bring the fabrial to Navani.


Some time later during a meeting of the rulers of the coalition, Navani noticed Lift was present by the state of the snack table. As there are no more honorspren willing to bond a Radiant, the coalition wants to send an envoy to them. When Dalinar suggests sending an Edgedancer, Lift emerged and volunteered. The rulers tried to tactfully decline as they wanted someone more mature, while Lift pointed out that Wyndle was famous on account of his chair collection. Godeke spoke up and was sent instead.
Several weeks later, Lift is stealing food in Urithiru. It was not as much fun as it used to be, as people left food out for her to 'steal'. She moved through air vents along the ceilings and walls. She had the feeling "everything" was wrong, which she always had during the everstorm. Lift looked what was in the basket left by [[Gift\|Gift]]. When Wyndle asked, Lift snapped that she was not supposed to be liked and she was a mysterious shadow. She and Wyndle made some more jokes while she moved through the tower. She noticed how there were more tight squeezes she needed awesomeness for than a year ago. She then reached her nest. After eating, she went to the wall and used Wyndle to measure her height, she had grown an inch since last measurement. She suggested to stop eating to stop growing, but her spren doubted she could. They then talk of Lift's visit to the Nightwatcher, and Cultivation. Lift admitted to asking not to change. Wyndle asked why changing bothered her so much, to which she replied she was her mother's little girl. She was very uncomfortable with the changes in her body. The last time she felt right was when she was with her mother. Wyndle wrapped himself around the girl to comfort her. Suddenly he says something happened and something is very wrong. Lift noticed she couldn't make her body slick anymore. At the perimeter of the tower she could not see anything wrong, until they noticed fallen Windrunners near the Oathgate.


Looking out, Lift noticed a red and a green [[Aviar\|Aviar]] fighting in the sky. She used Wyndle to climb along the tower, to the spren's dismay. The red chicken fled onto a balcony, where the Edgedancer found it on the floor. She tried to summon Wyndle as a blade to ward of the oncoming green chicken, but he couldn't become a weapon. When it hit her in the face, she bit it and it flew away. Her light healed her face and then she healed the chicken but had to push through a resistance. While she healed, Wyndle scouted and noticed Radiants dropping unconscious. The chicken indicated Lift should follow them, and lead her to the corpse of an [[Gereh\|old Alethi man]] with a knife wound to the chest. The chicken went to the body and mourned. Lift deduced the chicken could feel the men and was no ordinary chicken. Wyndle remembered the man as a minor functionary who used to wear rings. This made Lift recall she had seen him when visiting the old people in the tower. Suddenly something moved, and a [[Mraize\|tall man]] appeared with the green chicken on his shoulder. Lift started running while the man started laughing. He managed to catch her and put her in a cage, likely surrounded with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]]. Later, he brought her to [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] as a gift and mentioned she was fueled by [[Lifelight\|Lifelight]] instead of Stormlight.
After a few weeks, Lift was freed by [[Venli\|Venli]], who made her promise not to tell anyone about her willshaping powers. Lift wanted to run, but the Singer persuaded her she was needed to save Kaladin. Venli led her to a room to wait for [[Rlain\|Rlain]] and [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]], who were happy to see her. Dabbid asked if Lift could still heal, and when she confirmed immediately led her away to go to Kaladin. They took different paths to the tenth floor, and Lift made jokes when Rlain and Dabbid arrived. They wanted to hurry, and made it to the hiding place. After she opened the door with Light, they found Kaladin very sick. Lift went and healed him, which was the hardest she had ever done. When Rlain started to question Dabbid on why he never spoke before, the Edgedancer defended him. While the others talked, Lift also healed Teft to the surprise of the others.

 by  clarinking  Lift and her "[[Aviar\|red chicken]]"

Later, Lift visited Kaladin and Teft, and re-healed the latter to prevent him from slipping back into a coma. She had managed earlier to speak with one of the scholars to learn that Navani had been isolated for two weeks. While Kaladin was questioning what they should do, Teft made it clear they needed to rescue the sleeping Radiants. Lift said she could wake them, but they would not be able to fight and she would need a large amount of food. They decided to wait and try to contact the queen.
When the last node was attacked, they triggered their plan. Lift and Teft sneaked to the room where the Radiants were held while Kaladin fought as a distraction. At the door, they were stopped by a Regal who was keeping the crowd out. Teft attacked the Regal and pushed him inside while Lift closed the door. She had to heal Teft when the stormform put a lighting bolt through the Windrunner. Finally, Teft managed to strangle the enemy. While Teft went to seal the door, Lift went to the fallen Radiants to wake them. Before she reached them one of the bodies on the floor leaped up and swung a Shardblade at her and ruined her legs. It was [[Moash\|Moash]]. He kicked Lift to the wall and went on to fight Teft. While Teft fought him, Lift woke and dragged herself to the Radiants. Moash killed one of the Radiants and threatened to kill Lift until Teft took the fight. Moash managed to kill both Teft and his spren.
Lift was bound up and laid next to Kaladin's parents. She was brought to the infirmary with her head bleeding and dead legs. Dabbid tried to give her Stormlight but it did not work. Later, Dalinar remarked she was doing fine, as his lunch was gone. They had found her spren after the tower recovered. Lift and Wyndle were seen carrying around the red chicken.

## Relationships
 by  Shuravf  Lift and [[Wyndle\|Wyndle]]
### Wyndle
>‚Äú*You're my pet Voidbringer, and no lies are going to change that. I got you captured. No stealing souls, now.*‚Äù
\-Lift to Wyndle[1]


[[Wyndle\|Wyndle]] was assigned to Lift by the [[Ring\|Ring]], the ruling body of the [[Cultivationspren\|Cultivationspren]]. The two start off on the wrong foot, as Wyndle doesn't appreciate Lift's particular train of thought, while Lift considers him - perhaps half-jokingly - to be a [[Voidbringer\|voidbringer]]. She enjoys teasing him and making fun of him, and he admits that he'd much rather pick someone calmer to bond, if it was up to him. Though Wyndle knows a lot about [[Realmatic Theory\| Realmatics]] and the mechanisms of Radiance, Lift isn't interested in listening to him, and will sometimes withhold information from him in turn.
Over time, their relationship vastly improves. Wyndle learns to understand what hides beneath Lift's bravado and grows to care for her well-being, while she starts treating him like an actual partner rather than a portable ladder, and eventually stops calling him a voidbringer. By the time of [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Thaylen Field]], the two form a highly capable duo, despite the fact that Wyndle still prefers to transform into a rod rather than a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].

### Yanagawn
Lift met [[Gawx\|Gawx]] when she joined [[Huqin\|Huqin's]] crew in [[Azimir\|Azimir]]. The two infiltrate the Brass Palace together, and when one of [[Nale\|Nale's]] apprentices kills Gawx, Lift rescues him, and the freshly-minted [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] pardons her. This forges a strong bond between the two; following those events, she remains in Azimir at his side, and when she does briefly leave for [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]], he's ready to grant her his authority with the local government. 
By the time [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] begins to curry favour with the Azish, Yanagawn considers her one of his closest and most valuable advisors, even if he must on occasion listen to others; she, in turn, strives to aid him as best she can. While he does have a guard stationed by her quarters as the fleet leaves, he doesn't begrudge her knocking them out and leaving.

### Dalinar

>‚Äú*Your butt is too nice. Old guys shouldn‚Äôt have nice butts. It means they spend way too much time swinging a sword or punching people. You should have an old flabby butt. Then I‚Äôd trust you.*‚Äù
\-Lift to Dalinar[12]


When Lift first sees [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], she is highly mistrustful of him, both because of his past as the Blackthorn and because he is unlike other government official she's familiar with (in her words, "his butt is too nice"). She is more open to listening to him after seeing his first confrontation with [[Odium\|Odium]]. She steals his food when he's waiting for the officials' decision in [[Azimir\|Azimir]]. That he does not begrudge her for it seems to earn him some points with her, and she even agrees to share some of the stolen food back.
Following their face-to-face meeting, Lift's opinion of Dalinar is drastically better. She argues for him with Yanagawn after the Azish choose to pull out of the coalition and is ready to face Odium by his side and follow his orders without question. He, in turn, treats her like another soldier rather than a child, and trusts her to do her job, which might be why she takes a shine to him.

### Szeth and Nightblood
Lift first encounters [[Szeth\|Szeth]] in [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]] as one of Nale's apprentices; she's also the only person known to see the "afterimage" he leaves behind as the after-effect of his resurrection. Her first interaction with [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] has her feel nauseous - the mark of a "good" person according to the sword. Though she and Szeth are nominally on the opposite sides and she considers him exceedingly strange, they aren't hostile to each other, and Szeth wishes her best of luck in attempting to foil Nale.
Lift is one of the few people among the Radiants to trust Szeth. During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|battle of Thaylen Field]] she is happy to work with him and Nightblood on recovering [[Honor's Drop\|Honor's Drop]], and attempts to rescue him when Nightblood begins devouring him. She perceives the sword as having a female voice.

### Nale
The herald [[Nale\|Nale]] has been hunting Lift for some time by the time of the Bronze Palace heist, though she only knows him by a moniker she gave him, "Darkness". As with all non-[[Skybreaker\|Skybreaker]] surgebinders, he's initially highly antagonistic, and attempts to kill her, under the pretense of executing her for thievery. However, he gives up on it after she is pardoned by the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]]. Lift, however, does not forget him, and spends some time attempting to track him down by rumours and reports after he leaves Azimir. When she locates him in Yeddaw, she leaves the palace to find him again and protect other people from him.
It's only in Yeddaw that Lift finds out that Darkness is, in fact, a [[Herald\|Herald]]. After tracking him down again, the two have a confrontation where Lift manages to bring him back to a semblance of sanity and get him to acknowledge that the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] is here. Though she's naturally afraid of him, she's capable of reaching out to him, even giving him a hug as he breaks down. However, his own thoughts on her are unclear.

## Development
Lift is a character that [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] has had in his head for quite a while. She is a classic example of what he is hoping to do with a broader series, such as the [[Stormlight Archive\|Stormlight Archive]]. With the extra space a multi-book series allows, he wanted to create a world full of cultures and characters that are less common in fantasy and science fiction. Lift is an outgrowth of this desire, as Sanderson wanted the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] to be something different than classical European knights -- young, white men swearing oaths of chivalry and valor. Rather, he was looking for a character that would be interesting and popular, but no-one's first idea when they thought of a knight. Lift, a thirteen year old girl on a thieving crew with a weird sense of morality, is the result of that. Sanderson hopes that playing with concepts like these, and stretching our ideas of what a fantasy book and it's characters should look like will allow him to avoid the staleness that is a common complaint in science fiction and fantasy.
Sanderson decided to write an interlude featuring Lift in *Words of Radiance* as a sort of "seed" for her future appearances. She is one of the flashback characters for the second five book arc in the Stormlight Archive, something that Sanderson has planned for a long time. As such, she will become even more prominent as the series continues. Sanderson intends to perhaps even write a few more short stories featuring Lift before he publishes her books.

## Trivia
There are foods Lift hates, but they are hard to find, though bacon is one of them.
Lift sees Wyndle as a slightly longer vine in the Physical Realm than most Edgedancers see their cultivationspren, but the difference is slight.
It is significant that Lift "stopped aging" at 10 years old. 
Lift would be able to steal the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] lunch.
Lift would be very good at video games.
"Lift" is a translation of her name from the original language, which means "to elevate or raise up".
