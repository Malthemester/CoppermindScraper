## History
### During the Final Empire
Before [[Yeden\|Yeden]] hired [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] [[Kelsier's crew\|crew]] to raise an army for the rebellion, [[Marsh\|Marsh]] was their leader. During that time the rebels hid runaways, planned burglaries, organized raids, and kidnapped minor nobles. These rebels never expected to be able to overthrow the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], they just wanted to achieve something grand to give the skaa hope.
During the thousand years of the Final Empire's existence, there had always been skaa rebels. Around the year 700 FE they managed to gather seven thousand skaa and the end result was the [[Tougier\|Massacre of Tougier]]. There has never been a successful massive revolt.
Marsh gave up leadership of the skaa rebellion when Kelsier was sent to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]]. At that time there were about three hundred rebels in and around [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] and the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]], including women and children.
Towards the end of the Final Empire the rebellion was led by a skaa man named Yeden. Yeden hired [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] to help overthrow the Lord Ruler and his empire, and the crew played a vital role in the formation and running of the rebellion's armies during this time.

[[Breeze\|Breeze]] led a team of [[Soother\|Soothers]] and [[Rioter\|Rioters]] to help recruit soldiers from the skaa workers.
[[Ham\|Ham]], who had previous military experience, was in charge of training the new recruits and was the military commander of the rebellion until [[Yeden\|Yeden]] replaced him. 
The soldiers in the rebellion's army were hidden and trained in the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]], near the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] and the [[Kandra Homeland\|Homeland]] of the [[Kandra\|kandra]].
Once [[Yeden\|Yeden]] replaced [[Ham\|Ham]], he led the rebellion on a premature strike against the empire's garrison at the city of [[Holstep\|Holstep]]. As they were returning from their victory there, the garrison from [[Valtroux\|Valtroux City]] caught up with them and ambushed the skaa soldiers, slaughtering everyone.
[[Demoux\|Demoux]] and a small group of about 2,000 soldiers stayed behind in the caverns because they thought [[Yeden\|Yeden]] was "acting rashly". Even though this effectively removed the rebellion from Kelsier's plan, they were eventually smuggled into [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] to help overthrow the [[Luthadel Garrison\|Luthadel Garrison]].

### After the Final Empire
After the death of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] became king of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] and the [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]]. The veterans of the rebellion joined, and formed the backbone of, Elend's army. They fought for Elend during the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]] which culminated in the [[Battle of Hathsin\|Battle of Hathsin]].
