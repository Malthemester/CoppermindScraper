The **Tarat Sea** is a gulf of the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
It is surrounded by the southern coasts of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], [[Triax\|Triax]], [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]], [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]], the northern coast of [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]], and the city-state of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] and opens into [[Longbrow's Straits\|Longbrow's Straits]]. There are a number of islands near the coasts of Triax, Tu Fallia and Greater Hexi. Many of the southern rivers in Alethkar and Jah Keved, including the [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend River]], flow into the Tarat Sea.
The war-room prior to the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] features a map of the gulf, marking the locations of parts of the Azish and Kharbranth fleets. After the battle, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] is sent to find [[Skar\|Skar]], [[Drehy\|Drehy]] and [[Gavinor Kholin\|Gavinor Kholin]] and flies over the gulf from Kharbranth to meet them. During the following year, while [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] is focusing the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] army on recapturing Alethkar, he manages to retake only the part touching the Tarat Sea. This front can be easily resupplied and is strategic to helping reinforce the coalition's navy in that area, but ultimately [[The Mink\|the Mink]] convinces Dalinar and the rest of the coalition to abandon Alethkar for the time being.
