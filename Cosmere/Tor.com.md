## History
The magazine was established in July 2008 and, as of 2014, reported having 1.5 million readers each month. It publishes articles and reviews related to English language science fiction and other speculative fiction, as well as original short science fiction.  Unlike traditional print magazines like *Asimov's* or *Analog*, it releases online fiction that can be accessed free of charge.
Since May 2014, *Tor.com* is also the name of an imprint of Tor Books, dedicated to publishing short fiction such as novellas, short novels and serializations. These are in the form of print-on-demand and audiobook formats in addition to e-books, and are only available for purchase, unlike its free online fiction (which continues to be published). *Tor.com* also has a novel line.

## Reception
[[Gardner Dozois\|Gardner Dozois]] called *Tor.com* "one of the coolest and most eclectic genre-oriented sites on the Internet". He felt in 2011 that its short fiction output that year was weaker than usual, but said it was still a fascinating place to visit. In 2014, *The Guardian*'s Damien Walter remarked on a "digital renaissance" in short SF, and cited a new generation of online magazines, including *Lightspeed*, *Strange Horizons*, *Tor.com* and *Escape Pod*, as having transformed the genre. Of these, he described *Tor.com* as "the reigning champion of science-fiction magazines". He noted the broad range of its output, and said that it had published "many of the most exciting new talents" such as [[Maria Dahvana Headley\|Maria Dahvana Headley]] and [[Karin Tidbeck\|Karin Tidbeck]].
In 2018, Dozois noted that there had been a dramatic resurgence in novellas, with more than 80 published, and attributed the development to *Tor.com* publishing's "ambitious new program". The same year, *The Verge*'s Andrew Liptak called *Tor.com* the publisher of "sci-fi’s most innovative stories", noting the critical acclaim of its output such as [[Nnedi Okorafor\|Nnedi Okorafor]]’s *Binti* and [[Martha Wells\|Martha Wells]]’ *Murderbot* series, which have won [[Hugo Award\|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Awards\|Nebula Awards]].

## Awards
*Tor.com* has won six [[Locus Award\|Locus Awards]] for Best Magazine (2015, 2017–21), breaking a 40-year-long streak where the category was only won by *Asimov's* and *F&SF* (in addition to *Locus* itself). For its art direction, Irene Gallo received the 2014 [[World Fantasy Award\|World Fantasy Award]] for Professional Work.
There have also been several award-winning collections of *Tor.com* content. Reviews and commentary by [[Jo Walton\|Jo Walton]] were collected in the books *What Makes This Book So Great* and *An Informal History of the Hugos*, with the former winning the 2014 Locus Award for Best Non-Fiction, and the latter nominated for the 2019 Hugo and Locus Awards. The fiction anthology, *Worlds Seen in Passing: 10 Years of Tor.com Short Fiction*, won the 2019 [[World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology\|World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology]].
