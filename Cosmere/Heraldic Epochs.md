## History
 by  taratjah 
The Heraldic Epochs began with the conflict between humans and [[Singers\|Singers]], when the latter decided to ally with [[Odium\|Odium]]. To combat this, [[Honor\|Honor]] chose ten [[Herald\|Heralds]], thus forming the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. In short, the Oathpact stated that as long as the Heralds were on [[Braize\|Braize]], Odium could not start another [[Desolation\|Desolation]]; to combat this, he tortured the Heralds until at least one of them broke. A single such cycle - a period of peace punctuated by a Desolation - was a single Heraldic Epoch. As each time, the Heralds broke faster, the Epochs grew shorter and shorter, with the initial ones separated by over a century, while the very last were only years apart. In total, there were somewhere between fifteen and fifty Desolations.
Though initially only the Heralds had the access to [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], eventually the [[Spren\|spren]] sought to mimic those powers and began bonding humans. Initially, those new Surgebinders were unorganized and uncoordinated, with some even turning on fellow men. Sometime during the reign of [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]], the Herald [[Ishar\|Ishar]] imposed order on them, leading to the formation of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Henceforth, the Knights would battle the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] alongside the Heralds.
The city of [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]] was destroyed by unknown means during one of the Desolations, leading to the formation of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Sometime after, a legion of [[Singer\|Singers]] was sent there for unknown reasons and chose to defect, becoming the [[Listener\|Listeners]].
The Heraldic Epochs came to an end with the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]], or the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]]. At the end of that Desolation, only the Herald [[Taln\|Taln]] was dead. The other Heralds decided to leave the Oathpact, theorizing that one of them would be enough to keep it functioning, and abandoned their [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]], then told mankind that this day marked the final victory over the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]]. With them vanishing - supposedly to battle in the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]], while in fact they simply went into hiding - Roshar entered the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Culture and Politics
 by  Isaac Stewart  The [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]]
Though the Heraldic Epochs are considered to be Roshar's golden age, in truth they saw a period of significant civillizational decline. Each [[Desolation\|Desolation]] brought with it a vast loss of knowledge and technical know-how, to the point where the Heralds would leave mankind with the knowledge of forging bronze and return to find them in stone age. With every return, they had to re-teach mankind a number of important skills.
It's possible that this was not merely an accident of constant war, but a deliberate effort by Odium, as the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Yelig-Nar\|Yelig-Nar]] is mentioned as deliberately targeting wordsmen, the literate people of [[Nohadon\|Nohadon's]] era. Even the periods between Desolations were fraught with peril, as creatures such as [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] were a constant threat.
Politically, Roshar was divided into ten [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]]. Each Kingdom had its own purpose in the Desolations, and each had its own [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] leading to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], the seat of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] and the functional capital of the world at the time. Those kingdoms were built by the Heralds and, at least according to myths, led by them. However, smaller countries appear to have existed as well, such as [[Eiliz\|Eiliz]] and [[Tarma\|Tarma]]; whether they were vassal states to the Silver Kingdoms or independent nations that weren't recorded in history is unclear.
Unlike in modern [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], writing and reading wasn't restricted to women, as words*men* existed. Conversely, waging war wasn't restricted to men, as there were female Knights Radiant.

## Legacy
On Roshar, Heraldic Epochs are fondly remembered as the times that Heralds steered the course of the world and men were bound by honor. Great men of that era, such as [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]], are revered even in the present day.
One of the primary tenets of the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] religion states that at the end of the Heraldic Epochs, the Heralds had pushed the Voidbringers back to the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]] and were fighting to force them out of there as well. According to Vorinism, there were one hundred [[Desolation\|Desolations]], including [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]].
