>‚Äú*This is outrageous! The dictates of the Five rule us, not the will of a single person! Can't you see that the form, the new form is overriding her! You've all lost your minds! Or...or worse.*‚Äù
\-Abronai on Eshonai's coup[1]

## Appearance & Personality
>‚Äú*Red eyes. Have we come to this?*‚Äù
\-Abronai on stormform[1]


As Abronai represents the interests of the mates in the Five, he took mateform. In private conversations with Eshonai, Abronai expresses distaste for the form and a desire to switch to another. Abronai appeares plump and lush, like all mates, however he maintains better control over himself than others in mateform.
Abronai wishes that peace could have been reached with the humans when Eshonai meets with [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] in the guise of [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]. However, he cares for his people more, and despite his fears of stormform he initially supports the idea of converting all of the Parshendi into the new form. However, once the changes it has wrought on Eshonai become clearer, Abronai is strongly opposed to the idea.

## History
When the discovery of stormform was put before the Five, Abronai supported [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] in her proposal that she be the first to take on the new form. He believed that since the [[Spren\|spren]] had again returned to grant mankind the ancient powers of [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], as Eshonai witnessed in [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], that the Parshendi also needed to reach for their forms of power.
When Eshonai returned praising the benefits of stormform, Abronai initially agreed that they should have their people take stormform en masse. However, due to Eshonai's new harsh and cruel personality and [[Zuln\|Zuln's]] objections, he became uncertain. Abronai was also still offput by the red eyes of stormform and skeptical about whether it could truly summon a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]].
After Eshonai's words stirred the Parshendi people into rebellion, Abronai was taken into custody with all the other Parshendi who refused to take stormform. He likely escaped with [[Thude\|Thude]] and the rest of the dissenters into the chasms of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
