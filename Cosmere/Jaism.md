## History
### Founding and Growth
Jaism was founded by a single man whose name was lost to history. His followers called him "**The Ja**". The Ja was skilled at preaching discord, and for that he was murdered by a local king. However, this only served to increase his following, and his believers became particularly zealous.
Jaists believed "that they earned happiness proportional to their overt devotion, and they were known for frequent and fervent professions of faith". People outside the faith became frustrated even speaking to Jaists, since they added the phrase "Praise the Ja" to the end of nearly every sentence. Jaism's overall popularity is not known, nor whether it was limited to certain regions of Scadrial.

### Eradication by the Lord Ruler
After the Ascension of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], not a single Jaist would accept the Lord Ruler as a deity. The Lord Ruler therefore had the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]] kill every last adherent of Jaism. Jaists were not difficult for the Ministry to find, as they did not hide their religion despite the threat of death.

## Record
During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], Jaism was included in the [[Terris\|Terris]] [[Keeper\|Keeper]] [[Sazed\|Sazed's]] Portfolio of Religions. Sazed mentioned Jaism to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] when the latter asked to hear about a religion with power. Sazed recognized that while Kelsier might appreciate the brashness of Jaists, their theology was too simplistic for him.
