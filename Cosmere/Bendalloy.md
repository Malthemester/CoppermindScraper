**Bendalloy** is the External Temporal Pushing metal. An Allomancer burning bendalloy is able to squeeze time in a bubble around them, making it pass more quickly. Feruchemists can use bendalloy to store nutritional energy, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, bendalloy steals Spiritual Feruchemical powers. It is an alloy of [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] and bismuth.
Bendalloy is expensive, with one nugget costing around five hundred notes.

## Allomantic Use
A bendalloy [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Slider**. Burning bendalloy pushes on time around the user, causing time to pass more quickly in a bubble around them. Events outside the bubble appear to move much slower to someone inside. One nugget of bendalloy can compress approximately two minutes into fifteen seconds.
When a bendalloy bubble and a [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] bubble occur in the same place, their effects cancel out resulting in no change whilst still burning the metals used. The time bubble created by a Slider is approximately five feet across and is smaller than that possible while burning cadmium. Careful examination may reveal the edge of the bubble, where air appears to shimmer.
When a time bubble is created, the area of the bubble stays stationary with respect to a moving object as long as the Slider creating it is stationed on an object large enough. For example, someone standing on a planet, which is quite massive, is still actually moving with the rotation of the planet, and the bubble moves with that person, but the bubble itself stays in the same place with respect to the planet. However, if the Slider who created a time bubble is on a small, moving object (or the person merely walks to the edge of the bubble), the Slider will be transported through the bubble, "popping" it. Objects entering or exiting the bubble are thrown wildly off-course, most likely because different parts of the object are moving at different speeds during the transition. When leaving the bubble, time bubbles interfere with almost all forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. However, they do not interfere with emotional allomancy. When multiple bubbles occur in the same space their effects are multiplied.
If a Slider flares bendalloy when forming a time bubble, time inside the bubble is sped up even more. The size and speed of the bubble is pretty much determined when it's first formed. Bendalloy is involved in multiple ways with faster-than-light travel.
A speed bubble can be popped by [[Aluminum\|aluminum]].

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of bendalloy needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, they would be able to anchor the speed bubble to themselves, allowing the speed bubble to move with them. This would cause complications for objects moving in and out of the bubble as energy is transferred to and from the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] to prevent redshift and blueshift. They would also be able to influence the size of the bubble and the amount of time it gives.

## Feruchemical Use
A bendalloy [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Subsumer**. Bendalloy is used to store nutrition and calories. While filling a bendalloymind, a Subsumer is able to eat large quantities of food without becoming full. Tapping such a metalmind will allow the user to go without food. A separate bendalloymind can be used to store fluid intake.

### Compounding
A bendalloy [[Compounding\|Compounder]] would be able to use bendalloy to survive without food or water.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, bendalloy steals Spiritual Feruchemical powers ([[Chromium\|chromium]], [[Nicrosil\|nicrosil]], [[Aluminum\|aluminum]], and [[Duralumin\|duralumin]]).

## History
During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] and bendalloy were inaccessible and unknown to Allomancers, though they were possibly known to the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. The fact that their technology couldn't create the metals made Mistings of these types impossible to discover. After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], advancement in technology eventually made the metals available.

## Trivia
In an original mockup of the complete Table of Allomantic Metals, this metal was named cerrobend. However, the word cerrobend was a trademarked, commercial name for the , and so [[Brandon\|Brandon]] was forced to use bendalloy instead.
