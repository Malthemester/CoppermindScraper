**Rithmatics** is a magic system that uses chalk. It was discovered by King [[Gregory III\|Gregory III]], Monarch in Exile of [[Britannia\|Britannia]]. Accordingly the practice of Rithmatics is heavily associated with the [[Church of the Monarch\|Church of the Monarch]], as the [[Inception\|inception]] ceremony by which ordinary people become Rithmatists take place in Monarchical churches..

## Rithmatic Lines
There were four known Rithmatic lines at the start of [[The Rithmatist\|The Rithmatist]]; however, two new lines were discovered over the course of the novel (the Line of Silencing and the Line of Revocation).

 by  Ben McSweeney 
### Line of Warding
The strength of a Line of Warding is determined by its evenness and its curvature. The steeper the curve, the stronger the line. This is a moot point in circles as their curvature is equal around its entirety. In ellipses however the strength is variable; peaking at its bindpoints and reaching its lowest point on the sides.
A larger Line of Warding is weaker, however, it takes more strength for chalklings/Lines of Vigor/Lines of Revocation to destroy 1/6 of a large circle than 1/6 of a smaller one; the strength of all circles is not the same. A typical Line of Warding can take about 6 hits from a Line of Vigor.

### Line of Forbiddance
 by  Ben McSweeney 
A Line of Forbiddance is a defensive line that projects an impenetrable plane perpendicular to the surface it is drawn on. Not even the Rithmatist who drew it is able to cross it. The strength of a Line of Forbiddance is determined by its straightness; the straighter the line is, the stronger it is. The line's thickness determines the height of the invisible plane it produces above it. A well-drawn Line of Forbiddance can stop bullets and, in some cases, cannonballs.
Since Lines of Forbiddance are resistant to being moved by Lines of Vigor, they are useful in anchoring Lines of Warding against being moved. Often a Rithmatist will use a Line of Forbiddance to connect two of a circle's bindpoints.
It takes about four seconds for a Rithmatist to dismiss a Line of Forbiddance they drew themselves.
A "Mark's Cross" is a set of perpendicular Lines of Forbiddance in a four-point circle. It can be attached to a bindpoint of a larger circle for support.
A Line of Vigor will bounce off of a Line of Forbiddance. However, a Line of Forbiddance can only sustain about 10 Line of Vigor hits before it is destroyed.
The material that a Line of Forbiddance is drawn on can affect its stability (e.g., more durable surfaces form stronger lines).
Lines of Forbiddance are weakest at the corners if they are joined together.

### Line of Vigor
 by  Ben McSweeney 
Lines of Vigor are one of the main offensive Rithmatic lines. It is drawn in the shape of a , from the outside in. As long as it completes two intervals it will shoot out until it reaches an obstacle. Most chalklings are easily destroyed by Lines of Vigor. If it reaches a Line of Warding it will create a pockmark, if enough hit the same point then the line could be breached. Lines of Vigor reflect off of Lines of Forbiddance. The strength of a Line of Vigor is based on how large the curve of their wave is. A tighter curve, that puts the same amount of lines in a smaller area is harder to draw, but stronger, than one that has a longer wave.
Lines of Vigor generally behave like light waves: they will reflect off of Lines of Forbiddance and refract upon change of medium. Higher frequency Lines are better at penetrating, while lower frequency Lines are better at energy transfer (i.e. displacing Lines of Warding).

 by  Ben McSweeney 
### Line of Making
For more information, see [[Chalkling\|chalkling]].
Lines of Making are used to create [[Chalkling\|chalklings]]. The strength of a Line of Making is determined by the "complexity and aesthetic beauty" of the chalkling it creates.
Chalklings made with a Line of Making are unable to affect anything that isn't made of chalk unless the Glyph of Rending is added to their instructions.

 by  Ben McSweeney 
### Line of Silencing
The Line of Silencing has the ability to absorb sound waves. The louder a sound is, the more it is dampened, a whisper is essentially immune. It can only absorb a sound if the sound wave is powerful enough to reach it, and it will run out of power after a given time and stop working.
The shape of this line was discovered by [[Trent Saxon\|Trent Saxon]], a chalkmaker. The effect was unknown until [[Joel Saxon\|Joel Saxon]] discovered the use from the [[Scribbler\|Scribbler]].

 by  Ben McSweeney 
### Line of Revocation
The Line of Revocation is described as being a cross between a Line of Forbiddance and a Line of Vigor. It is able to interact with things not made of chalk. It is slightly more powerful than a Line of Vigor.
This line was first demonstrated by the [[Scribbler\|Scribbler]], but was later used by [[Fitch\|Fitch]], [[Joel\|Joel]], and [[Melody\|Melody]].

## Teaching Rithmatics
### Rithmatic Schools
There were eight schools that taught Rithmatics in the [[United Isles of America\|United Isles of America]].

[[Armedius Academy\|Armedius Academy]] in [[Jamestown\|Jamestown]] on [[New Britannia\|New Britannia]]
[[Valendar Academy\|Valendar Academy]] on the [[California Archipelago\|California Archipelago]]
[[Calgarius Academy\|Calgarius Academy]] on [[Albert\|Albert]]
[[Denver Academy\|Denver Academy]] on [[Denver\|Denver]]
[[Maineford Academy\|Maineford Academy]] on [[Maineford\|Maineford]]
[[Acad%C3%A9mie de Montr%C3%A9al\|Académie de Montréal]] on [[Canadia\|Canadia]]
[[Our Lady of the Circle Academy\|Our Lady of the Circle Academy]] on [[Kokomo\|Kokomo]]
[[Academia de la Rueda Divina\|Academia de la Rueda Divina]] on [[New Espania\|New Espania]]
It is mentioned that there was a movement on some of the Isles to open smaller schools on every Isle. The Rithmatic academies felt that this would lead to disunity and widely varied teaching styles, which would be detrimental to unity in [[Tower of Nebrask\|Nebrask]].

### Rithmatic Professors
Professors of Rithmatics wear different color coats depending on their rank. A professor of lower rank can challenge one of a higher rank to a duel, if the challenger wins then the two professors trade ranks.

Tenured Professors wear red.
Non-tenured Professors wear blue.
Assistant Professors wear green.
Tutoring Professors wear grey.
### Rithmatic Students
Rithmatic students wear grey sweaters. Boys wear white slacks and girls wear white skirts. Kneepads are often worn for they need to kneel and draw chalks.

## Rithmatic Defenses
### Four-Point Circles




The four-point circle











The Ballintain Defense











The Sumsion Defense




### Six-Point Circles




The six-point circle




The six-point circle has bindpoints based on a regular hexagon whose vertices are equidistant around the circle's circumference. While it is difficult to determine where the bindpoints are without actually seeing the hexagon, Rithmatists are taught how to intuit their positions. Six-point circles have a greater inherent versatility and defensibility that two- and four-point circles lack.







The Eskridge Defense











The Matson Defense




### Nine-Point Circles




A nine-point circle




The nine-point circle has bindpoints based on a non-obtuse triangle. The bindpoints are located at the midpoint of each side and at the points where the triangle's  lines intersect the circle. They require a great deal of practice in order to successfully determine where each of the bindpoints are located. Due to this difficulty many Rithmatists do not choose to spend the time required to master it.







The Easton Defense














The Shoaff Defense











The Taylor Defense




### Ellipses




The ellipse




Lines of Warding in the shape of an ellipse only have two bindpoints. They are strong at the ends (near the bindpoints) but weak along the sides.



Invented by [[Matthew Jordan\|Matthew Jordan]], it is a defense characterized by the large cage of Lines of Forbiddance drawn around it. Large numbers of offensive chalklings are drawn inside the cage and are released in waves by dismissing the front Line of Forbiddance, which is then redrawn after the chalklings have moved forward. At each of the two bindpoints have a line running through them to serve as an anchor. It requires a great deal of skill in making sure the chalklings wait until the Line is dismissed before moving forward. It is an unconventional defense and some teachers are reluctant to teach it.





The Jordan Defense







The only basic defense based off of an ellipse. A defensive chalkling is bound to the upper bindpoint. The rear bindpoint has a line running through it to serve as the only anchor for the defense. On either side the Rithmatist my choose to add two circular Lines of Warding with a Mark's Cross to aid in defense. It is important though that they do not touch the main ellipse as they would not be touching a bindpoint.





The Osborn Defense




### Unknown Configuration









## Trivia
The Miyabi Defense is named after Miyabi, a longstanding member of Brandon's fan community.
