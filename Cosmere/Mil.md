**Mil** is a man from [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is an older man with a friendly face and a patchwork beard, which he had always wanted to grow out but never managed.

## History
In 1175, Mil was among the residents of Hearthstone that were evacuated from Hearthstone to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on the *Fourth Bridge* due to the occupation of northern Alethkar by [[Singer\|singer]] forces. After taking up residence in the tower, he visited [[Lirin\|Lirin's]] clinic and was treated by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], whom he had known prior to the war. Mil had been suffering from persistent headaches for months and Kaladin thought it might be migraines. Kaladin prescribed him medicine for the pain, and suggested visiting the [[Edgedancers\|Edgedancers]] for [[Regrowth\|Regrowth]] even though it was likely too late to heal him with [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]]. Mil was told to record all his headaches and symptoms for a month; this simple affirmation of his pain made him grin ear to ear.
