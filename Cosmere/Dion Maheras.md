**Dion Maheras** is a dark-haired kid, perhaps eighteen. He has a Mediterranean skin tone. He is an atheist like his brother Panos even though their mom would not accept it. He finished high school and was planning on going to college in the fall. He was fiercely devoted to his older brother, Panos, and decided to stalk [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds]] in order to discover what he knew about Panos's death. He led Stephen to his house to allow Stephen to talk to his mother. Because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, he got captured with Stephen. He feared death.
