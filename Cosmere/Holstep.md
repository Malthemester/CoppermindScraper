**Holstep** was a town in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Geography
It was about an hour north of the [[Luth-Davn Canal\|Luth-Davn Canal]], and by canal a two-week journey from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] to the north. It is near the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]]. [[Valtroux\|Valtroux]] is about three days march from Holstep.

## History
At [[Yeden\|Yeden's]] command, a portion of the [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebellion]] camped in the Arguois caverns attacked the Holstep Garrison at night. About two thousand of the skaa (including [[Demoux\|Demoux]]) declined to join the attack, believing it to be a strategic mistake. Yeden led the remaining five thousand skaa to victory over the much smaller Holstep force of about one thousand, although the fight was more difficult than he had expected.
During the battle, a messenger managed to flee Holstep and reach the nearby city of [[Valtroux\|Valtroux]], which immediately sent its garrison of five thousand soldiers. The [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] learned of the size of the rebel force and also deployed the [[Luthadel Garrison\|Luthadel Garrison]], although they would take more time to reach Holstep. [[Ham\|Ham]] learned of these events from [[Sertes\|Sertes]] and warned [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], but it was too late for him to help. Although the remaining skaa army managed to put up a fight, they were drained from the previous battle and the well-trained Valtroux Garrison overwhelmed them. The Valtroux Garrison took no prisoners, and the heads of Yeden and other officers were put on spears by the road, presumably as a warning to other rebellious skaa. After the Luthadel Garrison arrived, they relieved the Valtroux troops and hunted down any remaining rebels. The only skaa survivors were the group that remained in the caverns.
The battle at Holstep was a serious setback for Kelsier's plans to overthrow the Lord Ruler. He blamed himself for the defeat, and believed that his own enthusiasm and the promise of help from [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]] were the source of Yeden's overconfidence.
