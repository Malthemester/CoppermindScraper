\-Ved to members of his squad[1]


**Ved** is a member of the [[Kholinar Wall Guard\|Kholinar Wall Guard]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] of the tenth dahn, colloquially called a "tenner."
Ved was part of Platoon Seven, Squad Two of the Kholinar Wall Guard during the invasion of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] by the [[Fused\|Fused]]. He and the other members of his squad--[[Beard\|Beard]], [[Noro\|Noro]], [[Alaward\|Alaward]], and [[Vaceslv\|Vaceslv]]--readily accepted [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] as their sixth member. Their normal duties involved patrolling along the inside of the city wall and guarding a shipment of grain from the citizens of the city until [[Velalant\|Velalant's]] troops came to fetch it. Kaladin stood between Ven and Beard during one of [[Azure\|Azure's]] inspections, and during one of the Fused's sorties, Beard and Ved stood together on the wall to fend them off with pikes. Ved and his squad accompanied Azure and Kaladin, at the latter's request, to see the secret of how Azure was feeding the Wall Guard. He was astonished to discover that Kaladin was a [[Knights Radiant\|Knight Radiant]], but he and the rest of the squad followed Kaladin and [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] into [[Kholinar palace\|Kholinar palace]] during the [[Battle of Kholinar\|Battle of Kholinar]]; having lost their [[Deedanor\|captain]], they decided to follow Kaladin instead.
