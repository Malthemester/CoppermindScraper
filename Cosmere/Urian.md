## History
Urian and his brother are among the many new Highprinces in Jah Keved that are appointed by King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] after the previous nobility was wiped out during the Veden War of Succession. Urian's predecessor was poisoned. Dalinar first meets Urian during his brief visit to survey the damage in [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]].
The brothers attend a war council in the [[Gallery of Maps\|Gallery of Maps]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with Taravangian and other leaders of [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] coalition. Urian petitions the council to protect a strip of Veden land to the east of the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] that [[Aladar\|Aladar]] was ready to cede to the [[Singer\|singer]] army. Urian argues that the land has strategic value since it is fertile and protected from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]], and it can be used as a base to recruit [[Horneater\|Horneater]] troops. He also says that it would serve as a staging area for further attacks on Jah Keved were it to fall into enemy hands, and that defending the area will give the rest of the nation needed time to recover. Dalinar has previously fought battles in the region, and agrees with Urian's assessment.
Dalinar soon realizes that [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] is actually the likely target of [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. When he asks if any nations have ships available to head off the enemy fleet, one of the Veden highprinces (presumably Urian) mentions that Taravangian has a number of ships in Vedenar. He cautions that Jah Keved lost hundreds of sailors during the civil war, and may not have enough crew remaining to sail all of the available ships.
