\-Valam's final words[1]


**Valam** is a [[Jah Keved\|Veden]] highprince on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
[[House Davar\|House Davar]] owed Valam fealty. However, around the time of [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar's]] hunt for [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], Valam's health was failing him, and he no longer provided the Davars with the same protection as he used to, which led to Shallan's desperate move to attempt to steal Jasnah's [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]].
He emerged as the ruler of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] after the murder of King [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]] and the other Highprinces by [[Szeth\|Szeth]]. After his victory in the civil war that all but destroyed [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], he was visited on his deathbed by [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], who he named heir to the throne. He then had his bastard son [[Redin\|Redin]] kill him so he would suffer no longer.
