## The Monarch
The head of the Church is a person known as the Monarch. The Monarchs were the original rulers of [[Britannia\|Britannia]], however, King [[Gregory III\|Gregory III]] fled the country with a number of his countrymen when it was invaded by the [[JoSeun\|JoSeun]]. They took refuge in America and Gregory became the Monarch in Exile. To replace the political power he had lost he became a religious leader.

## Rithmatics
>“*Even the most oblivious of men knew of the connection between Rithmatics and the Monarchical Church. No man gained Rithmatic powers without first agreeing to be incepted.*”
\-Joel Saxon[1]


The Monarchical Church has heavy ties to the practice of [[Rithmatics\|Rithmatics]] and, because of this, it is one of the most influential religions in the world. The [[Inception\|inception]] ceremony, which takes place in a special room called the "chamber of inception" in a Monarchical chapel, grants a Rithmatist his or her powers and signifies someone becoming a full member of the Church. Members believe the "hidden touch of the Master" is what transforms people into Rithmatists.

## Symbology
>“*The circle is divine. The only truly eternal and perfect shape, it has been used as a symbol for the Master's works since the ancient Egyptian Ahmes first discovered the divine number itself.*”
\-Journal of Adam Makings[5]


Clockwork is used extensively in Monarchical churches. The [[Jamestown\|Jamestown]] Cathedral's main window is a clock made entirely of stained-glass. It also has a number of clockwork automatons in the shape of various apostles and saints which will occasionally move. The statue of Saint DaVinci for example drew various symbols, such as circles, gears, and triangles, on the floor in front of it. Clockwork gargoyles are also found on the cathedral's roof, patrolling above the entrances.
Rithmatic drawings are another decorative feature in Monarchical churches, especially around depictions of King Gregory III. The  worn by priests of the Monarchical Church depict a nine-point circle overlaid on a cross. The Jamestown Cathedral has, at the point where the two arms of the cathedral meet the main aisle, a circle with pillars set at the bindpoints of a nine-point circle.
