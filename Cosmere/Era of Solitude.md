## Silver Kingdoms
The [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] existed from some time prior to [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]] until likely just after the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]]. The Knights Radiant supported a unified kingdom across the land connecting everyone via [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], with [[Alethela\|Alethela]] being the center of protection for all of the Kingdoms. After the fall of the Knights, and with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] abandoned (leaving each kingdom isolated) they would no longer be able to function as they had.

## Beginning
The Era of Solitude began after the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]] known as [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]]. After being told that the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] had been defeated by the remaining [[Herald\|Heralds]], mankind began rebuilding for the first time in years.

## Events of the Era of Solitude
**Aharietiam** - Began the Era of Solitude.
**The False Desolation** - War with [[Singer\|Singers]] not led by the [[Fused\|Fused]].
**The Day of Recreance** - Knights Radiant broke oaths and abandoned [[Shard\|Shards]].
**The Enslavement of the singers** - This may have happened shortly after the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]].
**The Death of Honor** - Honor was killed and the power he held was splintered by [[Odium\|Odium]].
**The Collapse of the Silver Kingdoms** - While unknown when the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] fell, without the Knights Radiant the system would have broken down by this point.
**The Hierocracy** - Classical [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]] attempted to control the world, much of history was sanitized during this time.
**The Scouring of Aimia** - [[Aimia\|Aimia]] suffered a cataclysm of some kind.
**The True Desolation** - the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] ended the Era of Solitude.
## The End
The Era of Solitude lasted up until the return of the [[Fused\|Fused]] and [[Odium\|Odium]]. This takes place the day the [[Listener\|Listeners]] created the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] the Beginning of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].

## Time Keeping
The current [[Vorin\|Vorin]] calendar in the Era of Solitude did not begin at the end of [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], but a date approximately three thousand years afterward. This date that starts the calendar takes place some time after the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]] but before the [[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]].
