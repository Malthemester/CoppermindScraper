This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
The **Tukari caravan leader** is part of a group of [[Tukari caravaneers\|mercenaries]] who are active in the southern area of the [[Sea of Souls\|Sea of Souls]] and are known to attack [[Spren\|spren]]. He supervises more than twenty men. It is possible the Tukari caravan leader is working for [[Ishar\|Ishar]] and has been tasked to bring him spren bodies that the [[Herald\|Herald]] can use in his experiments.
The Tukari caravan leader is likely ethnically [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]], with brown skin and black hair, and wears clothing from the southeastern makabak region, including a blue-on-yellow patterned overcoat. His features may be hard to make out, likely due to some supernatural means. He may have some level of formal military or battle training.
The Tukari leader is one of the men who attacked [[Notum\|Notum]] after he went south on his patrol. When [[Adolin\|Adolin]] came to Notum’s rescue, the Tukari leader stood back from the fighting and gave orders to the other men in his group. His leadership kept his group of mercenaries fighting after Adolin’s first attack, instead of the other men being scared off by their opponent. The leader eventually lost control over his men when [[Maya\|Maya]] joined the battle. Adolin attempted to attack the Tukari leader, after dodging the leader's bodyguard, however, the Tukari leader dodged at the last moment and only received a gash along his shoulder. After being injured, the leader, along with his remaining men retreated to their caravan before departing the area.
