## History
Both Winzik and [[Cuna\|Cuna]] devised the fighter program to deal with the delvers. However, they had different methods of going about it. Winzik had his own secret agenda, wanting to control the delvers to threaten other planets with them to keep them in line, while Cuna wanted to more fully integrate "lesser" species into the Superiority.

>“*My my, so aggressive. Emissary, do you know the danger you pose to us? To your own people? Do you know that by doing what you do, you could cause great destruction?*”
\-Winzik to Spensa upon learning of her cytonic abilities[1]

When Spensa arrived on Starsight for the new pilot training program, Winzik met her, along with Cuna and [[Brade\|Brade]]. Winzik had Brade check Spensa for cytonic abilities, and Winzik then told Spensa about the regulations on cytonics on Starsight. Spensa agreed to the rules. When the prospective pilots were trying out for the new fighter force, Winzik was there to give a speech and personally oversee the tryouts. He gave Spensa a temporary identification number when she didn't have one, and briefly tried to discourage her from participating in the trial. Winzik detailed the rules of the practice battle, and told them to drop out if they felt excessive amounts of aggression or recklessness during the fight. The drones they used in the fight used live fire, and twelve ships were destroyed during the exercise. Several of the pilots were furious, and one [[Burl\|burl]], [[Gul'zah\|Gul'zah]], angrily shouted at Winzik. Winzik calmly reprimanded Gul'zah for their aggression, and the burl was taken away by [[Dione\|dione]] security members.

>“*All right, everyone! Welcome and thank you for your service! We at the Department of Protective Services are very excited to be training this new bold force. You will be our first line of defense against a danger that has loomed above the Superiority for its entire existence.*”
\-Winzik to the members of the delver program[6]

Winzik also directed the new pilots as they first trained on the delver maze. When Spensa called him to ask about the images she was seeing in the maze, Winzik replied that they didn't truly how the maze worked, since they didn't design it. When the Department of Protective Services came under fire for not keeping the humans on Detritus well contained, Winzik insisted that the extent of the humans' strength was exaggerated. The training of the pilots in the delver program continued, and numerous Superioirty officials showed up to watch one day. Winzik made the challenges more difficult for Spensa's flight, wanting to show off Brade's skill to the officials. It was revealed during that day of training how Winzik planned to deal with delvers. Brade had been training to divert delvers, and Winzik's plan was to direct an oncoming delver towards an enemy planet, using the pilots in the delver program as a diversionary force. His first target was planned to be Detritus.

### Attack on Detritus
>“*Your job will be to destroy their forces. This should prove to be an excellent display of why the Superiority needs a more active and well-trained defense force.*”
\-Winzik to his group of pilots[10]


After weeks of exercises and training, Winzik ordered all of his pilots to report to the [[Weights and Measures\|Weights and Measures]] for an attack on Detritus, intending to finish the humans off once and for all. When Spensa revealed her nature as a human to Brade, Brade immediately yelled and told Winzik. As Spensa escaped towards Detritus, Winzik diverted forces to chase her down. Winzik broadcasted his attack to the people back on Starsight, planning to bring a delver to Detritus and destroy the humans completely. With the humans growing stronger and freer, they would make him and his department look inept. So he intended to solidify his reputation and his strength. While the fight was occurring, he also ordered Spensa's embassy raided, and [[M-Bot\|M-Bot]] was stripped down and mostly destroyed. He had Brade scream repeatedly into the nowhere, agitating the delvers and causing one to arrive.
Winzik's plan failed after Spensa redirected the delver to Starsight, and eventually sent it back to the nowhere. Trials were arranged for Winzik, with conflicting views in the Superioirty government about his actions. He still had some support, and he claimed that the humans had summoned the delver to Detritus, and that Morriumur was a hero. Many, including Cuna, didn't believe him.

>“*I have been warning about this threat for months, and have been disregarded. The humans should never have been allowed to fester. All these years, the high minister and the Department of Species Integration tied my hands, preventing me from doing what needed to be done.*”
\-Winzik on a broadcast during his coup[15]

While Cuna was visiting Spensa in the hospital, Winzik staged a military coup on Starsight. He had his soldiers try and capture Cuna and Spensa, but Spensa managed to hide Cuna and escape the hospital. Winzik saw Spensa as a threat, and wanted her killed. After Brade blew up a Superiority transport on what was likely Winzik's orders, Winzik made it sound like Spensa had gone rogue, killing Minister Cuna and shooting at civilians. He used this as evidence to say that the humans really were the dangerous monsters he'd always said they were. He petitioned for a state of emergency to be declared, and for himself to be given the power to eliminate the humans.
