**Laran** is a messenger in [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] army turned Windrunner of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]].
At some point in Laran's past she joined the Kholin army as a messenger. She was quite able in this role; some believed her to be the fastest of the messengers.
She likely tried out for Bridge Four with [[Lyn\|Lyn]] and the other female scouts and messengers from House Kholin at [[Narak\|Narak]] in 1174, and may have learned to draw in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] then. After the discovery of the attack on the Bridge Four barracks in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Lyn\|Lyn]] tasked Laran with running to the guard post and fetching [[Renarin\|Renarin]] to heal the wounded. After the battle itself, [[Lopen\|Lopen]] told Laran and Lyn an exagerated version of the story of how he lost his arm.
In the following year, Laran bonded one of the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] that had chosen to help refound the Windrunners and swore her first two [[Immortal Words\|Ideals]]. She accompanied the *Fourth Bridge* during its evacuation of Hearthstone and fought the shanay-im that confronted them there. Towards the end of the battle, she swore her Third Ideal and her spren manifest as a Blade for the first time. As with many Windrunners, the third ideal was difficult for Laran. Following the battle, she presented her spren to Kaladin in Blade form and he congratulated the pair on their accomplishment.
