**Valkyrie Flight** is a part of the [[DDF\|DDF]]. The Flight participates in the [[Second Battle of Alta\|Second Battle of Alta]] and provides cover to try and drive the [[Varvax\|Krell]] away from the falling shipyard. The flightleader of Valkyrie Flight died during the battle and the remaining flight members were absorbed immediately into a different Flight.
When the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] sent their battleship forward to begin bombarding [[Detritus\|Detritus]], Valkyrie Flight was one of the flights sent up to fight off the Krell so that [[FM\|FM]] could disable the cannon. Valkyrie Flight and [[Victory Flight\|Victory Flight]] preformed the task of clearing a pathway to the battleship, letting [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] follow in their wake. When FM began to shoot at the cannon, Valkyrie Flight and Victory Flight nipped at the Krell’s heels, distracting them from getting to FM. Eventually there were too many Krell, and FM had to retreat. When the battleship began firing, Valkyrie Flight retreated back to [[Platform Prime\|Platform Prime]] with the other flights on [[Matthew Cobb\|Cobb’s]] orders.
