The **Simulacrum of Paralet** is a statue in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] close to the temple of [[Battah\|Battah]].
It represents an unknown human figure, large enough to require several people to carry its parts and a set of ropes to pull them up.
During [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] introductory tour of the city, he notices it has fallen over and off a ledge into the Loft Wards, presumably during one of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorms]], leaving behind only feet. When his group reaches them, Queen [[Fen\|Fen]] mentions that it's one of the local highlights before noticing the damage. After Dalinar fixes the temple of [[Talenelat\|Talenelat]] with his [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] powers, he leads Fen's son [[Kdralk\|Kdralk]] and a team of ten men back to the Simulacrum to heal the parts of it back into a whole.
