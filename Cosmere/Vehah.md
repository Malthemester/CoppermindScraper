**Vehah** is a traditional wrestling style in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It may be the only type of wrestling commonly practiced in the country, as "wrestling" appears to refer to vehah by default.

## Rules and Strategy
In a traditional vehah match, the participants wear only sparring leggings; grabbing the opponent's hair or leggings is prohibited. A match starts with the participants standing, but eventually moves to the ground; it is advantageous to control how that happens.

## History
After the Alethi armies moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] was craving a physical challenge and headed to the practice grounds. He engaged in a vehah match with [[Aratin Khal\|Aratin Khal]], who had not lost in months. Dalinar enjoyed the simplicity of the struggle, but noted that he was out of practice and his reactions were a bit slow. Aratin gained the advantage, pinning Dalinar to the ground; Dalinar momentarily considered reaching for the [[Thrill\|Thrill]] or using [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], but thought better of it. Despite Aratin's youth and leverage, Dalinar seemed to be close to breaking Aratin's grip when [[Navani Kholin\|Navani]] interrupted the match. Dalinar acknowledged that Aratin was the victor, but quietly claimed to Navani that he "almost had him anyway".
