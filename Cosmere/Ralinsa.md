The **Ralinsa** is the main roadway of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]].
The Ralinsa consists of switchbacks that crisscross the steep [[Lait\|lait]] that contains Kharbranth. It connects the port at sea level to the [[Conclave\|Conclave]] at the top of the city. Because Kharbranth is so steep and crowded, merchants sometimes use porters instead of [[Chull\|chull]] carts to transport their goods through streets and walkways. Wealthy [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] often travel the Ralinsa in palanquins.
While the Ralinsa itself is safe, it has turnoffs to less desirable areas frequented by thieves and footpads.
