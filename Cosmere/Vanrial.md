>“* Anak malah kaf, del makian habin yah*”
\- A line from the Dawnchant, meaning, "To be human is to want that which we cannot have."[1]


The **Vanrial** were an order of artists on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who lived on the slopes of the [[Silent Mount\|Silent Mount]] in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. For centuries they sang a song in a language whose meaning had been lost. The Vanrial claimed that the song had been given to them by the [[Herald\|Heralds]]. Some evidence suggested that the lyrics themselves were in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]].
There is also a theory that was known as the **Vanrial Hypothesis**; what it postulates is unknown.
The Vanrial were also responsible for preserving the full text of [[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]] from earlier times in Roshar's history when many other classical works were lost.
