Lord **Chapmot Heviers** is a member of the [[Argien-Ohr Financial Circle\|Argien-Ohr Financial Circle]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] who has strong ties to [[Corbeau\|Corbeau]].
After [[Paalm\|Paalm]] broke a nearby dam, causing the flooding of [[Corbeau\|Corbeau]], Lord Heviers and the other members of the Circle convened an emergency meeting to discuss sending aid to the ravaged region. Later, in a statement to the *The House Record*, he stated that Elendel had enough supplies in reserve to last four months, after which grain would start going to the highest bidder. He predicted that bakers would start producing whiskey instead of bread as there was a larger profit to be made that way.
