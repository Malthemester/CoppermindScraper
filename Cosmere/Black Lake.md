The **Black Lake** is a large lake near the border of the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]] and [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]] of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] prior to the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. It is located southeast of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] and northeast of the [[Ashmount\|Ashmount]] Faleast. [[Vin\|Vin]] reads about a black lake in [[Alendi's journal\|Alendi's journal]], this seems to be referring to something other than the modern Black Lake.
