>“* This Wall Guard, this is redemption. If you fight here, nobody will care what you did before. Because they know if we fall, this city and this nation will be no more.*”
\- Azure[1]


The **Kholinar Wall Guard** is one of three military forces stationed in the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] capital of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], alongside the [[Queen's Guard\|Queen's Guard]] and [[Palace Guard\|Palace Guard]]. They are responsible for patrolling the city wall and standing watch over its gates. It is composed entirely of [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] of lower [[Dahn\|dahn]], organized into four battalions, and commanded by a Highmarshal.

## History
 by  Petar Penev  During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]
Some members of the Wall Guard were present when [[Taln\|Taln]] arrived at Kholinar to bring news of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].
At the start of the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], the Guard's commander died when trying to quell the riots, while their highborn patron went to speak with Queen [[Aesudan\|Aesudan]] in the [[Kholinar palace\|Kholinar palace]], never to be seen again. When the [[Cult of Moments\|Cult of Moments]] attempted to storm one of the gates, [[Azure\|Azure]] stepped up and took charge. Afterwards, she became the Wall Guard's new Highmarshal, although her men pretended that she was a man to circumvent their [[Vorin\|Vorin]] sensibilities.
Azure rallied the Wall Guard and led them to seize the city's emerald reserves, as well as to attack one of the city's monasteries to acquire a [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]]. She cut out a chamber underneath the city and lined it with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] to prevent the [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] from detecting the work done there, then placed [[Ithi\|Ithi]] and her sister there to Soulcast rock into grain. By the time [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and his team arrived in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], the sisters were Kholinar's only remaining food source.
At that time, the Wall Guard was actively recruiting any [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] who could wield a weapon, regardless of whether they were deserters, or even criminals, using free meals as an incentive to join. When they attempted to recruit Kaladin, he agreed, hoping to learn where the city's food was coming from. He eventually revealed himself to them as a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and informed them about king [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] presence in the city, then rallied them to join his group in an assault on the Kholinar Palace.
During the fighting, the Wall Guard suffered tremendous losses, especially when they began to clash with the [[Listener\|listeners]] as they assaulted the city. After their attack failed, Azure was dumped into [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] along with Kaladin, [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Adolin\|Adolin]], while the surviving Guard members were captured and imprisoned by the [[Fused\|Fused]].
