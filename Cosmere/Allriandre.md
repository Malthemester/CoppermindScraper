**Allriandre** is a student in her late teens in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. Her father was killed by [[Wayne\|Wayne]].

## History
She was presumably born in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]; her father was a bookkeeper in [[Far Dorest\|Far Dorest]]. Her father was a good man who regularly performed charity work, but Wayne accidentally killed him during an attempted mugging when he was sixteen years old. Wayne learned about the man's family, including Allriandre and her two siblings, during his trial. He began giving her family half of his earnings as a means of atonement. The children sometimes wrote him angry letters to let him know that he was not forgiven.
Allriandre attended [[Elendel University\|Elendel University]] and lived in Pashadon Hall, a girls' dormitory. She was considering going into law. Wayne visited Allriandre on the first of each month to bring her a stipend, at her mother's request. Allriandre carried an evanotype picture of her father in a locket and forced Wayne to look at it and acknowledge that he killed him. She always looked at Wayne with a frosty emotionless expression.

## Trivia
Wayne's scene with Allriandre is purposefully awkward and is intended to demonstrate Wayne's deep-seated emotional need to prove that is he a good person.
She may be named after [[Allrianne Cett\|Allrianne Cett]] and/or [[Beldre\|Beldre]], as the [[Originators\|Originators]] had achieved legendary status by the time of her birth hundreds of years after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
