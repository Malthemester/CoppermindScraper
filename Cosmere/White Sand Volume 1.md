## Cover Synopsis
*On the planet of Taldain, the legendary Sand Masters harness arcane powers to manipulate sand in spectacular ways.

## Plot Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[White Sand Volume 1/Summary\|/Summary]].
[[Kenton\|Kenton]], a weak but skilled [[Sand mastery\|sand master]], tries to earn a higher ranking position in the guild of sand masters by running the [[Mastrell's Path\|Mastrell's Path]], despite the disapproval of his [[Praxton\|father]], the Lord Mastrell. The day after Kenton proves himself on the Path, the sand masters gather for a ceremony where new rank advancements will be granted. One man, [[Drile\|Drile]], is demoted for having attempted to sell out himself and a group of others as mercenaries. Just as Kenton is grudgingly granted the highest rank, his father is shot with an arrow, and an army of [[Kerzta\|Kerztian]] warriors attacks. The sand masters, being surprised and unprepared, are soundly defeated. Just before his death, the Lord Mastrell unleashes a wave of power that leaves Kenton buried beneath the sand.
After waking, Kenton is joined by [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]], [[Baon\|Baon]], and two Darkside professors who are lost. They are searching for information about Khriss' late fiance and the "sand mages" he sought. On the way to the nearest city, they are attacked by a small group of Kerztian warriors. Kenton's sand mastery suddenly proves to be inaccessible, but Baon drives the warriors away with his gun.
Upon arriving in [[Kezare\|Kezare]], Kenton's powers return with greater strength than ever, and he stands before the [[Taishin\|Taishin]], who plan to disband the [[Diem\|Diem]] of sand masters. He is granted the position of acting Lord Mastrell, and is given two weeks to convince the Taishin otherwise. Kenton returns to the Diem and drives away the rebellious Drile, who Kenton believes was responsible for betraying the sand masters to the Kerztians. Elsewhere, Trackt Ais works to catch a crime lord, Sharezan, amid threats to her family. The Lady Judge meets with Ais and asks her to spy on Kenton. Meanwhile, Khriss inadvertently locates [[Loaten\|Loaten]], an infamous Darksider, in her search for information. He offers little direct help, but sets her on a path to meet with the leaders in the city. Ignorant of the role of the sand masters, and of Kenton's new station, she arrives at the Diem just as Drile returns to do battle with Kenton.

## Trivia
An excerpt from the first chapter of this graphic novel can be found in [[Arcanum Unbounded\|Arcanum Unbounded]] alongside the original [[White Sand (prose)\|prose]] source material for that section.
In Chapter 2 when Kenton wakes up after his fight with the [[Sandling\|sandling]] there is a boombox in the tent behind him. [[Brandon\|Brandon]] has confirmed that this is not canonical as the residents of Taldain had not yet reached that level of technology at the time of the story. [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] said that the artist who colored the graphic novel misunderstood the line art and that there was not enough time to change it before the book went to print. He also said that when they put out a second edition of the book this and the other inconsistencies will be fixed.
