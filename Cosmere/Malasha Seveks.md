**Malasha Seveks** is a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] woman on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who was courted by [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]].

## Appearance and Personality
Malasha is likely [[Alethi\|Alethi]] since she was present in the warcamps in the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. She wears her hair up in braids and is considered to be very nice looking.
She is curious about war and asks Adolin if she can accompany him to the battlefield; she becomes annoyed when he will not let her come. Dalinar considers a woman desiring to watch the fighting to be "unnatural". Malasha's interest in war is indeed unusual given Adolin's description of her as "rather religious", since the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] work *Arts and Majesty* expressly defines combat as a masculine art.

## History
Adolin started courting Malasha in 1173 shortly after [[Janala Lustow\|Janala Lustow]] grew bored of him. Malasha was religious, and Adolin liked her enough to spend time listening to readings from *The Arguments*. However, Malasha started to grow cold towards Adolin after he refused to satisfy her curiosity by taking her with him on a plateau run. Adolin still seemed interested, but also became intrigued by [[Danlan Morakotha\|Danlan Morakotha]]. Malasha and Adolin broke up a short time later.
