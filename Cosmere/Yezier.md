## Geography
Yezier lays in the western part of the geographical region known as [[Makabak\|Makabak]], in the south-west of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It's bordered by [[Desh\|Desh]] to the North, [[Azir\|Azir]] to the East, and [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] and [[Liafor\|Liafor]] to the South. Its western border sits on an unnamed river, which it shares with [[Alm\|Alm]], while in north-east, it reaches the [[Misted Mountains\|Misted Mountains]] separating it from [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. It claims about 396 thousand square kilometers of land, making it the fifth largest state in the Azish Empire, and the seventeenth largest country on Roshar as a whole.
Like most Makabaki states, Yezier appears to be rather dry and sparsely-populated. Other than its border with Alm, there are no major rivers there, and no settlements worth noting.

## History
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Yezier was part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. It's unknown when they split off. Eventually, they joined a Makabaki coalition under the leadership of the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]], becoming a client state to the [[Azir\|Azish Empire]].
Following the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] sought to persuade them to join his coalition, hoping that they would help convince other states in the region. While he managed to speak with their princess, she demured, awaiting the decision of the Prime Aqasix. After the Azish agreed to join, Yezier followed suit, with the princess herself coming to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
Shortly before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the Azish withdrew from the coalition; however, Yezier remained, and the princess sought to tie herself and her country closer to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. This might've been partially motivated by [[Iri\|Iri]] defecting to Odium, as Yezier was worried about being invaded by them.

## Politics and Culture
Yezier is a member of the [[Azir\|Azish Empire]], and as such subject to the rule of the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]]. However, the country has rulers of its own - currently, an unnamed princess. Recently, she began courting [[Halam Khal\|Halam Khal]], one of [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] highlords, although she cannot marry him without the Prime's permission.
Yezier is traditionally very close to Azish throne, and the princess is noted to live in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] for half of every year.
The country has no [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]]. It's unknown whether they possess any [[Shardwielding\|Shards]], though ordinarily they, like any other member state, can borrow the Imperial [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] of Azir. Whether that still holds true during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] is unknown.
They are known for their [[Stormwarden\|stormwardens]] and timekeepers. Along with the neighboring country of [[Liafor\|Liafor]], they are one of the centres of fashion on Roshar, and have been for decades. Their likely speak one or more of the Makabaki languages.
Their name might be derived from Yaezir, the name used for [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] across [[Makabak\|Makabak]].

## Notable citizens
