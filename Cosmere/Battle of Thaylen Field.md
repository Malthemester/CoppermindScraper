## History
### Preparations
 by  Marie Seeberger  Human and singer forces facing off
Several thousand [[Singer\|Singers]] arrived at the shores of [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] under the protection of an [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], spawned by [[Odium\|Odium]] to mask their invasion and hasten their ships. As sailing during a storm was considered impossible, the human defenders of the city were caught unaware; furthermore, due to [[Taravangian\|Taravangian's]] manipulations, much of the city's defense force had departed it shortly before, leaving only the [[Thaylen\|Thaylens]] and a portion of Alethi army under [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]]. The Everstorm covering the advance of the enemy stalls over the city instead of continuing on, something never seen before.
At the same time, the souls of approximately ten thousand [[Singer\|singers]] gathered outside the [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. Due to the stalled Everstorm, the Voidbringer souls were able to pass into the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], with two going into the ground and ripping themselves free to become [[Thunderclast\|thunderclasts]]. In addition, clad in a body made of golden carapace and clutching a regal scepter, Odium himself stepped onto the shore to personally lead the battle.
Even with such might backing them, some of the [[Fused\|Fused]] expressed doubt over their chances of victory, largely due to the inexperience of their army of freed [[Parshmen\|Parshmen]], many of whom did not want to fight at all. With Amaram's forces being veterans of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] campaigns, the battle was believed to be winnable or even favorable to the humans. Odium, however, had different plans.

### Nergaoul arrives
In the form of blood red mist, occasionally manifesting into images of combat, the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] took to the battlefield and filled Sadeas troops with the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], imbuing them with bloodlust and the urge to fight above all else. It was then that the voidspren that had come through the Oathgate into the physical realm seized new hosts, possessing humans as they could normally do to singers; something that had never happened in previous desolations. With this, the Alethi army turned against the city they were supposed to protect.
At the same time, Odium ordered one of the thunderclasts, [[Yushah\|Yushah]], to assault the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]] to deny the enemy the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]], a [[Perfect gemstone\|perfect gemstone]] capable of capturing an [[Unmade\|Unmade]]. Yushah breached the wall and broke apart the entire building, scattering all the gemstones onto the battlefield.
Taking his copy of *The Way of Kings* under his arm, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] went alone to meet the enemy. Before the [[Azish\|Azish]] forces left the city, sailing to [[Vtlar Cove\|Vtlar Cove]] to wait out the storm, [[Lift\|Lift]] attacked her [[Vono\|guard]] and snuck back to the city, since she was unwilling to abandon the others. When she reached Dalinar he instructed her to track down and recover the King's Drop from the Fused who had taken it. At the same time, [[Szeth\|Szeth]], hovering above the city along with [[Nale\|Nale]], chose to swear the Third Ideal of the [[Skybreaker\|Skybreakers]], picking Dalinar as the ideal to follow. With this, he joined the battle, unsheathing [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] to bring its full might onto the enemy and aid Lift.

### Unity
Despite the powerful combatants involved on the human side, Odium's forces were winning. Odium and Dalinar met in the midsts of the battlefield, with [[Venli\|Venli]] observing as Dalinar challenged Odium to the contest of champions to have a chance at saving the city. Odium agreed, then explained how he had been grooming Dalinar for years to become Odium's own champion.
With this, Odium unleashed the full might of the Thrill upon Dalinar, bombarding him with pain of his past actions and promising reprive if Dalinar gives in. Dalinar, however, refuses, accepting the responsibility instead. With this, he managed to attain the next [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] ideal, declaring "I am Unity" and summoning [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]]. All three realms, physical, cognitive, and spiritual were united in an outpouring of [[Gloryspren\|gloryspren]] and [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], infusing every gem in the city and forming a passage to [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. His allies trapped there -- [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] -- use to return to the Physical Realm and join the fight. By contrast, seeing Dalinar's feat, Odium fled, leaving his armies to fend for themselves.

### The tide turns
Shallan, using [[Illumination\|Lightweaving]], created an illusory army to distract the Sadeas forces, even managing to give the phantoms some substance. Meanwhile, [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] used the near-infinite Stormlight to annihilate the enemy forces with [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], while [[Renarin\|Renarin]], having revealed his [[Glys\|corrupted spren]], rushed to join the fight.
In the center, with Dalinar no longer a possible ally, the sphere containing [[Yelig-Nar\|Yelig-Nar]] went to Amaram, who attacked Dalinar, only to be rebuffed by Kaladin. Amaram then chose to bond [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]] by swallowing a gem, growing grotesque carapace under his [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and gaining access to all ten [[Surge\|Surges]].
With Kaladin handling all threats to Dalinar, the latter made his way into the center of the red mists that made up Nergaoul. In the sky, Szeth, with the help of Lift, had finally acquired the King's Drop, but was immediately tailed by numerous flying [[Fused\|Fused]]. Unable to escape them, he and Lift devised a strategy to fool them, and, with Shallan's help, created a fake King's Drop, which they then allowed the Fused to "steal" back. With the perfect gemstone thus secured, Lift entered the mist to bring it to Dalinar.
Meanwhile, Adolin, with the help of his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]] and Thaylen highguard [[Hrdalm\|Hrdalm]], engaged [[Kai-garnis\|Kai-garnis]], the other thunderclast, near the city's [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. Though Adolin managed to seriously wound the creature, he eventually sustained too many injuries to fight effectively. It's then that Renarin arrived with healing and his own Blade. He and Hrdalm, the latter armed with Mayalaran, finally managed to bring the beast down, reducing it to inanimate stone. Renarin then made for the Oathgate, only to see it guarded by a dozen flying Fused.

### Confronting the Thrill
 by  Ashley Coad  Dalinar confronts Nergaoul
Over in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], a surprise attack aimed at distracting the Alethi from sending reinforcements had been underway until [[Teft\|Teft]] managed to speak his Third Ideal and manifest a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], allowing him to open the Oathgate to Thaylen City and bring in much-needed reinforcements. There, the light of the activated gate momentarily scattered the Fused giving the new arrivals an advantage of surprise. At the same time, back at the ships the singers had arrived upon, [[Venli\|Venli]] bonded [[Timbre\|Timbre]], becoming the first singer [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]].
Within Nergaoul's mists, Lift reached Dalinar and delivered the King's Drop. Embracing the Thrill, Dalinar lured Nergaoul in, and used the Drop to trap him, removing him from the battlefield. With this, the soldiers of Sadeas' army returned to normal, either fleeing or collapsing in place.
Outside, Kaladin's battle with Amaram was still underway. He's almost killed after he runs out of Stormlight, but is saved by [[Rock\|Rock]], who killed Amaram with two shots from a Shardbow. With their last major fighter gone, [[Odium\|Odium's]] army retreated, while Kholin forces and the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]] swept the city of the last invaders. The day was won.
