## Appearance and Personality
When Talik meets with [[Rysn\|Rysn]], he is wearing the wrap and tassels common on Relu-na, leaving his tan shoulders bare, and has his hair in two braids. He speaks Thaylen so flawlessly that Rysn feels the need to check him for Thaylen eyebrows.
He appears to have a curt, imperious personality during the negotiation with Rysn, although that may simply be part of the act he puts on as part of his plan with Vstim.

## History
### Reshi Isles
Talik was born to the king and king's consort of Relu-na. His parents sent him to Thaylenah to train with [[Vstim\|Vstim]] as his [[Babsk\|babsk]] when he was a child; he finished his apprenticeship, becoming a trademaster, and returned to the island to interpret for the king and negotiate trade with outsiders.
Before Vstim and Rysn visit Relu-na, Talik and Vstim agree to fabricate a tough, high-stakes trading situation as practice for Rysn. Unfortunately, it goes wrong when Rysn, desperately wanting to complete the trade, paralyzes herself by jumping off the island and falling into the ocean.

### Rysn's Journey to Akinah
Prior to Rysn departing, Talik met with her in her office in Thaylenah. He offered Rysn advise in regards to the ailing [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri]], telling her that she must take Chiri-Chiri to the lost city of [[Akinah\|Akinah]], in [[Aimia\|Aimia]].
