**The Counselor's Cup** is a pub in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] located on Edden Way.

## Appearance & Staff
It sits on the corner of an intersection and is surrounded by taller tenancy buildings. The bouncer is presumably a [[Koloss\|kolossblood]]. The bar had a picture of [[Edgard Ladrian\|Breeze]] hung behind it. It was lit by gas lamps.

## History
During a firefight, [[Wax\|Wax]] told [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] to escape and meet up at the Counselor's Cup. He gets sidetracked and sends [[Wayne\|Wayne]] in his place. When Wayne arrives he helps calm down the tension by mixing cocktails for the other patrons. MeLaan is impressed by this and they drink together. When Wax and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] arrive, they're having a belching competition. They discuss [[Paalm\|Paalm's]] skills and abilities. Before leaving Wax checks that the tab is paid and is surprised that Wayne had already settled it.
