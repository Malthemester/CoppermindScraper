The **Siege of Mokia** was a long lasting engagement between the [[Free Kingdoms\|Free Kingdoms]] and the [[Librarian\|Librarians]].
The [[Librarian\|Librarians]] had besieged [[Mokia\|Mokia]] for many years until [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz]], [[Bastille\|Bastille]], [[Kaz\|Kaz]], and [[Aydee Ecks Smedry\|Aydee Ecks Smedry]] arrived. [[Talakimallo\|Talakimallo]] had supposedly been sent somewhere safe, but rather than leave his people, he sent his daughter to use [[Disguiser's Lenses\|Disguiser's Lenses]] to impersonate him and escape. The Shielder's Glass surrounding the city was nearly shattered, and Talakimallo was about to surrender, but Alcatraz successfully convinced him to keep fighting. They used [[Communicator's Glass\|Communicator's Glass]] to convince the Nalhallans to send support, and [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry]] was sent with a fleet. But then, the Librarians emerged from a tunnel and attacked the city, putting Talakimallo in a coma. Since the king was no longer available, Alcatraz was the highest ranking person present, and was named leading monarch. Through a clever manipulation of Leavenworth's Talent, he was able to speed up the reinforcements, but it wasn't enough. The Shielder's Glass was broken, and Bastille was injured. His emotions building up inside him allowed him to use the breaking [[Smedry Talent\|Talent]] to break the Librarian weapons, causing the Librarians to give up and leave. However, at the end no one in the Smedry clan could activate their Talent, including Alcatraz.

## Weapons
The Mokians used spears that put the [[Librarian\|Librarians]] into comas, while the Librarians did likewise with their coma-inducing guns. Each side has a secret antidote. The Mokians also had grenades in the shape of teddy bears, color coded to have various effects, such as pulling things toward them, or annihilating all inorganic material in range.
