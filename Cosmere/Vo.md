The man called **Vo** is known to be the first to ever [[Returned\|Return]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], during the time when the people of Chedesh were first discovering the valley where [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] would later come to be. He Returned in the bay of Hallandren and died a week later, declaring the [[Five Visions\|Five Visions]] within that time. 
His shipmates founded the kingdom of [[Hanald\|Hanald]] in the valley, choosing Vo's wife to be their queen. She would go on to establish a royal line, bearing the blood of Vo, which would continue to be in power in Hallandren until the [[Manywar\|Manywar]]. By the end of that conflict, the royal line would leave Hallandren and establish itself in the highlands, eventually coming to rule the kingdom of [[Idris\|Idris]].
Returned are normally unable to bear children, and the method by which Vo was able to circumvent this is unknown. Siri assumes that it is impossible, and that the story of Vo fathering a child was fabricated in order to legitimize the royal line of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. [[Vasher\|Vasher]] mentions to [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] that the royal locks [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] exhibits are proof that she is indeed descended from a Returned, and that she has a piece of a Returned in her.
It is indeed possible for Returned to bear children by some special means which have not been revealed yet, and the priesthood of the God King is aware of how to do so.
