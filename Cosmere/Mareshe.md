**Mareshe** was an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] from [[Sel\|Sel]] after the [[Reod\|Reod]].

## Appearance
Mareshe was taken by the [[Shaod\|shaod]] and deposited in Elantris. He was the first person [[Raoden\|Raoden]] saved from [[Shaor\|Shaor's]] men. Asked about his profession he told Raoden that he was a jeweler, a craftsman and an artisan. Raoden assigned him to make shoes for the Elantrians which wasn't an easy task. Due to Elantrian's unhealing wounds they had to fit their bearers perfectly to avoid blistering. The lack of raw materials further complicated the task. Mareshe used leather from old book covers to make shoes.
Mareshe may have been Arelene because he thought that Raoden looked familiar.
Mareshe followed Raoden and became his friend and confidant. When [[Sarene\|Sarene]] began charity work in Elantris for her Widow's Trial, Mareshe pretended to be [[Aanden\|Aanden]].
During the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]], Derethi soldiers and Dakhor monks attacked New Elantris. When [[Galladon\|Galladon]] passes through later he spots Mareshe with an enormous, ragged hole torn in his chest, making him a [[Hoed\|Hoed]].
