The **Sho Del** are one of the three sapient species from [[Yolen\|Yolen]], the other two being humans and [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragons]]. [[Uli Da\|Uli Da]], the Vessel of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Ambition\|Ambition]], is a Sho Del. The Sho Del are not a hivemind. They fill the same niche in the [[Fain\|fain]] ecosystem as humans do in the normal one. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] has an "interesting" relationship with several Sho Del.

## Trivia
The Sho Del are one of the few elements of *Dragonsteel Prime* that are still part of the canon of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
In *Dragonsteel Prime*, the Sho Del used silver sheathes; Brandon wrote that "intentionally" and it will probably still be a thing when he writes *Dragonsteel*.
