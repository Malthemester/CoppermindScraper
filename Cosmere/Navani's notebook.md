**Navani's notebook** is a series of pages written by the [[Artifabrian\|Artifabrian]] [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]]. Navani uses her notebook as a location to write down many of her ideas in. As a result it contains information about Rosharan science.
The notes can be found as interior art in all books of *The Stormlight Archive*. While the originals were transliterated from English into the [[Women's script\|women's script]], they have been transliterated back into the English alphabet by fans.

## Pages
For a complete collection of pages from the notebook, see Category:Navani's notebook.
### Page one
The cut and type of the gem determines what kind of [[Spren\|spren]] are attracted to it and can be imprisoned in it.
There must be thousands of viable combinations.
Once a spren is captured and the gem infused with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] the [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] can be used in machines.
[[Flamespren\|Flamespren]] trapped in emerald.
(These are labels describing which spren are attracted to different gem cuts and/or types.)

cold
gravity
pain
heat
wind


### Pain Knife
The pain knife is used as a means of protection.
Sharp blades pierce an attacker’s clothing and cause crippling pain.
Remove outer covering to infuse fabrial with Stormlight
Fabrial
Retractable blades cause crippling pain.
Dial pushes blades to four set lengths.

### Page two
Examples of stormlight patterns
Patterns of stormlight filtered through the fabrial determine the power of the gem
The pattern cannot be seen by the naked eye

Fabrials allow creation of things like the emotion bracelet made of ten fabrials working together

(Examples of emotion bracelet in use)
Man betrayed by a close friend
Woman who has just been proposed to
Man who discovered his betrothed lied to him
Mother at wedding of only son

(Left)

Anticipation
anger
disgust
sadness
(Center)

love
hate
(Right)

joy
trust
fear
surprise

The trick of the emotion bracelet is first learning to read it and second learning to tell if the bracelet is reading your emotions, your subject's emotions, or the emotions of the person in the next room over

### Archery Constructions
Fabrial for an archer tower.
Glyphs of numbers; one, two, three, four (denoting the four steps during useage)
Reversal principle of conjoined
compounded custom cut amethysts.
Aids in drying bowstrings.
Idea.
Archers during the Weeping.

### Ship Designs
Too fanciful, ha?
Ask Rushu how to keep the mast from ripping off
Jasnah's favorite

### Vambrace
Touch the gems in the correct combination to
release a shock from the front nodes that will
incapacitate an attacker
Top View
Side View
Stormpiece
Timepiece

### The Fourth bridge
The fourth bridge is not as pretty as my fanciful designs
but it is thrilling to see the ship coming together
The final build follows these designs with some
changes my engineers suggested

Cutaway showing levels below main deck for carrying people and supplies

Kaladins old bridge
embedded in the deck

Possible design for next iteration of sky carriage

Main entrance works like a drawbridge

I hope fans will lessen
some of the horizontal load

Maybe add soulcast crystal
over the top

Stairs might fold up into a
table to make space

Latest tests show we need four fins instead of two wings

### The Arnist Method
The Arnist method begins with luring the
Spren to the gem

For example to attract a
Flamespren create a fire nearby

Allow the spren to
inspect the gem

Arnist hoop

Quickly
drawing out the
Stormlight
pulls the Spren
into the gem

The Spren becomes trapped inside

A
pewter
cage surrounding
the gem can be adjusted by
twisting rods hooked to eyebolts

The tighter the cage the more heat the fabrial generates

### The Crystal Pillar Room
Close up of the crystal pillar

Suppressor device

The pattern of garnets
is similar to one I
have seen on the pillar

Stairwell chamber

Library room

Murals

### Dagger
Raboniels soul
harvesting dagger

Navani: The white gold metal vein down the middle conducts investiture
Raboniel called the metal Raysium and says there is not enough in
this dagger to collect her soul or that of a herald
I am not sure I believe her

Raboniel: Navani ís right not to believe. I have given her few reasons to
trust me after all but in this thing I don't lie
why give into my enemys hands the means to destroy me?

Navani: I will proceed with my experiments
our discovery of Warlight paired with my eventual understanding
of this dagger might yield a way to stop this war

Raboniel: Though I think we disagree on what an acceptable end to the war
actually looks like

Navani: The ruby is housed in a metal other than Raysium silver maybe?

Raboniel: I can confirm the metal is not raysium, but a silver-
nickel alloy and does not affect the daggers function

Navani: Touching the dagger to
Half of the ruby does not
pull out the half spren.
Cracking one half
however allows the
Spren to escape.
The dagger immediately
pulls the spren along the
Raysium vein and into the
gem at its base

I suspect the vein of Raysium continues through the daggers
hilt and somehow attaches to the ruby at its base

Raboniel: The Raysium vein is removable, reversible and
conducts investiture directly to the gemstone


### Experiments
The Thaylen vacuum tube

A cracked diamond
affixed to the end
might give the exact
result I am seeking

The metal caps unscrew
for versatility in
experimentation

A fabrial pump removes the remaining air

Navani: The rhythms cause patterns in the sand. Different patterns for the
different kinds of light. There must be an answer of some kind here
though I wish I could consult a true scholar concerning this

Raboniel: Now that we have seen where this line of
exploration has led, I am amazed that you
were able to extrapolate this
voice of lights

Navani: The tones are
becoming easier for me to hear. I recognise the
tones of the different kinds of light and struggle to hear if there is something more.

Raboniel: Your research has yielded great fruits. There was a time I thought it impossible for one
of your kind to hear the rhythms. How could I have anticipated the magnitude of what
you have kept hidden from me? I fear I have underestimated you and your kind.
