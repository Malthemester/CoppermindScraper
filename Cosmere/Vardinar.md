**Vardinar** is a member of the [[Kholinar Wall Guard\|Kholinar Wall Guard]] in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Vardinar came to know [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] as a fellow soldier when Kaladin was investigating [[Azure\|Azure's]] activities during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]. Vardinar is not mentioned as part of [[Noro\|Noro's]] squad, but he may have been in the same platoon, since Kaladin knows him by name.
Kaladin tasked him with taking command of two squads from the Eighth Platoon to defend against the [[Fused\|Fused]] during the Battle of [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]]. Vardinar led the squads to one of the palace's towers to try and use archery against the Fused. Kaladin soon noted that the Fused must have "swept" the tower using [[Lashing\|Lashings]], as injured or dead men were falling to the wall below. It is not known if Vardinar was among the few survivors of the battle.
