>“*There had been a ... bond between him and Sureblood. More delicate and indefinable than the bond between man and sword, but still there.*”
\-Adolin[2]


**Sureblood** is [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin's]] [[Ryshadium\|Ryshadium]] stallion.

## Appearance and Personality
 by  EccoS  With [[Adolin\|Adolin]]
Sureblood is a white Ryshadium stallion with dark colored eyes; [[Shallan\|Shallan]] notes that he is actually a pure white color, not a dusty grey. He is quite tall and will tower over a gelding. He isn't as powerfully built as [[Gallant\|Gallant]], who is much bulkier and squatter than Sureblood. Unlike Gallant, he does not make mirthful clicking noises with his mouth.
Sureblood is not prone to panic, remaining calm under archery fire even when warhorses would not, and hardly needs handling by grooms. Sureblood and his master share a close bond. He is very aware of Adolin's emotions and will often prance while Adolin is riding him in an attempt to improve his rider's mood; Adolin feels like he is aware of Sureblood's emotions as well. Simply being near Sureblood is enough to make Adolin feel better, and during Sureblood's life, Adolin has felt morose to be riding a horse other than Sureblood.

## History
[[Adolin\|Adolin]] was more nervous on the day he met Sureblood than on the day he won his [[Mayalaran\|Shardblade]] because [[Ryshadium\|Ryshadium]] choose their own rider. He was young when they bonded; his exact age is not known. Sureblood and Adolin had a close bond already by 1173, when they were living in the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] and King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] wanted to go on a [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]] hunt. When the chasmfiend unexpectedly appeared on their plateau, Adolin ran for Sureblood and rode him into the conflict, cutting into the creature's legs as he rode by. Adolin also rode Sureblood out to skirmishes with the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] on the Shattered Plains as the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] attempted to win [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]], although he typically led the charge on foot so he could leap the chasms.

 by  EccoS  At the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]
Sureblood carried Adolin to the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], where [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] abandoned the Kholin army to die. Although the close-quartered fighting wasn't conducive to mounted attacks, Sureblood served usefully as a ride for a few of the wounded until [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] gave them an avenue of retreat; on the way back to the warcamps, he carried Adolin once more.
Adolin continued to ride Sureblood, though he had less opportunity to ride or to groom the Ryshadium in the stable in the evenings as he was wont to do the more [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] focused on uniting the [[Highprince\|highprinces]] instead of riding out to capture gemhearts. He took Sureblood out to a skirmish that only [[Roion\|Roion]] and [[Ruthar\|Ruthar]] were scheduled to go on in order to lend [[Jakamav\|Jakamav]], the only other [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]], a hand. When Adolin left his conversation with Jakamav stewing, Sureblood attempted to ease his mood.
Sureblood also took Adolin on the expedition to [[Narak\|Narak]] despite [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] envy over Adolin having the taller mount. As the fighting commenced, Sureblood was unsettled by the song the Parshendi were singing to summon the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. He charged into [[Battle of Narak\|battle]] with Adolin, but a flash of red lightning struck him, killing him and flinging Adolin off of his back. When Adolin came across Sureblood's body, he screamed in grief.
Adolin, realizing he had taken Sureblood for granted toward the end of his life, began visiting [[Gallant\|Gallant]] in the stables. This budding relationship in the wake of Sureblood's demise eventually led to Gallant's loyal help in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] on the trip to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]].
