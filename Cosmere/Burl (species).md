>“*I did get several other Superiority races—like the burl, who are citizens but considered aggressive—to join this test.*”

The **burl** are an alien species within the [[Superiority\|Superiority]].
They are larger than most other races and resemble gorillas, although it seems they walk upright as default. While a member of the Superiority, the burl are considered too aggressive to attain primary citizenship. Nonetheless, some of them can be found living on [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]], and a few participate in the [[Delver\|Delver]] Resistance Program. Like most so-called lesser species, they are wary of Superiority leaders, and are treated as disposable by them in turn.
