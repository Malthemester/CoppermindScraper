**Ettmetal**, also known as harmonium, is the [[God Metal\|God Metal]] of [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. It is used in some of the [[Southern Scadrial\|Southern Scadrians']] [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] technologies.

## Properties
Harmonium is the condensed elemental form of [[Harmony\|Harmony's]] power. Alloying [[Atium\|atium]] and [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] will not give harmonium. While difficult, it is possible to obtain atium and lerasium from ettmetal, but not through mechanical means.

### Chemical Properties
Due to the merging of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] [[Shard\|intents]] into Harmony, ettmetal's [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual aspect]] is in opposition with itself, leading to effects on the metal's [[Physical Realm\|Physical aspect]], which makes it extremely reactive. It reacts violently with water, similar to . After reacting with water, residual ettmetal hydroxide is left behind, though the substance's properties are unknown. The [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] use ettmetal to create powerful bombs, which the [[Set\|Set]] have been trying to replicate with limited success.

## Metallic Arts
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]]
The [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]], [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]], and [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] properties of ettmetal are unknown. Because of its volatile nature near water, ingesting ettmetal is likely to be fatal for Allomancers, though a full [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], with access to [[Gold\|gold]] [[Compounding\|Compounding]], could burn it for some effect. Hemalurgic spikes would also likely be difficult to create, due to the metal's reactivity, however, it is not impossible.

### Mechanical Uses
In conjunction with Southern [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] technology, ettmetal can reproduce Allomantic or Feruchemical powers within its vicinity. The Southern Scadrians have also used the metal in **primer cubes** which can somehow regulate ettmetal's effects with the flip of a switch. When used Allomantically, the metal is said to burn "with a pure whiteness" and will slowly be consumed, in the same way it would be by a Misting or Mistborn. It is used to fuel Southern Scadrian Allomantic technology, including their airships that run via [[Steel\|steelpushing]].

## Trivia
The term "harmonium" has never been used in the stories published so far, but Brandon Sanderson introduced the term in one of his talks even before the release of [[Shadows of Self\|Shadows of Self]] and has afterwards confirmed that it is another term for ettmetal. [[Marasi\|Marasi]] probably did not know the term harmonium when [[Allik\|Allik]] described ettmetal to her, as otherwise the word would have translated.
If harmonium followed the naming conventions of the other God Metals it would have been named *Sazedium*. However, [[Sazed\|Sazed]] didn't like the sound of it.
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] has described harmonium as "super-cesium" in reference to its violent chemical reaction with water. , like other real-life , is extremely reactive and will cause an explosion with water even at sub-zero temperatures. He later clarified that cesium was not intended as a direct analogue; ettmetal would theoretically be classified as an alkali metal, although it has a different melting point.
The Mistborn Metal Dice Set from Crafty Games lists a non-canonical description of harmonium's properties, stating "Unknown in the Classic Era, Harmonium replicates the effects of nearby Allomantic or Feruchemical metals." It also lists harmonium as an Internal and Pushing God Metal.
