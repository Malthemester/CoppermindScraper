**Tlik** is a guard at the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]] in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Tlik seemed friendly with [[Rysn\|Rysn]], presumably since she entered the vault often to perform accounting work. He chuckled when he saw that [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri]] had sneaked into the vault, and joked that the many spheres in the vault must seem like a buffet to a [[Larkin\|larkin]].

## History
Tlik was stationed inside the Reserve's [[Sphere\|Sphere]] Vault on the day of the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. He guarded the inner door, and was armed with a crossbow to prevent entry. He allowed Rysn and [[Vstim\|Vstim]] to enter using a passcode, accompanied by a member of the Queen's Guard.
He followed them in and helped transfer Rysn from her wheelchair to a smaller palanquin-style chair, which he and the queen's guard carried deeper into the vault. After Vstim opened a vault containing the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]], the queen's guard suddenly killed Tlik in cold blood by stabbing him in the neck before taking the gemstone. Another guard, [[Fladm\|Fladm]], attempted to shoot the thief, who returned fire with Tlik's crossbow. Tlik's murderer was revealed to be one of the [[Fused\|Fused]] using an illusory technique that was likely similar to Lightweaving.
