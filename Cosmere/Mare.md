## Appearance and Personality
 by  Shuravf 
For more images, see [[Mare/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Mare has dark hair and a stubborn personality. Kelsier describes her as having had 'a hidden streak of unconventionality'.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Allomancy
Mare is a [[Tineye\|tineye]], meaning she can burn tin to enhance her senses.

### Thieving
Mare is a competent thief, working with Kelsier and Dockson as well as other thieves. She is also very skilled at impersonating a noblewoman.

## History
Mare was drawn to the Skaa underground because of both her status as a skaa [[Misting\|Misting]] and her interest in pre-Ascension times. This was how she met Kelsier. They got married, although [[Marsh\|Marsh]] had also been in love with her. Mare was also friends with [[Sazed\|Sazed]], and introduced him to her husband.

She wanted children, particularly a daughter whom she could teach to ‚Äòwalk the line between noblewoman and thief‚Äô. However, Kelsier thought they would be a hindrance and so they had none ‚Äî something he later regretted.
She expressed disappointment when Kelsier's vigilante actions against nobles would throw their life into upheaval.
When Kelsier heard that the Lord Ruler was hiding something valuable in his secret room, Mare and a [[Smoker\|Smoker]] named [[Redd\|Redd]] helped him in his attempt to break into the room. However, they arrived to find [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] outside the secret chamber, waiting for them. They killed Redd immediately.. The Lord Ruler then thanked Mare for betraying Kelsier to him, before the two were separated.
She arrived in the Pits of Hathsin a few weeks after Kelsier. Though he still loved her, Kelsier questioned her loyalty due to the Lord Ruler's words. She died eighteen months later, having sacrificed herself for Kelsier. He had been unable to find an [[Atium\|atium]] geode, without which he would have been killed by the taskmasters. Mare convinced him to take hers, lying that she had found two that week. When it was revealed that she had none, the taskmasters beat her to death. This event is what caused Kelsier to [[Snap\|Snap]].
It was generally believed that Mare was the one who betrayed Kelsier, until [[Vin\|Vin]] realized that the Lord Ruler and his Inquisitors were able to pierce copperclouds. She and Kelsier concluded that they sensed Mare‚Äôs use of allomancy on that night. This was how they were caught, proving that Mare hadn't betrayed Kelsier after all.

## Trivia
Kelsier asks [[Preservation\|Preservation]] if she went to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]] and the god seems unable to reply. There is no [[Cognitive shadow\|cognitive shadow]] of Mare hanging around.
