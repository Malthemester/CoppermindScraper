The **Threnodite system** is the planetary system that contains [[Threnody\|Threnody]], where [[Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell\|Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell]] takes place. Though none of the planets in the system have [[Shard\|Shards]] residing on them, the Shards [[Ambition\|Ambition]], [[Mercy\|Mercy]], and [[Odium\|Odium]] fought in the empty space of the system. It is unclear which side Mercy supported, though it seems likely that they were allied to Ambition, since [[Harmony\|Harmony]] reached out to them for help against Odium. Ambition was mortally wounded as a result of this clash, and this calamity is at least a partial cause of the twisted forms of Investiture on Threnody. The system contains four planets, one of which has a moon. It is significant that most of the celestial bodies in the system are named after songs of mourning.

## Planets
There are four planets in this system. Three of the four planets, as well as the sole moon, are named after different types of songs of mourning:


The planet closest to the sun.


This is the second planet from the sun, possessing a moon called **Coronach**.


The third planet from the sun, where [[Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell\|Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell]] takes place. This planet has people on it, as well as a strong ambient Investiture presence in the form of the shades that populate the Forests found on one of the two continents. Threnody has no moon.


This planet is the furthest out in the system, and is much farther from the other three planets than they are from each other. It is also much larger than the other three planets, which are similar in size to each other. The exclamation "Purity's Eye," used by [[Nazh\|Nazh]], likely derives from this planet.
