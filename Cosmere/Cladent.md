## Appearance and Personality
Clubs is described as having a gnarled face with an unhappy expression, similar to a piece of knotted wood. Although he appears to be much older than [[Breeze\|Breeze]], he still seems to be physically fit. He usually displays a grim and pessimistic demeanor, regarding those around him with disapproval. He walks with a limp due to a past injury that he got in battle, and has a large scar from it.

## Attributes and Abilities
 by  Katie Payne  With [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and the other members of his [[Kelsier's crew\|crew]]
Clubs is a Smoker. Burning copper allows him to form an invisible "coppercloud" around him that blocks the bronze senses of [[Seeker\|Seekers]] and [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], allowing people nearby to use Allomancy without being discovered. It also makes him immune to emotional Allomancy while burning copper.

## History
Before joining [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] Clubs was a soldier in the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]‚Äôs army with some command. He was a [[Smoker\|Smoker]]. He was also a successful carpenter and employed several apprentices, some of whom were also Smokers.At some point in the past he 'adopted' his nephew [[Spook\|Spook]] after his parents discovered he was a [[Misting\|Misting]] and abandoned him. Kelsier's crew used Club's shop as a secret base of operations in Luthadel. Like most Smokers, he was tasked with maintaining a [[Coppercloud\|coppercloud]] around his shop to protect those inside from prying [[Seeker\|Seekers]]. After the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] was defeated, Elend appointed Clubs as the general of his armies.
He disliked Captain [[Demoux\|Demoux]] preaching the [[Church of the Survivor\|Church of the Survivor]] to his troops.
Clubs came to befriend Breeze. The two often spent time in the evenings conversing and drinking at Keep Venture.
Before the [[Battle of Luthadel\|Battle of Luthadel]], [[Sazed\|Sazed]] tried to teach him about the religion of [[Dadradah\|Dadradah]], which focuses on art and craftsmanship. Sazed remarked that the care that Clubs devoted to his carpentry showed his true passion to be art, not warfare. As a token of the Dadradah faith, he also gives Clubs a small wooden disk carved with the image of a brush.
He died during the Battle of Luthadel, killed by a [[Koloss\|koloss]] while saving Breeze. Later on, Sazed found the wooden disk that he gave Clubs tied to the man's corpse.
