>“*I'm Preservation. The knife ... I haven’t actually drawn it in millennia. You speak of acting like [Ruin], as he pretended I would act! It’s horrible!*”
\-Leras to Kelsier[1]


**Leras's knife** is a knife of unknown origin that belongs to [[Leras\|Leras]]. Its handle is made of bone.
Leras refers to the knife as an "old friend," and hasn't drawn it in millennia, which may suggest it is from [[Yolen\|Yolen]] and predates the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]].
When [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] arrived at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] suggested that Leras stab Elend with the knife to try to encourage Vin to use the power of the Well to heal Elend rather than accidentally release it to [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. When, as a result of [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] influence on his mind, Leras proved unable to do so, Kelsier grabed his arm and slashed the knife across Elend's stomach. Despite his inability to use the weapon, Leras still reached for it when Kelsier made a fist at him. Leras does not need to actually draw the knife; he instead reaches for it on his belt, after which his hand shimmers and then the knife appears.
It is unclear what happened to the knife after Leras's death. His body appeared in the ash outside [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]]; it is possible the knife was with that corpse. If that is the case, it may well be gone, as [[Sazed\|Sazed]] did not do anything with the bodies of [[Ati\|Ati]] and Leras during [[Final Ascension\|his Ascension]].

## Trivia
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon]] has [[RAFO\|RAFO'd]] whether or not waving the knife over a candle would cause the candle to light, and whether or not the knife is a kind of [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
