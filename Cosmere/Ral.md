>“* Master Ral likes things you can use. Things to sit on, things to put clothes in. But I think I can make a good chair tomorrow, something that will make him proud.*”
\- Tien[1]


**Ral** is a [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] carpenter from [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. He has a shop in the town and employs several apprentices.

## History
Ral learned carpentry from his father, whom he succeeded as the town's carpenter in 1166. He eventually hired two apprentices, and in the second year of citylord [[Roshone\|Roshone's]] governance, Ral hired [[Tien\|Tien]] as well--likely in an act of aid to [[Lirin\|Lirin's]] family, as Ral had little need of additional help. Later that year, he expressed disappointment in Tien's poor productivity, as the young boy would often get distracted with projects which did not prove useful or profitable.
