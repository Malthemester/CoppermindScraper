**Nu Ralik** is a deity secretly worshiped by the people of the [[Purelake\|Purelake]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Beliefs
[[Rysn\|Rysn]] notes that every Purelaker she has met cares deeply about their gods. The Purelakers believe that Nu Ralik has a great deal of influence on their lives. [[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] believes that Nu Ralik is responsible for both the quality of his daily fishing catch and [[Maib\|Maib's]] recent finger aches. Ishikk also believes that Nu Ralik holds sway over his destiny, and he often mentally appeals to Nu Ralik regarding potential events in his future.

>“*... Nu Ralik knew that the boundaries of nature were far more important than the boundaries of nations. Ishikk was a Purelaker. First and foremost. By tide and sun he was.*”
\-Ishikk[1]


Nu Ralik has an indeterminate association with the natural world. Ishikk has little regard for kingdoms or borders, believing that Nu Ralik places precedence on natural boundaries.
Purelakers also have a strong penchant for being in the sunlight and keeping their feet in the water to feel the tides; Ishikk thinks "Nu Ralik forbid!" in regards to wearing a shirt.

## Secrecy
Although Nu Ralik is the true god of the Purelakers, in public they always swear by [[Vun Makak\|Vun Makak]], Nu Ralik's jealous and spiteful younger brother. They believe that they must trick Vun Makak into believing that they worship him instead. They do not speak Nu Ralik's name outside of their [[Holy grotto\|holy grottos]], although in one instance a Purelaker invokes Nu Ralik's name when he is about to die.

>“* Oh, Nu Ralik ... We shouldn't have killed the guard. I just wanted ... wanted to see the sun again ...*”
\- A Purelaker convict paralysed by Szeth[3]


Despite the efforts of the Purelakers, their worship of Nu Ralik is not completely secret, as both [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] and the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]] are aware that he is their true god.
