## Setting
The entire State is set in perpetual night and it often raining, though the natural weather is never more intense than a drizzle. The exception to this is when someone hacks the programming and makes use of something that does not belong in the State, at which point the weather increases in intensity. The State is described as being based on western cultures of early twentieth century Earth.

## Technology
Much of the technology is from the early twentieth century. Maltese has trains, cars, handguns, and skyscrapers. The State does allow some technology from other eras, with [[Liveborn\|Liveborn]] capable of keeping any of their personal [[Boosts\|Boosts]], as well as wrist phones.

## Politics
Maltese, being a Communal State, has no native Liveborn. As such, Liveborn can compete with one another for the local [[Machineborn\|Machineborns']] favor, elections being held once every two years. The Liveborn have turned this into somewhat of a game, taking advantage of the non-lethal nature of the handguns as well so that anytime a Liveborn is hit by one of the pellets that the handguns fire, the Machineborn in Maltese cannot see them for two weeks. This "penalty" is detrimental when campaigning for Machineborn favor. Those Liveborn that visit but don't participate are considered *wildcards*.
