## Appearance & Personality
Ico has metallic bronze skin and looks human. He is shorter than an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] and sturdily built. He wears tan-colored human clothing that has many buttoned pockets.
Ico is a spren of very few words; he is very brusque and speaks his mind. He is kind enough to give [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]], [[Pattern\|Pattern]], [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] and [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]] passage to [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] and is helpful in explaining some things to his human passengers, such as the currency in Shadesmar, how [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] works in Shadesmar, and [[Deadeye\|deadeye]] spren. He gets exasperated at times but he is understanding and practical. He believes humans cannot be trusted with Oaths and says as much, but grows embarrassed when he realizes that this was rude.

## History
Ico was very old by human standards, old enough that his father died during the [[Recreance\|Recreance]].
Captain Ico picked up the Radiants and their team from the lighthouse, giving them passage to Celebrant. He gave [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] a device that contained a soul of ice so that there will be water for the humans to drink, a [[Hydrator\|hydrator]]. He gave [[Adolin\|Adolin]] clothing to wear and remarked that he looks like a [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] going to a [[Feast of Light\|Feast of Light]]. He refused to take them to [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] because ships that travel there had not returned lately. Before they parted ways he told the team that they should stay in Shadesmar as the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] was not a pleasant place at the moment. 
During the scheduled inspection of his ship in Celebrant, Captain Ico was questioned by one of the [[Fused\|Fused]]. While it was not known what has been said, the Fused accidentally set Ico's ship on fire when he was trying to scare him into giving information on the humans.

## Family
Ico has a father who is a deadeye. He keeps him locked in a room in the cargo hold to keep him from wandering the decks and falling overboard in search of the human carrying his corpse.
Ico also had a daughter who used to work at a currency exchange in Celebrant. He said she ran off chasing stupid dreams. This may be [[Timbre\|Timbre]].
