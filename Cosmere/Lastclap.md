The **lastclap** is a combat maneuver used on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] to "catch" an opponent's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] between the palms. It is used as a last resort by someone unarmored and unarmed when they have no other options. The lastclap can only be performed when the Shardbearer attacks with an overhead swing.

### Dalinar Kholin
During an assassination attempt by [[Szeth\|Szeth]] in [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] palace on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], Dalinar became trapped with no weapons or armor. Szeth attempted to strike an overhead killing blow with his [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], but Dalinar brought the palms of his hands together as the blade fell and caught it. This surprised Szeth and allowed [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to tackle him. Dalinar likely succeeded at catching the blade only because of his exceptional physical prowess.

### Zahel
>“* Old Dalinar pulled off a lastclap, eh? Good for him.*”
\- Zahel to Kaladin[4]


Kaladin later asked for [[Zahel\|Zahel's]] help in fighting a Shardbearer and mentioned that Dalinar was able to catch Szeth's blade. Zahel was familiar with the technique and used the term "lastclap"; he told Kaladin that it was a "stupid maneuver" that only worked when Shardbearers swung straight down with a relatively slow strike. He also said that it usually failed, and then "you're dead." Zahel urged Kaladin to focus on other strategies that worked more often, and Kaladin agreed.

### Kaladin
Although Kaladin did not train in the use of the lastclap, he was forced to use it at the end of the disadvantaged duel between [[Relis Ruthar\|Relis Ruthar]] and [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]]. Relis moved to attack [[Renarin\|Renarin]] but hesitated, instead swinging at Kaladin, who caught his Blade. This caused Kaladin and Relis to hear the [[Deadeye\|deadeye]] spren of the Blade screaming in their minds; Relis fled the arena in terror, forfeiting the duel.

## Trivia
The artwork at the top left of the [[Alethi Codes of War\|Alethi Codes of War]] appears to depict someone performing a lastclap, although the aggressor is wielding a normal sword and not a Shardblade.
