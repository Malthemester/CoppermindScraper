**Larmic mucus** is a substance with antiseptic properties on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is less expensive than [[Lister's oil\|lister's oil]] or [[Knobweed\|knobweed]] sap, but also less effective. It has a foul smell.
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] tried to acquire antiseptics for [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], the apothecary suggested larmic mucus instead of the more powerful (and more expensive) antiseptics, but a small jar of mucus still cost ten days pay for a [[Bridgeman\|bridgeman]]. Seeing the high cost of antiseptics inspired Kaladin's plan to harvest knobweed sap so that he could use some of it and sell the surplus.
