**Chubs** is a very fat [[Taynix\|taynix]] that [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] discovers in a cavern along with several other taynix. He is one of the yellow and blue variety of taynix, allowing him to teleport with his cytonic abilities. When Jorgen, [[Freyja\|FM]], and [[Rodge McCaffery\|Rig]] are first watching over the new taynix, Chubs and [[Happy\|Happy]] get into a crate of mushrooms and begin eating. FM discovers them in the crate, and gives Chubs his name.
Chubs loves caviar like most taynix, and FM uses it to try and train him. She teaches him to teleport to a specific box with food in it, as part of her, Rig’s, and Jorgen’s experiments with the taynix.
