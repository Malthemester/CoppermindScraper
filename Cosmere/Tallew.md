**Tallew** is a type of grain native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Cultivation
Tallew is a relatively labor-intensive crop to grow, as it cannot survive flooding from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. This makes it profitable to sell, which led [[Turinad Sebarial\|Turinad Sebarial]] to set up tallew fields near the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. The [[Akanny\|Akanny]] region of the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]] in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] has rolling hills that are ideal for growing [[Lavis\|lavis]] and tallew, and it produces a large amount of both grains.
Once harvested, tallew can be stored for months to provide sustenance during the winter. It can be transported in bags and used as rations on long journeys. Tallew's long shelf life allowed the [[Kholinar Wall Guard\|Kholinar Wall Guard]] to eat it during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]].

## Culinary Uses
Tallew is similar to rice and it can be prepared in several ways, including steaming and boiling. It is a simple meal often eaten by soldiers, slaves, and [[Ardent\|ardents]].
The grain often has other ingredients such as spices added to it. [[Lighteyes\|Lighteyes]] sometimes eat boiled tallew mixed with a spicy gravy spread on slices of [[Stagm\|stagm]]. Fruited tallew rice with flatbread is a common meal for children in Alethkar. Tallew is often used as an ingredient in stew. [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv]] served his slaves unspiced, overcooked tallew with a mushy texture and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] found it revolting, later experiencing flashbacks to how bad it tasted.
Tallew can be used to make flatbread. It can also be fermented to make brandy or [[Veden saph\|Veden saph]].
