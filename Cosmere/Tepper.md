**Tepper** is a [[Skaa\|skaa]] elder from the [[Tresting plantation\|Tresting plantation]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is scrawny, and appears to be in his early forties. He has a stern, humorless personality. Like most skaa, he lives in fear of the [[Mist\|mists]], the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], [[Koloss\|koloss]], and his master.

## History
Tepper led a group of about thirty skaa that worked for Lord [[Themos Tresting\|Themos Tresting]] and lived in hovels on his plantation. Tepper was young for an elder, and [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] deduced that [[Mennis\|Mennis]] let him lead even though Mennis had seniority. Mennis implied that he did not have the energy to rein in Tepper's desire to be charge.
Tepper kept a close eye on travelling skaa so that they did not upset his masters. He recognized Kelsier as the Survivor, and called him a troublemaker. Tepper had the typical mindset of a skaa during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]—he mostly just wanted to avoid beatings—and was easily shocked by Kelsier's actions and attitude.
After Lord Tresting ordered [[Jess\|Jess's]] young daughter to be taken from her home to have sex with him (which would also be a death sentence, due to the ban on skaa-noble children), Kelsier went to the mansion, killed everyone inside, and burned it down. Mennis realized that Kelsier did this in order to force Tepper and his group into action, since the Lord Ruler would likely come to the plantation seeking vengeance. Tepper was stunned by this turn of events, but eventually helped Mennis gather the plantation skaa to prepare for a journey to find other rebels in the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]].
