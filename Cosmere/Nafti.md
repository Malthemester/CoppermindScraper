## Appearance and Personality
The Uvara are noted as having "long, limber bodies". They wear shells in their hair that are not found elsewhere on Roshar, and monochrome robes.

## History
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] relates the story of a ship named the *Wandersail*, captained by King [[Derethil\|Derethil]], to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. The ship attempts to sail through a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] on the open seas and is wrecked on the uncharted islands of the Uvara. The Uvara initially seem like a peaceful people, but Derethil soon realizes that they violently kill each other if they make any kind of mistake, in fear of displeasing their emperor.
Derethil and his crew discover that the emperor has actually been dead for years, throwing the Uvara into chaos and rioting. Nafti, who had been serving as a guide to Derethil's crew, leaves the islands on the *Wandersail*. She explains that the reason the Uvara were in such anguish was that they had realized that they alone were responsible for all the death and violence.

## Historicity
The tale of the *Wandersail* is known in several nations of Roshar, but some regard it only as a myth. Hoid answers cryptically when Kaladin questions the story's authenticity. At the same time, there may be elements of truth to the story.
