## Geography
It is located in the northwestern corner of Alethkar, bordered to the west by [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and the north by the [[Bay of Elibath\|Bay of Elibath]]. [[Aladar princedom\|Aladar princedom]] on the east, and [[Vamah princedom\|Vamah princedom]] to the south. The town of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] is located in eastern Sadeas, near the border with Aladar.

## Highprince
After the murder of Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], the rulership of the Sadeas princedom was given to [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]] by [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]], as her nephew - the heir - was too young. After Amaram's death, [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] was the de facto head of the princedom, though the princedom itself is under the control of the [[Fused\|Fused]]. After Ialai's death in early 1175, Queen [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] appointed a distant scion of Torol Sadeas as the new highprince.

## History
Like all Alethi princedoms, Sadeas is a piece of [[Sunmaker\|Sunmaker]]-era Alethkar carved out by one of Sadees' sons. When Gavilar Kholin begun his conquest of Alethark in the 1130s, Sadeas princedom, under the leadership of Torol Sadeas, was the only one to initially ally with him.
Following the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], the princedom was, like all others, overrun by re-awakened [[Parshmen\|Parshmen]]. However, it appears to have weathered this relatively unscathed compared to other princedoms like [[Vamah princedom\|Vamah]] or [[Kholin princedom\|Kholin]].
