## History
After being taken by the [[Reod\|Reod]], Matisse is taken to [[Karata\|Karata's]] palace by [[Dashe\|Dashe]]. Once there she is tasked with looking after the children. Once [[Raoden\|Raoden]] founds [[New Elantris\|New Elantris]] and befriends Karata, Matisse is given official charge of the [[Roost\|Roost]], New Elantris' nursery.
During the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]] she leads the children away from New Elantris and towards the Library, then she distracts the soldiers which pursue her by drawing Aon Ashe to entice them and then blind them. She runs away from the temporarily blinded soldiers but is trapped, though Dashe also runs in to her and fends off the soldiers for a short time before being impaled on one of their swords.
After the healing of Elantris, she is recaptured by the soldiers until Dashe kills them with the sword he was impaled upon.

## Appearance
She has a cut on her cheek which she sustained shortly after the Reod took her. After [[Raoden\|Raoden]] adds the Chasm Line to Elantris' foundation Aon, the cut is healed along with the rest of her wounds.

## Trivia
