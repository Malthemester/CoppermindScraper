**Platform Prime** is the orbital headquarters of the [[DDF\|DDF]] and is located within the protective shell around [[Detritus\|Detritus]]. It is "enormous" and has an artificial gravity field. It is one of thousands of [[Platform\|platforms]] surrounding the planet. It is the largest platform that has been recaptured by the DDF and is in near-perfect working order despite being abandoned for decades.
At the time of [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] jump to Starsight, the DDF had begun to unearth the contents of its databanks, the first one being a disturbing record of humankind's disastrous attempts to summon a [[Delver\|delver]].
