>“*I saw men who placed themselves above others, and I saw them cast down.*”
\-Vivenna quoting one of the Five Visions[1]

\-Vivenna quoting one of the Five Visions[2]


**The Five Visions** were a teaching in [[Austrism\|Austrism]]. They were guidelines spoken by the First [[Returned\|Returned]] [[Vo\|Vo]], as a message from Austre.
They taught the believers of Austre to be patient, humble, sacrificing, selfless, and understanding and to not be ostentatious, selfish or place themselves above others.
One of the teaching was to try and understand other and not place yourself above them.
To set an example in following the Five Visions, every noble or rich family was obligated by tradition to provide one person to the monasteries. 

## History
[[Vo\|Vo]], the first Returned, was born aboard a ship sailing to the coast. He declared the five Visions and died the next week, according to [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
