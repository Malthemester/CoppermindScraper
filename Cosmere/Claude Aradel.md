## History
Aradel was a constable in Elendel.

After the resignation of Constable-General [[Brettin\|Brettin]], Aradel came out of retirement to accept the position. He hired [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] as a constable. She served him as an assistant and crime analyst.
He headed the investigation into the massacre at [[Winsting Innate's auction\|Winsting Innate's auction]]. He brought [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] into the investigation. The kandra [[Paalm\|Paalm]] was developed as a suspect. The actions of Paalm put Elendel into a state of near-revolution. To quell riots [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate]] issued an executive order declaring a state of martial law and naming Aradel Lord High Constable. After the discovery that Innate had been replaced by Paalm, Marasi arranged to have [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] replace Innate for the purpose of quelling the crowd. When MeLaan began to fail, Aradel placed the Innate imposter under arrest for corruption. He quelled the crowd by promising to arrest other corrupt nobles.
After the downfall and death of Innate, Aradel became governor. He is the first non-noble leader since before the time of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]].

## Trivia
