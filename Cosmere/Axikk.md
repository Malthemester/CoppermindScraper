**Axikk** is a vizier in the [[Azish\|Azish]] government on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Axikk was presumably a high-ranking vizier based on his candidacy for Prime and his presence in the emperor's quarters with other important viziers such as Dalksi and [[Noura\|Noura]].

## History
Axikk was one of the potential [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] candidates during the Azish succession crisis following the assassination of two Primes in one week by [[Szeth\|Szeth]]. [[Lift\|Lift]] overheard him in the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] talking to a number of other viziers. Like the other candidates, Axikk intentionally wrote a bad application essay in an attempt to avoid elevation to Prime. Additionally, he claimed to be disqualified due to a bad back. This excuse was refuted by [[Dalksi\|Dalksi]], who pointed out that [[Ashno\|Ashno of Sages]] had a bad back, but was considered one of the greatest [[Emuli\|Emuli]] Primes.
He is implied to be one of the viziers who attempts to teach Lift during her time in the Bronze Palace after the ascension of [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]]; Lift mentions a vizier that she refers to as "Big A" because of the choking sounds in his name. He was likely one of the many viziers present during [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] diplomatic visit to Azimir.
