*A Hero for All Ages* is a historical operetta in post-[[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], written by [[Sablerfils\|Sablerfils]] and [[Buissonommes\|Buissonommes]].
A performance at [[Clarvonne's Theater\|Clarvonne's Theater]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] was advertised in *The House Record* on the 1st of Doxil, 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. The title is a play on the term "[[Hero of Ages\|Hero of Ages]]", and the operetta presumably tells the story of [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend\|Elend]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. The advertisement appears to depict the couple reaching toward each other while wearing [[Mistcloak\|mistcloaks]]. Vin is held back by a group of [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] and Elend by a group of [[Skaa\|skaa]].
