\-Muri to Shallan after Grund's death[1]


**Muri** is a [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] seamstress of the second [[Nahn\|nahn]] in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], she fled the occupation of [[Revolar\|Revolar]] to Kholinar, losing her successful seamstressing business and moving into a hovel. She has three daughters and struggled to feed them during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], resorting to search water ditches for dead rats and cremlings for food. She is usually regarded as "nice" and "pleasant," and generally had amusing gossip.
When [[Shallan Davar\|Veil]] asks [[Grund\|Grund]] about people who might need food, Muri is the first person he lists. Veil proceeds to donate some food to Muri and several other beggars and refugees. However, a gang known as the [[Grips\|Grips]] terrorizes anyone who receives donations, ultimately killing Grund. Muri always had to wait for Veil for her food. Muri's handler from the Grips had an argument with another man, and Muri overheard her name so was hurriedly packing her and her family's bags to flee. Muri angrily chides Veil, telling Veil that she should have died instead of Grund, then leaves.
Veil suffers a mental crisis after learning that her poor judgment lead to suffering and death, and is consoled by [[Wit\|Wit]].
