**Tobias** is a member of [[Red Young\|Red Young's]] team of bounty hunters from the [[Fortress Town\|Fortress Towns]] of Threnody.

## History
Red took a search party of fortfolk to the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] hunting for [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]], hoping to collect the bounty on his head. Red mentioned that Tobias had gone out scouting ahead of the group and had discovered that [[Silence\|Silence]] and [[William Ann Montane\|William Ann Montane]] had already killed Chesterton. Tobias was presumably present when the gang found Silence and took Chesterton's body; all of the fortfolk later fell victim to a booby trap placed by Silence and were killed by [[Shade\|shades]].
