\-Jasnah on being a Veristitalian[1]


The **Veristitalians** are an order of scholars on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Veristitalians wish to create unbiased, factual accounts of the past in order to understand the present and be prepared for the future. In their opinion most historians don't write about the events but try to show the most adulating picture of themselves and their motives. Each one chooses a project they feel is misrepresented or misunderstood to study.
[[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], [[Ethid\|Ethid]], and [[Jochi\|Jochi]] are Veristitalians.
