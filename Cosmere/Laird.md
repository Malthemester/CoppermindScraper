Prelan **Laird** was an [[Obligator\|obligator]] of the [[Canton\|Canton of Finance]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the times of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].

## Appearance and Personality
Like all obligators Laird is bald and wears a dark gray robe, but the complex tattoos around his eyes mark him as more than an ordinary obligator, namely a prelan. Laird has a lordly air, he doesn't bother to bow back to lesser noblemen or to dismiss servants.

## History
He visited [[Camon\|Camon]] to arrange a transportation deal. Camon, who acted as 'Lord Jedue', tried to swindle the prelan by setting up a contract he wouldn't live up to. Laird was suspicious of Camon's too good to be true offer, but after repeated Soothings by [[Vin\|Vin]] he said that he was willing to propose Camon's adjusted offer to the council again.
It is likely that Laird felt Vin's Soothings, as obligators are trained to recognize this, and Camon's follow-up appointment with the ministry was planned with High Prelan [[Arriev\|Arriev]] who was better suited to decide if either Vin or Camon was an [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]].
