## Appearance and Personality
Not much is known about Reen's appearance, however; Reen is a brutal individual, who often beats Vin for little or no reason, though he claims it is to toughen her up. He trusts no one, and is not hesitant about drilling this idea into [[Vin\|Vin]] as well. Though Reen is frequently violent and harsh toward Vin, he does care, as he saved her from their mother, and protected her from being found by the Obligators.

## History
He was half brother to [[Vin\|Vin]] and looked after her in their childhood. He raised Vin to be wary of everything and trust no one, including himself, always claiming that he would betray her in the end. Later, he was captured by the [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitors]], but he never revealed Vin's existence; despite being tortured day and night, he insisted that she had starved to death years ago.
Reen and Vin originally lived with their mother, who was the parent they both shared. After the death of Vin's sister by her mother's hands, Reen left with Vin to earn a living in the skaa underground. The pair traveled with different crews around various towns and cities in the central dominance. When Reen left Vin, they were serving in [[Camon\|Camon's]] crew in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. Camon claimed that Reen owed him a large sum of money, though the reason behind this is unknown.
Throughout her life Vin was plagued by Reen's voice, which advised her against trusting in anyone. Although many times, she simply would remember Reen's constant warning about trusting others. During the [[Siege of Fadrex City\|Siege of Fadrex City]], Vin discovers, through a conversation with the Shard himself, that [[Ruin\|Ruin]] was responsible for the frequent "whispers" in her head from Reen's voice. Ruin accomplished this by speaking to her via her [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgically]] charged [[Vin's earring\|earring]].
