**Milev** was a dark skinned skaa from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
He acted as [[Camon\|Camon's]] second in command in the thief crew and was given leadership of the crew by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]].
When giving command of the crew to Milev, Kelsier demands Camon be made a beggar. Vin assumes Milev will simply have Camon killed, but it is later proven that Milev's fear and/or awe of Kelsier was enough for him to follow through in his promise.
Milev was slowly tortured to death by [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] for information on [[Vin\|Vin's]] whereabouts. They tied him to a chair and gouged out his eyes while questioning him.
