\-Hoid to Dalinar[1]


**Hoid** is a recurring character in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], originally from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. Hoid is not his original name; before telling [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] the story of the *Wandersail*, he claims he stole the name from someone he should have loved. The [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragon]] [[Frost\|Frost]] once asked him in a letter if he is no longer hiding behind the name of his old master, likely referring to the name Hoid. Among the original [[Vessel\|Vessels]], Hoid is often known as Cephandrius, which is one of his earliest aliases.
Hoid was involved in the events taking place before any of the cosmere's published books begin, and is the second oldest character seen so far. He was originally human, but has changed enough that when asked, [[Brandon\|Brandon]] only says "It's complicated." Hoid is not a [[Shard\|Shard]], nor is he a [[Herald\|Herald]], but something else entirely. He is very skilled with disguises, and the overtness of his involvement varies from book to book. In some, he is named outright and makes references to other events and places in the cosmere, while in others he is seen only deep in disguise, almost unrecognizable. Brandon has confirmed that all of these appearances are the same individual, but that he [[Worldhopping\|worldhops]] between planets. Hoid's motives are unknown, and most of his actions occur behind the scenes. He is searching for something unknown.
His particular style of storytelling in which he manipulates sand or smoke to illustrate his stories, as in [[Warbreaker\|Warbreaker]] and *The Way of Kings*, does not originate from *White Sand*, but from another unpublished story, *The Liar of Partinel*. In *Warbreaker*, Siri asked Hoid where he learned his style of story telling. Hoid answered, "I learned it many, many years ago from a man who didn't know who he was, Your Majesty. It was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died. But that is unimportant." His origin will be revealed in the *Dragonsteel* series, and so it is commonly believed Hoid is from [[Yolen\|Yolen]], the world of *Dragonsteel* and *Liar*. He also has a "home base" somewhere in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
Hoid is neither the author of the [[Ars Arcanum\|Ars Arcana]], nor of the back-of-book blurbs for *The Stormlight Archive*. He occasionally will show up somewhere, stand around for a while, realize there isn't a novel-worthy plot going on, and leave.

## Appearance & Personality
 by  Randy Bishop 
For more images, see [[Hoid/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Hoid's appearance varies dramatically from book to book. He's often in disguise, which makes his true appearance difficult to ascertain. Couple this with the fact that he can Lightweave his appearance in order to look however he wants, it makes it nearly impossible to know for sure what he looks like. To the best of our knowledge, his face is lined, hawk-like and arrow shaped. Hoid is tall and thin and also has a sharp nose and jaw with delicate eyebrows. He tends to cock his head to one side and has keen blue eyes. Hoid's hair is white, though he was not born with that color and he occasionally dyes it. There is a particular reason for his hair being white, which will be revealed in the future.
Hoid's true personality, while also usually disguised, is more easily seen as he occasionally drops whatever part he is playing. One of his overall most noticeable traits is his sharp wit and intelligence. The characters he plays often have a penchant for jokes and mockery but when he removes the facade his personality often seems mysterious and grave. If he was asked about whether he called himself a good man personality-wise, Hoid would reply with a "No". Hoid is not always serious when he should be, due to how much normal human interaction bores him.
Hoid cannot directly physically harm people; this is an involuntary trait that is the result of changes to his spirit made during his time as a [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]]. Rock says he cannot hurt man because it is forbidden by other gods. He also tells a young Shallan, "You needn't fear me. I'm terribly ineffective at hurting people. I blame my upbringing." Hoid apologizes to Kelsier after beating him in a fight, stating he doesn't have the inclination to do real harm to him. This aversion causes him to be nauseated when thinking about physically harming someone, and is sometimes bad enough to incapacitate him. However, this only extends to physical trauma- Hoid has no issues with mentally hurting someone or through inaction. Hoid also has issues with harming himself physically, such as when he has to manipulate another man into punching him when he wants a tooth knocked out, rather than just doing it himself.
When he is on Roshar during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] and [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], serving as King [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin's]], and later Queen [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin's]] Wit, Hoid has the appearance of a man in his mid-30s with deep onyx hair. He wears a stiff black coat and carries a long thin sword at his waist. This blade is not magically Invested but has personal value to Hoid. It is a symbol of office for the King/Queen's Wit, though Hoid himself is not a skilled swordfighter.

## Attributes and Abilities
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

 by  taratjah  Creating illusions
Hoid does not yet have the abilities of every planet he's visited. Some of his powers predate the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], but none of them are gained through [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]. Hoid is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards, so he only gains access to manifestations of Investiture through more conventional, but more difficult ways. Hoid has access to multiple Invested Arts, but not an incredibly large number. He is likely the most powerful non-Shard entity in the cosmere, although a few of the older dragons and [[Aether\|aethers]] might rival him. There are only a few things in the cosmere that are capable of hurting him, one of which is likely [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], and he stays far away from all of them. Hoid also has an unknown [[Seon\|seon]].

### Illusions
>‚Äú*I see. You do not yet understand the nature of lies. I had that trouble myself, long ago. The Shards here are very strict. You will have to see the truth, child, before you can expand upon it. Just as a man should know the law before he breaks it.*‚Äù
\-Hoid on Lightweaving to Shallan[33]


Hoid has access to an Invested Art known as [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]] that originates from Yolen prior to the Shattering of Adonalsium. Lightweaving allows for the creation of optical and auditory illusions. This Lightweaving is much less restrictive than the later [[Illumination\|Rosharan variant]], and does not require a spren or Stormlight to function. Hoid sometimes makes use of this ability in his disguises although he has several ways of changing how he looks including practical effects. He may also make use of it in some of his storytelling, such as the pictures of [[Derethil\|Derethil]] and the *Wandersail* that Kaladin sees in the smoke when Hoid is telling him a story.
Hoid's Yolish Lightweaving does not always seem to function perfectly on Roshar; in fact, he needs help from Shallan to fully craft an illusion. His power is somehow limited, and he has trouble making some aspects of it work, even after multiple attempts. It is uncertain why this occurs and whether or not this issue is unique to Roshar. Hoid's bonding of a Cryptic will provide abilities that supplement his own Lightweaving and allows him to overcome his issues crafting illusions, although further impacts or resonances between the two are unknown. Hoid's access to Yolish Lightweaving does allow him to guide another Lightweaver's power, although this is not something he would be able to do with just any Invested Art.

### Worldhopping
Hoid travels between various planets within the cosmere by making use of [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularities]], places usually created by the presence of a Shard on a planet where the sheer power of Investiture causes the borders between the realms to be weakened. A knowledgeable person such as Hoid is able to transition from the Physical Realm to the Cognitive Realm. Hoid can then travel to a different world's subastral, as the distances between worlds in the Cognitive Realm are much smaller than in the Physical Realm. Hoid is very proficient at traveling in the Cognitive Realm. He can easily travel to any world that has an active [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]], even those worlds where the perpendicularities are dangerous to pass through such as the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. Hoid is known to be aware of perpendicularities on Scadrial, Sel, and Roshar, and likely knows of Nalthis's perpendicularity as well. While Hoid typically makes use of natural perpendicularities in his travels, later in life he may also have access to an ability that essentially allows him to generate his own personal perpendicularity, much like the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Transportation.

### Dawnshard
Hoid was once a Dawnshard at some point. His time holding it caused changes to his Spiritweb in a similar manner to [[Savant\|savantism]]. These changes meant that long-term Hoid found himself unable to inflict harm on any others, as well as unable to eat meat he believes was naturally produced (i.e., he could eat meat he believes was made in a lab or by magic). His Dawnshard is in some way connected to the First Gem, his eponymous topaz.


>‚Äú*Other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.*‚Äù
\-Hoid on his age[70]


Hoid has lived for many more years than any mortal human would be able to live. This immortality is an effect of some remnant of the weapon the original sixteen Vessels used to kill Adonalsium, the Dawnshards. Additionally, Hoid has not actually experienced all those years, instead making use of some time-dilation technique that may render him somehow unconscious or unaware. However, Hoid does not have the ability to travel backwards in time.

### Healing Factor
>‚Äú*I'd be surprised if that little knife of yours poses me any real threat, Kholin.*‚Äù
\-Hoid to Jasnah on her Shardblade[76]


Hoid has access to some sort of healing factor that is capable of repairing both the body and the [[Spiritweb\|soul]]. He is able to regenerate any damaged body parts at will, including his head. He can also heal from being stabbed [[Hemalurgy\|hemalurgically]]. Hoid is able to repress his healing factor in some way, preventing instantaneous healing, an ability that he makes use of in some of his disguises. This healing factor makes it very difficult to kill Hoid, although he is still at least somewhat vulnerable. The name of the manifestation of Investiture responsible for Hoid's healing is unknown, but it is ancient, likely originating from some Pre-Shattering source. It is uncertain whether or not this healing factor is at all related to Hoid's apparent agelessness, which is known to originate from a remnant of a weapon built to kill Adonalsium. Hoid is unafraid of Shardblades for multiple reasons, probably including his healing factor.

### Fortune
>‚Äú*I have discovered a place that I must be, though to be honest I'm not exactly sure why I need to be there. This doesn't always work as well as I'd like it to.*‚Äù
\-Hoid to Dalinar[1]

Hoid has access to an ability that allows him to make use of the Spiritual attribute of [[Fortune\|Fortune]],, which grants him a limited amount of foresight. Hoid's Fortune ability gives him an innate knowledge of where and when he needs to be. While this ability may grant him knowledge of what he is to do, usually Hoid does not know why his ability has brought him to a specific place. Hoid's Fortune ability is not infallible; occasionally it directs him to go somewhere, but either nothing notable is happening or he is unable to discover the reason why he has been led there. Hoid's fortune ability has let him know about instant noodles, although he has had prior experience with them on Taldain.

### Connection
Hoid has access to some manifestation of Investiture that allows him to manipulate the Spiritual attribute of [[Connection\|Connection]]. The full extent of this ability is unknown, but its primary known use is to help Hoid speak the various languages of the worlds of the cosmere that he visits. The ability allows him to Connect to whatever land he is in, temporarily altering his Spiritual aspect to believe that he was raised in that place, allowing him to speak as a native. While Hoid has learned naturally how to speak some foreign languages, and is decent with languages, he desires to pass as a local oftentimes, which requires something beyond natural learning. Generally he makes use of the his Connection ability to communicate in foreign languages. This ability is not without fault though, as when Hoid speaks naturally it will fill in local idioms and phrases on its own, but if Hoid is careless and focuses on a specific word or phrase the ability may fail and he will say the word verbatim in his own tongue or it may be said in an odd way. Hoid is an expert in using his Connection ability, but even he sometimes makes mistakes. This is the reason he occasionally slips up and may say words that confuse others, such as "coin" and "bunny" on Roshar. As Hoid has demonstrated the ability to fluently speak foreign languages before the knowledge of unsealed metalminds became widespread, it is unlikely that he is making use of Feruchemical [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] to manipulate Connection.


Hoid, via unknown means, is able to enter and exit certain [[Visions\|visions]], as well as bring those he is bonded with, like Design. While doing so, he creates a large, pure white bubble of light, which can shelter those who have been brought into the vision naturally. While in the vision, Hoid is able to create whatever objects he wants. Hoid is only able to do this for roughly twenty minutes before being detected.

 by  Katie Payne 
### Metallic Arts
Hoid has also gained access to Allomancy, by burning a bead of lerasium stolen from the Well of Ascension. This grants him power equivalent to that of the ancient Allomancers. It is uncertain how practiced he is with these powers, but he does make use of emotional Allomancy on at least one occasion. He also has access to [[Atium\|atium]]. It is unknown whether or not Hoid has access to Feruchemy. However, he does have access to some unkeyed metalminds, which would not be useful to him without Feruchemical abilities. The particular attributes that are stored in these metalminds are unknown. Hoid does not make use of Hemalurgy, to gain access to the Metallic Arts or any other manifestation of Investiture, as he is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards. He does, however, own many Hemalurgic spikes.

### Awakening
>‚Äú*Perfect pitch makes this all so much easier than it once was....*‚Äù
\-Hoid to Kaladin on making music[91]


As a Yolish man, Hoid was not himself born with any [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]]. However at some point Hoid has gained access to enough BioChromatic Breath to bring him to at least the Second Heightening. This means Hoid has at least two hundred Breaths, which grant him the ability to recognize unsupressed Breath auras and judge about how much breath another Awakener has, as well as perfect pitch. That is not to say that Hoid may not have reached a higher Heightening, just that the second Heightening is his minimum power level. Hoid's level of skill with [[Awakening\|Awakening]] is still unknown, as he has only made use of it on one known occasion, when he Awakened a doll, causing it to walk. This makes it difficult to ascertain his knowledge of Commands or complex Awakenings. Hoid's level of control over Investiture does allow him to suppress his Breath aura, making it difficult to notice by others. However, there are various methods of detecting Investiture that could circumvent this suppression. Hoid's perfect pitch does aid him in tuning instruments and making music. Additionally, holding Breath has allowed Hoid to somehow outsource some of his memory to said Breath. After [[Odium\|Odium's]] destruction of some of these Breaths in order to wipe his short-term memory, his level of Breath was reduced to just under the Second Heightening, resulting in a loss of perfect pitch.

### Surgebinder
 by  Elisgardor  Hoid with [[Design\|Design]]
>‚Äú*It's either go with me now or wait it out and get captured. I honestly don't even know if you've the mind to listen. But if you do, know this: I will give you truths. And I know some juicy ones.*‚Äù
\-Hoid to his Cryptic, Design[35]


Hoid has bonded the [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] [[Design\|Design]], which grants him access to Surgebinding. While the enhanced reflexes and healing permitted by Stormlight will likely be less useful to Hoid, the [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] allows him to access the surges of [[Illumination\|Illumination]] and [[Transformation\|Transformation]]. This allows Hoid to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]], transforming one type of matter to another by persuading its Cognitive aspect as well as Lightweaving, which grants him the ability to create visual and auditory illusions. This Rosharan Lightweaving seems to have a compounding effect with his Yolish Lightweaving, and allows him to circumvent the problems that he has experienced with his own illusions. Although Hoid's Ideals are unknown, it may eventually grant him a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]].

### Storytelling Method
Hoid tells stories with smoke and sand, literally.


In *Warbreaker*, [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] calls Hoid to tell the story of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] history to him and [[Siri\|Siri]]. As he told the story, he dropped sands, dusts, and small objects.
As he told the story he began by trailing sand out of his hand, then he added a powdery black sand, when both trails mixed it became a white sand. He began to scatter fern leaves and then threw the handful up with blue and deep red dust making it seem like a minor explosion. He sprinkled silver glitter in front of him, then trailed powdery brown dirt. Black dust, and then [[Tears of Edgli\|flower petals]]. He then sent out a spray of half a dozen colors from both hands. Then bright yellow dust from one hand and black from the other. Torn writing on paper, followed by metal bits, black charcoal dust from both hands, he crumbled clay, sprinkled golden dust around, bits of grass and earth, a white powder and then a spray of water that turned into mist.


While telling stories with smoke he uses a flute, blowing the smoke, it may be [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]] that causes patterns and images to appear in smoke.
In *The Way of Kings* the chasms echoed the music allowing him to speak and play without the music ever seeming to stop. It is unclear how the flute could be used without chasms or canyons.

## History
### Origins
Very little of Hoid's origin is known, beyond the fact that he was present at the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] on [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. He knew at least some of the original [[Vessel\|Vessels]] personally, was friends with [[Rayse\|Rayse]], and [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]] once bought him a drink. Hoid was offered a Shard at the time of the Shattering, but refused to take it. He kind of considered the Shattering necessary. He also did something in his past that he regretted. At some point Hoid became an unknown [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]], which changed him permanently, although he stopped being one eventually.
Hoid makes at least a cameo appearance in most cosmere works, one exception being [[Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell\|Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell]].

### Taldain
Hoid traveled to [[Taldain\|Taldain]], though for what reasons are unknown. He was there when the [[Taishin\|Taishin]] were deciding whether or not to disband the [[Diem\|Diem]]. Hoid later got onto the boat [[Khriss\|Khriss]] took to return to [[Darkside\|Darkside]], where he sang a song to the passengers about the meaning of art.

### The Restoration of Elantris and Theft of the Moon Scepter
>‚Äú*There is beauty in every disaster, friend, if you are clever enough to find it."*‚Äù
\-Hoid to a skaze[118]


Hoid traveled to [[Sel\|Sel]], likely making use of [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Devotion's Perpendicularity]] in [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. Hoid spoke to the [[Skaze\|skaze]], and seems to have made some sort of agreement with them hinging on his desire to become an Elantrian with the restoration of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]]. Hoid disguised himself as a beggar, wrapped in bandages. He helped [[Sarene\|Sarene]] smuggle weapons into Elantris. Following the restoration of the city by Raoden, Hoid traveled to the Pool to meet a skaze. He removed his bandages, hoping to find himself transformed into an Elantrian, but the transformation had not occurred. The skaze ridiculed Hoid for his failure, but Hoid expressed his joy that secrets still remained unknown to him and then entered the Perpendicularity and transitioned to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
Hoid returned to Sel several years later, and found himself a position in the court of Emperor [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]] in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] as the Royal Fool. He allied himself with the [[Forger\|Forger]] [[Shai\|Shai]] in her attempt to steal the [[Moon Scepter\|Moon Scepter]], an artifact that allows for the translation of the various symbols of Selish Investiture. He arranged for her to be caught after she'd left the Gallery with the Scepter, later using her duplicate to steal the scepter for himself. Hoid stole the Moon Scepter in order to help him translate between various symbols and gain access to the magics on Sel.

### The Collapse of the Final Empire and Catacendre
Hoid arrived on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], likely through Ruin's Perpendicularity in the Pits of Hathsin. He took up the guise of an informant, pretending to have bad eyesight in order to make himself less threatening to people seeking information from him. At some point he became known to both [[Dockson\|Dockson]] and [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]]. [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], pretending to be a nobleman, contacted Hoid, requesting information on House Renoux. Hoid (closed shop, smoking tobacco) met with Kelsier on the streets of Luthadel and told him that House Renoux was buying large amounts of weapons and armor from various noble houses and that Lord Renoux was considering a marriage between Valette and Elend Venture. He also claimed that Renoux was rumored to have some sort of leverage on Venture and that he knew [[Shan Elariel\|Shan Elariel]] to be a [[Soother\|Soother]]. At some point following this, he left Scadrial to attend to other business, again likely via the Pits.

 by  LittleGreyDragon  [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and Hoid's meeting at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]
Around a year later, Hoid returned to Scadrial, traveling through Scadrial's subastral, riding on the back of a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] to the Well of Ascension, Preservation's Perpendicularity. He was using an oar coated with a strange glowing substance connected to the substance drunk by members of the [[Ire\|Ire]]. He encountered the Shadow of Kelsier, who asked for help returning to the Physical Realm. Hoid told him that there was nothing to be done, but he challenged Kelsier to an insult battle, with the prize being the true answer to one question. Kelsier instead threatened Hoid. Hoid attempted to enter the pool, but Kelsier attacked him. Hoid easily overpowered Kelsier and caused him serious pain, but not permanent injury. Hoid then transitioned through the Well and stole a bead of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] from the adjacent room. He later consumed the lerasium and became a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]]. When Kelsier spoke of the incident to Preservation, Preservation spoke briefly on Hoid, calling him Cephandrius. Later, Kelsier told [[Khriss\|Khriss]] and [[Nazh\|Nazh]] about his meeting with Hoid, and they seemed distressed to know that he had arrived and stolen a bead of lerasium.
Hoid then traveled to the [[Terris Dominance\|Terris Dominance]] to figure out [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], and then became wrapped up in matters he did not anticipate. This may refer to him becoming involved after the [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]] attack on [[Tathingdwen\|Tathingdwen]] and the slaughter of the [[Synod\|Synod]]. Hoid took up the guise of a Terris leader and led the Terris refugees to the Central Dominance.
A year later, Hoid was in [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]], again acting as an informant, and Ashweather Cett suggested Vin speak to him. Just before Vin arrived, Kelsier's Cognitive Shadow noticed Hoid from within the Cognitive Realm. Kelsier tried to touch Hoid's soul, but was rebuffed by a shock that numbed his hand. At that moment, Vin arrived intending to meet with Hoid, but Kelsier attempted to warn her away. Since he was in the Cognitive Realm, he couldn't communicate with her directly, but she did sense that something was off about Hoid and instead chose not to speak to him.

### Nalthis
Hoid traveled to [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] and took the role of a master storyteller. [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] summoned him to the [[Court of the Gods\|Court of the Gods]], where he recounted the story of [[Vo\|Vo]], explained the origin of the [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] God Kings, and answered Lightsong and [[Siri\|Siri's]] questions. He likely achieved perfect pitch while on this world by obtaining additional Breaths. At some later point, [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] also met Hoid; she later described him as one of the only people on Nalthis that is cosmere-aware.
Hoid spent a lot of time gambling on Nalthis, and was fairly renowned. He would arrange things so that he could never lose, and then bet everything on himself. However, someone else managed to arrange it so that he couldn't *win*, either, resulting in a tie and the loss of his winnings.
[[Vasher\|Vasher]] once met Hoid when he was using the alias "Dust", several years before Vasher's activities on Roshar.

### Obrodai
Hoid visited [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]] at some point prior to the True Desolation. A female avatar was created by [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] and instilled with a great dislike of Hoid in order to prevent him from returning there.

### Roshar
>‚Äú*I've come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but I end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead.*‚Äù
\-Hoid to Kaladin.[3]



While rescuing [[Design\|Design]] before leaving [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], he recognizes one of the [[Fused\|Fused]] as [[Vatwha\|Vatwha]], an old acquaintance. At some point, "thousands of years ago," Hoid visited Roshar and mingled with the original inhabitants of the world, even dancing with the ancient [[Singer\|singers]]. The Fused, however, are now trained to watch for him - most likely to capture him and deliver him to [[Odium\|Odium]].
Hoid is worshipped by the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] as *Lunu'anaki*, the god of travel and mischief who cannot hurt man.
Hoid is a member of the [[Worldsingers\|Worldsingers]] with the rank of Master Worldsinger. [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] was once his apprentice.
He has been to Aimia at some point.


 by  ShiroXIX  Insulting the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]
In a departure from his previous appearances, Hoid plays a more conspicuous role in the events on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], since his goal is to become a Radiant. Most often seen under the guise of Wit, [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin's]] court jester, he influences [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], going so far as to ask Dalinar if he has ever heard the term "Adonalsium". He also tells [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] the story of [[Derethil\|Derethil]] and the *Wandersail*. During the course of the story, Hoid uses a special, ancient flute called a [[Trailman's flute\|Trailman's flute]]. It is also likely that he uses [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]] to cause the smoke from the fire to take the form of various elements from his story. [[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] was hired by three men from the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]] to search for Hoid in the [[Purelake\|Purelake]]. Hoid was in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] when [[Taln\|Taln]] arrived to herald the coming of the [[Desolation\|Desolation]].

 by  Marie Seeberger  [[Shallan\|Shallan]] hugging Wit

Hoid again plays a minor role as Wit, though he is absent for most of the book. In Shallan's flashback to three and a half years ago, she meets Hoid disguised as a messenger, and he talks to her. Here, Hoid is seen ingesting metals and Soothing Shallan. [[Rock\|Rock]] also describes an encounter with him in the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]].
Hoid is also seen acting as the carriage driver for [[Adolin\|Adolin]] when he is visiting [[Shallan\|Shallan]] at [[Shattered Plains\|Sebarial's warcamp]]. He speaks to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] about his flute and mentions that he wants an interesting story from him. When [[Shallan\|Shallan]] recognizes him she happily hugs him for his advice from three and a half years prior when he encouraged her at her worst and told her to keep seeking the light.
Hoid, acting as Wit, visits [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] while he is in prison. He tells Kaladin the story of a man named Fleet who raced a highstorm across one end of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] to the other. Fleet wins, but dies of exhaustion at the end, and his spirit goes on to race the wind forever.
Later, at the end of the book, he meets with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] as she exits the Cognitive Realm, offering to travel with her.


The white-haired man who [[Lift\|Lift]] says jumped into the mouth of a [[Greatshell\|greatshell]] is implied to be Hoid.


 by  taratjah  Hoid, in his Wit persona
The three letters in part two of Oathbringer are directed at Cephandrius. The first two explicitly say this, while the third simply says "friend". It is likely that they are all referring to the same person.
Hoid appears as Wit in the middle of the novel, discussing the nature of power with Shallan. Prior to that, while telling the story of Mishim in Alethkar, Hoid sees something next to his pack, which startles him. After the story, Shallan looks into Hoid's pack and sees a small, sealed black jar. The side of the jar pointing at Shallan was white. This might be a jar of sand from [[Taldain\|Taldain's]] Dayside, with the sand turning white showing Hoid a Surgebinder is near. This may be important, but not much is known about it. During Hoid's conversation with Shallan, he says that he knew of a group like the Cult of Moments, describing them as equally foolish and dangerous. It is unclear at the moment which group he may be referring to.
He later helps her get into the Cult of Moments, finding Shallan at her darkest moment, when she discovers the food she has been giving to the poor is just making things worse.
[[Shalash\|Shalash]], upon seeing sketches of [[Talenel\|Talenel]] and herself, wonders aloud why Midius (a name taken by Hoid in an as-yet-unpublished text) is giving away drawings of them.
In the epilogue, Hoid is shown in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] insulting a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] man in an attempt to elicit a reaction. Upon realizing that the man can't understand Alethi, Hoid decides repeating it all in Thaylen would be boring, so he cuts in front of the man. The man hits Hoid, knocking loose a tooth which Hoid discards upon leaving the area. Hoid uses [[Awakening\|Awakening]] to lure a child away from the corpse of her mother, leaving the child in the care of a family in the city. He then heads to the palace where he finds a [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]], presumably the spren [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] was about to bond before he died.


[[Cord\|Cord]] mentions that in the time when her grandmother served as watcher of the [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|pool]], Hoid warned the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] about the [[Sleepless\|Gods Who Sleep Not]].


 by  Jenny Slife  With Frost
In the epigraphs in Part 2 of The Way of Kings, there is the text of a [[Letters\|letter]] written by Hoid to [[Frost\|Frost]]. It offers valuable insights into his personality and goals. The author of the Letter is being hunted by the Seventeenth Shard and has set a false trail for them to follow, which lines up well with the interlude in which three men are searching for Hoid. The author comes across as not at all worried about them, and in fact seems mildly amused. Brandon has also said that we "may have read that Hoid has specific beef with Rayse," with the Letter being the only real example of this.
The Letters in [[Oathbringer\|Oathbringer's]] epigraphs are all from Shards and all of them are directed to Hoid, as is the letter from the epigraphs of Part 2 of [[Rhythm of War\|Rhythm of War]].

### Post-Catacendric Scadrial
>‚Äú*Oh, my lord, I know it, I do. I own the place, technically. Now, regarding those coins for old Hoid, my good lord...*‚Äù
\-Hoid to Wax[144]


At some point following his actions on Roshar, Hoid returned to Scadrial to attend the [[Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner\|wedding]] of Lord [[Joshin Yomen\|Joshin Yomen]] and Lady [[Mi'chelle Ostlin\|Mi'chelle Ostlin]], two friends of his that he had made at some unknown point in the past. Rather than coming to Scadrial in response to some important event, Hoid initially came merely to congratulate his friends. He came dressed all in black, appearing as a scruffy looking beggar and spoke to the couple soon after they arrived at the dinner. It is unknown if he was present for the subsequent Vanisher attack. Hoid may have left the planet briefly afterwards, but something on Scadrial had caught his attention and he was back several months later. Hoid became employed as [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] new carriage driver. By that point he had become friendly with Wayne, who liked him but did not know anything about Hoid's true identity. When Wax headed to the precinct station to question [[Rian\|Rian]], Hoid drove the carriage and Wayne rode up front with him. During the carriage ride, Hoid eavesdropped on Wax's conversation with [[Harmony\|Harmony]] about Bleeder's plans to disrupt the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]].
Hoid's actions after this point are unclear. Hoid somehow obtained a coin-like unsealed metalmind containing a memory of [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] aiding the [[Southern Peoples of Scadrial\|southern Scadrians]] in surviving the aftereffects of the Catacendre. He also spent some time in [[New Seran\|New Seran]] and following [[Nazh\|Nazh's]] theft of [[Nicki Savage\|Nicki Savage's]] map of New Seran, Hoid asked her if she wanted to hear a story, an offer that she declined. He has also somehow come to the conclusion that he is the true owner of [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores']] mansion there, for somewhat legitimate but unknown reasons. He was apparently a regular intruder on the mansion grounds, to the irritation of the guards. During this time, Hoid took the appearance of a beggar with long, unkempt fingernails and a ragged shirt. Hoid appeared blind with milky white eyes.
When Waxillium Ladrian walked up the path to Kelesina's mansion to attend a [[Kelesina Shores' party\|party]] with [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]], Hoid climbed out of the bushes, startling Wax. Wanting to reveal Kelsier's resurrection and identity as the Sovereign, Hoid looked for an opportunity to pass on the unsealed metalmind. He asked Wax for a few clips. Steris noticed Hoid's cologne and asked him if he was wearing cologne. Hoid was startled by her observation and claimed that he had been drinking perfume, as it had quite a kick. Steris told him that that was unhealthy and Wax advised Hoid that he should leave the private grounds. Hoid agreed but claimed that it was his property and again asked for coins. Wax gave him a banknote and told him again to leave the grounds. Hoid claimed it was far too much and that he wished to give Waxillium change. As Wax walked away, Hoid threw the coin at Wax's head, who caught it in midair. A groundsman then noticed Hoid and tried to chase him off. Hoid laughed and escaped back into the bushes again.

## Relationships
Due to his nature as a worldhopper, Hoid has met most of the main characters in the cosmere, as well as a large quantity of side characters.

### The Shards
Hoid's relationships with the various [[Vessel\|Vessels]] are varied, to say the least, ranging from hate and terror to respect and cameraderie.


Hoid was acquainted with [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]] before the Shattering.


Hoid was once friends with [[Rayse\|Rayse]], but is now terrified of the Shard, and takes many precautions against him. However, he is not above taunting the Shard, as he feels him to be the most detestable person he has ever met, albeit preferably from a position of superiority.


Prior to [[Taravangian\|Taravangian's]] Ascension, Hoid had never notably interacted with him. However, after the occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], when going to challenge Rayse, he realized that a new Vessel had Ascended, and was completely terrified, as Rayse was controlled by the power, but a new Vessel might have more control. However, Taravangian destroyed the Breaths holding his short-term memory, so he did not believe anything to be amiss.


Hoid, while not *enemies* with [[Koravellium\|Koravellium]], has never really gotten along with her. However, he recognizes the fact that she poses a threat to Odium, and respects that.


[[Sazed\|Sazed]] has a benevolent feeling towards Hoid. However, the latter has nevertheless hidden from the Shard whenever he visits [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], a decision of which Sazed disapproves, but by which he is also fascinated. He wishes to work with Hoid to keep Odium contained, as he is highly disturbed by the wound upon the Spiritual Realm where Ambition was Splintered. They disagree on whether it is the Vessel or the power that is more dangerous, with Sazed believing that the Investiture will make any Vessel of Odium the same as their predecessor, but they agree that it would be the combination of a Vessel's craftiness and the power's Intent that would be most fearsome--coincidentally, a very good description of Taravangian.


Hoid has a long-standing grudge against [[Bavadin\|Bavadin]] for unknown reasons. She has instilled in many of her avatars, including the one on [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]], a deep dislike of him; however, he and Bavadin herself had a relationship at some point.


Hoid and [[Edgli\|Edgli]] mutually detest each other. However, their conversations are far more polite than Hoid's relations with Bavadin or Rayse.

### Cosmere-Wide

Hoid thinks well of Khriss. Although it is unknown how much information she has shared with him, she knows far more about the cosmere than he, as she pursues the knowledge for the sake of scholarship, while he uses it to sound smart and achieve his goals. If he were to ask her about something that she knew, though, and she perceived that he was asking for a morally good reason, she would tell him.


Hoid is quite dismissive of the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]]. Although they fear that his actions will exacerbate Shardic conflict due to their non-interventionist policy, he easily evades those whom they assign to pursue him.


Hoid and [[Frost\|Frost]] know each other well, having worked together in the past, and have a method of communicating with one another besides an interplanetary "postal service" that exists. Despite this, they are completely opposed on the courses of action that would be best for the cosmere. Frost, as a member of the Seventeenth Shard, believes that the best course of action is to let events play out as they will, especially in regard to [[Odium\|Odium's]] growing power and ambiton. However, as Hoid is a worldhopper and Frost is not, the former believes that he has a more informed stance, and plans to take more active action against the Shard.


Hoid has a very different opinion of the Ghostbloods than he does of their leader, viewing them as generally not a threat.

### Roshar
In his position as King's, and later, Queen's Wit, Hoid has had opportunities to interact with many notable Rosharans, and has taken full advantage of such chances.


Hoid feels paternally to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. In such situations as when Kaladin is terrified at the discovery of his Radiant powers, languishing in prison, or trapped in a vision concocted by Odium and [[Moash\|Moash]] in order to try and break him, Hoid is always there with a story to bring him back from the brink, and at one point gave Kaladin his [[Trailman's flute\|Trailman's flute]].


Hoid feels similarly to [[Shallan\|Shallan]] as he does to Kaladin. Visiting her in times of need, such as when her father is growing more and more abusive or when she's sitting in a dark building in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], racked with guilt about [[Grund\|Grund's]] death, he guides her to a path of self-forgiveness.


Hoid's relationship with [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] seems similar to that of Jasnah and Shallan. When in Azir, Hoid found Sigzil to be in some sort of trouble, and, after rescuing him, took the young [[Azish\|Azish]] man under his wing and began teaching him as a [[Worldsinger\|Worldsinger]]. The two traveled [[Roshar\|Roshar]] together, at one point ending up in [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]], where Hoid had to pay for Sigzil to be freed three separate times, though Sigzil suspected that they mainly arrested him because Hoid had a lot of money. Hoid graduated him as a full Worldsinger in Tanat 1173.


Hoid has a fondly exasperated view towards [[Design\|Design]]. Though, as a pair who share a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]], they are extremely close, he is consistently frustrated by her habit of spoiling stories that he's telling, as he sees it.

 by  Jessica Liu  With [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]]

Hoid is romantically involved with [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]]. He also has immense respect for her, both due to her sheer intelligence and the fact that, when all else fails, she is, above all, paranoid. Jasnah notes that he seems to think such things as kissing her safehand would spark passion in her, though it is her view that mental stimulation is far superior.


Hoid dislikes Sadeas, insulting him at any chance he gets. Though at first he tries to get Sadeas to kill him in order to remove the man as a threat (since Shardblades are unable to hurt him anyway), he makes fun of Sadeas after his death just for the fun of it.

### Scadrial

[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and Hoid mutually detest one another. Hoid considers him extremely dangerous, though he doesn't think much of his organization. However, this doesn't stop him from taking action against the Cognitive Shadow, such as when he gives [[Wax\|Wax]] a [[Coppermind\|coppermind]] containing knowledge that Kelsier would have preferred to have stayed hidden.

## Speculation
### Worldsingers & Worldbringers
The names of the [[Worldsingers\|Worldsingers]], a group of storytellers on Roshar, and the Conclave of [[Worldbringers\|Worldbringers]], the leading body of the original [[Terris\|Terris]] religion, are strikingly similar. Brandon has stated that this is not a coincidence. Some believe that Hoid is a common root to both of these organizations, one of which, the Worldbringers, was very [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatically]] aware.
