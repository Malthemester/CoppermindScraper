## Appearance and Personality
Shob is rather talkative. He is a hypochondriac and often claims that he is dying; he also claims to be turning into a [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]], based on a nonexistent rash on his arm. He is presumably of the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] faith, as he wears a [[Glyphward\|glyphward]] wrapped around the "rash". He is uncouth, and [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]] is repelled when he discusses his boils and picks his nose in front of her.

## Attributes and Abilities
He speaks in what seems to be a [[Bav\|Bav]] accent, though some sentences come out with a more neutral intonation.
He enjoys playing cards and other games with his friends, including Vathah, [[Gaz\|Gaz]], and [[Red (Roshar)\|Red]]. He is skilled at [[Pieces\|pieces]], and enjoys the game even if it is being played for [[Ends\|ends]].

## History
Shob's past is mysterious, but he likely hails from [[Bavland\|Bavland]], based on his accent. He has at least two brothers. Towards the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], he fought for an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] army on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] (presumably that of [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]]), but he deserted the army for unknown reasons, becoming a fugitive. He joined a band of other deserters led by [[Vathah\|Vathah]] that roamed the [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] stealing food from travelers, trying to stay alive and forget their pasts. In late 1173, the group intended to attack [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv]] and [[Macob\|Macob's]] caravans, but [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] intervened and convinced them to instead defend the caravans against another group of bandits.
As part of Vathah's group, Shob accompanied Shallan to the Shattered Plains. His past crimes were pardoned and he was housed in the [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]] warcamp. He presumably participated in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and the move to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. In Urithiru, Shob was one of twelve former deserters (of the original group of around twenty-five) that was still alive and loyal to Shallan. He remained employed as one of Shallan's guards, although she rarely had anything for them to do.
Unlike his friends Red, Gaz, and Vathah, Shob was not chosen to train in spycraft with Ishnah. Most of the former deserters became [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]] squires and members of the [[Unseen Court\|Unseen Court]], but it is not clear if Shob was among them.
