A **Sliver** is a human intelligence who has held all or a very large portion of the power of a [[Shard\|Shard]] and has since released it. There is a certain threshold of power where one would be considered a Sliver of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. Every person on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] has a bit of the power of [[Preservation\|Preservation]], but they are not technically Slivers. Though there is some grey area in what it means to be a Sliver, individuals who have directly held the power of a Shard are usually termed Slivers.

## Qualities of a Sliver
Being a Sliver changes a person, there is a residue left behind in a person. This residue has many effects, one of which is that a person who is capable of noticing [[Investiture\|Investiture]] would be able to look at someone and tell that they are a Sliver. Holding a large portion of a Shard is similar to inflating a balloon. It is unknown what effects this expansion of their mind and spirit ultimately has on a person. Slivers are more resistant to the influence and control from Shards.
A Sliver is also not required to be pulled into the [[Beyond\|Beyond]]. However, if a Sliver should desire to go, they are able to willingly leave instead of persisting forever.
