## Appearance
### Physical Realm
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], cultivationspren take the form of a vine that grows rapidly. This vine appears to be speckled with smooth flecks of quartz, but it does not glow with Stormlight. They can form the appearance of face by curling vines around one another. After a time, the vine trail they leave behind solidifies, becoming like crystal before crumbling into dust.

### Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], cultivationspren are, like other sapient spren, humanoid. They appear to be composed mostly of vines, and their faces look as though they are composed of green string. Their hands, eyes, and teeth made of crystal, though their hands are still as flexible as flesh.
They all wear clothing, which doesn't seem to necessarily be part of their essence -- one female cultivationspren was spotted wearing a vorin [[Havah\|havah]].
A [[Deadeye\|deadeye]] cultivationspren looks similarly to a living one, albeit dried out. Rather than vines, their bodies look as though made of ashen brown cords thin as hair, giving the appearance of rough cloth or a cluster of brown vines. They also have long nails.

## Abilities
Out of all spren, cultivationspren are the best at manifesting souls from beads in Shadesmar. For this reason, they often work creating gardens for other spren. Rather than plants, cultivationspren gardeners create elaborate structures out of objects such as chairs.
In the Physical Realm, cultivationspren are invisible to all but their Surgebinder, although the remnants of their vines disintegrating can be seen. They can also not be heard by others as well.

### Nahel bond
Cultivationspren can form [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] with humans. Through this, they can grant the [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities of [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]] and [[Progression\|Progression]]. Like other Radiant spren, they lose their memories upon entering the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], although it seems as though the [[Ring\|Ring]] has some ability to lessen this effect by careful preparation.

While the origins of the cultivationspren are unknown, it's possible that they were created by [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] herself. Back in the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], cultivationspren began forming [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] with humans, creating the [[Order of Edgedancers\|Order of Edgedancers]]. When the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] came, they were decimated, with anyone who would know how the Bond works turned [[Deadeye\|deadeye]]. Over the millenia, their society recovered somewhat, albeit they never created grand cities or a nation.
Shortly before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], they saw the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] and the [[Cryptic\|Cryptics]] begin to bond humans again, and decided that they must keep up. The [[Ring\|Ring]], their ruling body, sent [[Wyndle\|Wyndle]] to bond with [[Lift\|Lift]], and possibly some other spren as well.
When travelling through [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] and [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] group encountered a cultivationspren working as a dock registrar in [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]]. He was the one to explain the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] presence in the city to them, and later stalled the [[Fused\|Fused]] so that they could escape. Wyndle and his Radiant Lift proved invalauable in securing the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]] for Dalinar to use to trap [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]].
In the year following the battle, even more cultivationspren bonded with humans to create more Radiants. The cultivationspren as a group were generally disposed favorably to the newly refounded order of the Edgedancers.

Fittingly, cultivationspren seem to worship Cultivation more so than [[Honor\|Honor]], swearing by her name and calling her Mother. They are skittery and often fearful, seeking to avoid bringing danger upon themselves. When push comes to shove, however, they can be relied on regardless of how dangerous a situation is.
It's unknown what their general attitude towards humans is, but the ones seen so far are not opposed to [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]], with the dock registrar in particular being excited about the return of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Going by his comments, this is a wide-spread opinion.
Unlike other sapient spren, cultivationspren don't have their own nation or settlements in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. Rather, they live alongside other spren in cities where various types intermingle, like [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]]. Nonetheless, they have their own government, a council known as the [[Ring\|Ring]], which in the present day is responsible for choosing which of their kind should bond who.
