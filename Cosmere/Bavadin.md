## Appearance and Personality
 by  More Cynical Than Funny 
Though she herself is female, Bavadin has a habit of taking on multiple forms and appearances. She has several male and female personas, and will often present herself as different people to the same culture; race, gender and other qualities are fluid where she is concerned. Bavadin seems fond of changing her appearance, and she does so daily. Even her original species is unclear; she is not a dragon, but it's unknown whether she's human or [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]].
Bavadin's interpretation of Autonomy lends itself to strict isolationism; she forbids travel to and from [[Taldain\|Taldain]], to the detriment of worldhoppers from that planet. However, she is willing to meddle in the affairs of other worlds. She is fond of creating avatars, sapient entities which hold a portion of Autonomy's power but are independent of her. Their personalities are carefully shaped by Bavadin. At least one of them is haughty and self-assured, although it seems it is not a trait shared by all others, and thus it's unclear if Bavadin herself is like this.

## Abilities and Attributes
 by  zoethatcher_art  Bavadin and her avatars
Bavadin is a Vessel of a [[Shard\|Shard]], making her ageless, incorporeal and incredibly powerful. Whether Autonomy grants her any unique strengths or abilities is unknown, though she has the capability to bar people from accessing [[Taldain\|Taldain]] through the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. She seems to be a skilled and keen actor, capable of assuming dozens of made-up personas; there are entire pantheons of gods where every deity is actually Bavadin in a different disguise.

## History
Like all original Vessels, Bavadin came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. She and a number of others killed the creator-god, [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and split up his power into sixteen pieces. Bavadin herself picked up the piece which became Autonomy and departed Yolen, eventually winding up in [[Taldain\|Taldain]], where she [[Investiture\|Invested]] herself in the local sun.

For subsequent events, see Autonomy#History.
## Relationships
>“*You must know better than to approach us by relying upon presumption of past relationship.*”
\-Patji to Hoid[16]


Bavadin seems to have had some alliance with [[Rayse\|Rayse]], the prior Vessel of [[Odium\|Odium]], although whether this alliance still stands with Taravangian, Odium's new vessel, is unclear. She assisted Rayse in splintering the shards of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]], though the extent and nature of this assistance is unknown. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] holds a deep grudge against both Bavadin and Rayse, for unknown, but related reasons. Bavadin herself doesn't seem to be overly fond of Hoid either, though they two have had a prior relationship of some nature. In the present, her avatars deeply dislike Hoid, and at least one of them -- the [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]] avatar -- has been instilled with deep dislike of him as a precaution.

## Trivia
Among the original Vessels, [[Brandon\|Brandon]] is very fond of Bavadin. Part of the reason he regrets moving on from *White Sand* is that he cannot properly introduce Bavadin in-story just yet.
