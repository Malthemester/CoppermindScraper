## History
After surviving his judgement by the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] in 1173, a semi-conscious [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] thought that he should take fathom bark to reduce the swelling of his brain. He later took fathom bark to manage the pain in his leg after he was injured in the chasms of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] by a [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]]. While Kaladin was secretly tending to an unresponsive [[Teft\|Teft]] in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], fathom bark was one of the medical supplies that he procured with [[Kuno\|Kuno's]] help.
[[Tukks\|Tukks]] chewed fathom bark habitually.
