**Hope Flight** is a group of [[DDF\|DDF]] pilots who participated in the [[Battle of Alta\|Battle of Alta]]. There were originally eight members in the flight, with [[Judy Ivans\|Judy Ivans]], callsign: Ironsides, as their leader. [[Chaser\|Chaser]], [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] father, was part of Hope Flight.

## History
Hope Flight was formed in the early days of the DDF, mainly by inspiration of Chaser and Ironsides. Many DDF pilots, including Banks and Swing, believed that the humans should surrender to the [[Varvax\|Krell]] instead of fighting, but were convinced otherwise by those two. It is unknown if either Banks or Swing were in Hope Flight.
During the Battle of Alta, Chaser flew up through the debris field that surrounded the planet, leaving him vulnerable to Krell influence. When he returned, he believed his fellow pilots to be Krell ships and attacked them. On Ironsides's orders, Chaser wingmate, Mongrel, shot him down.
Chaser's actions led to him being branded a coward. This was specifically engineered by Ironsides as she believed it better he be branded a coward than a traitor. While his flightmates did not know exactly why he had turned on them, Ironsides knew it to be related to his cytonic abilities, known by high level Defiant Cavern officials as the "defect".
The surviving members of the Flight were awarded the rank of [[First Citizen\|First Citizen's]] for their participation in the battle and are given special privileges, including special quarters and influence. The children of the First Citizen's gain automatic entry to Flight School and do not need to sit the entrance exam.
