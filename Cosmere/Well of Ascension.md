## Purpose & Usage
 by  Eleonor Piteira  [[Vin\|Vin]] in the Well
As [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] is of Preservation, particularly strong Seekers such as Vin and [[Alendi\|Alendi]] could sense the pulsing of the Well of Ascension as it refills with power. This pulsing is a pure tone of Scadrial.

## History & Mythology
In [[Terris\|Terris]] prophecy, it was said to be hidden deep within the Terris Mountains. However, when the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] consumed the power from the Well of Ascension and changed the world, he also changed the location of the Well. The Well was moved to [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]], and lay in a chamber underneath the Lord Ruler's palace.
Before [[Vin\|Vin]] released the power within the Well, it served as a prison for the [[Shard\|Shard]] Ruin for several millennia. Preservation created the prison by sacrificing his mind to create something capable of containing Ruin's mind. With his mind gone, Preservation's body and power were left in the world, creating the Mists and the Well of Ascension.
It is unknown whether the Well still exists after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].

## Location
The entrance to the Well lies in the Lord Ruler's study, and was designed to be opened by an [[Iron\|Ironpull]] of tremendous strength, such that the Lord Ruler was one of the few individuals capable of opening it. One section of the wall, presumably weighing several tons, could be pulled on to reveal a passageway, which leads to the the stone chamber that houses the Well of Ascension. The Well appears as a shimmering, glowing white pool full of liquid metal. The pool lies in a shallow depression in the rock and is only a few feet in diameter.
