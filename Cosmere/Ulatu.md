An **ulatu** is a traditional men's garment worn in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Design
Ulatu are knee-length skirts. They can be made from silk, and are often worn with a simple shirt and a long robe or coat. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] notes that her great-grandfathers would have worn mink pelts with their ulatu. The ulatu has some similarities to the [[Takama\|takama]], but ulatu are typically shorter in length.

## Use
Contemporary Veden fashion is closely aligned with that of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and the ulatu is seen as outdated. The only Veden men seen wearing it are [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]] and three toughs led by [[Mill\|Mill]] that attempt to collect payment for [[Jushu\|Jushu's]] debts from Lin.
