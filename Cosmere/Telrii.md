**Telrii** is a nobleman in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He made a deal with [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] to become King of Arelon, but was killed in a duel shortly after ascending to the throne.

## Appearance and Personality
Telrii is lean and has a strong posture and a stately air. He is bald, and a massive purple birthmark sits across the left side of his face and neck. He might have been handsome, but he wore a plethora of jewelry and garish clothing (often decorated with embroidery or gemstones), making him look pompous.
He is quite a frivolous spender with poor financial sense. He prefers to have servants do his work for him, and enjoys lounging about while surrounded by exotic foods and goods. He is known to be thirsty for power, and people generally assume that money is his largest motivator. However, he is not quite as single minded as he seems. He is unpredictable and just wily enough to conceal his true intentions, although he may not be quite smart enough to understand all of the repercussions of his actions.

## History
The only reason he managed to attain such a high rank of duke and a great amount of personal wealth in the first place is due to inheriting his brother's estate upon the latter's death, his brother having been a much better merchant.
He had one daughter, [[Shaor\|Soine]], who had never grown out any hair and thus he had a blonde wig made for her. When the Shaod took her over two years before Sarene's arrival in Arelon, he covered it up, instead claiming that she had died due to an illness known as [[Dionia\|dionia]].
When Sarene began her incursions into Elantris to hand out food, Telrii joined but made no effort to do any work himself, instead bringing along a manservant.
[[Raoden\|Raoden]] never cared much for Telrii, having once invited him to join his group of conspirators only for Telrii to yawn casually and ask him how much he was willing to pay for his support.
He ascended to the Arelene throne after King [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] death, and conspired with the [[Derethi\|Derethi]] for monetary support in exchange for his support in converting Arelon. However upon taking the throne, Telrii decided to renege on the deal with Hrathen, refusing to officially convert to Shu-Dereth unless made into a gyorn; otherwise he would be under the whims of any Derethi priest, and he knew a gyorn would be considered higher than even a monarch. At that time Count [[Ahan\|Ahan]] made Telrii an offer to betray his fellow conspirators. Telrii led his soldiers to Kiin's house and planned to kill everyone inside, even though he had promised Ahan that he would only imprison them. The soldiers killed [[Roial\|Roial]], but then Raoden, who was believed dead, intervened and caused Telrii and his men to flee.
Telrii was killed by [[Eondel\|Eondel]] just before the [[Invasion of Arelon\|invasion of Arelon]], in retaliation for the death of Roial.
