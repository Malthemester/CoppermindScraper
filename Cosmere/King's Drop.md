## Characteristics
The ruby is the size of a child's head and when infused glows with a blood-red light as bright as daylight. Although it is no larger than a [[Gemheart\|gemheart]] from a [[Greatshell\|greatshell]], it is able to store [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] indefinitely; a normal gem of its size would run out of Stormlight in about a month. Perfect gems maintain their ability to store Stormlight indefinitely if they are brought to [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. Scholars believe that the perfection of the crystal lattice is the reason for these unique properties.
The King's Drop is rumored to be a piece of the [[Stone of Ten Dawns\|Stone of Ten Dawns]], a legendary perfect gemstone.

## History
### Storage
At the end of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the King's Drop was in the custody of the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]]. It had stayed locked inside a closet-sized personal vault within the main vault of the reserve for over 200 years.

### Attempted theft
After severely injuring herself in the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]], Rysn took a job keeping ledgers for [[Queen Fen\|Queen Fen]] with an office in the Gemstone Reserve of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. She was surprised when her former master, [[Vstim\|Vstim]], visited the Reserve for an audit. Vstim and Rysn opened the vault with the King's Drop and regarded it with awe. Suddenly, an assassin disguised as a guard killed [[Tlik\|Tlik]], attacked Vstim, and fought off multiple guards in an attempt to steal the gem. Rysn noticed that the assassin displayed unusual healing and illusory powers.

During the scuffle, Rysn's pet [[Larkin\|larkin]], [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri]], consumed the [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] from the ruby. The assassin was prevented from escaping when Chiri-Chiri drained what appeared to be [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] from his body, preventing the use of his powers and enabling Rysn to kill him with a crossbow. Rysn took the now-dun ruby and tried to determine how she could retrieve the wounded Vstim and exit the vault.

### Battle of Thaylen Field
When [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces attacked [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], a [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]] destroyed the Reserve as it searched for the ruby with several [[Fused\|Fused]]. Although Rysn had already managed to flee with Vstim, [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] saw two more Fused locate their palanquin and steal the ruby. Dalinar realized that the gem must be special, and tasked [[Lift\|Lift]] with retrieving it; [[Szeth\|Szeth]] soon came to help her. After some back-and-forth with the Fused, the duo were able to procure the ruby and Lift delivered it to Dalinar.
Dalinar was able to "lure" and trap [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]], the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] responsible for the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], using the gemstone. The ruby appeared to glow with Voidlight after Nergaoul was imprisoned. After the battle, Dalinar gave the gem to [[Navani\|Navani]] for study. She remarked on the visual similarity to Gavilar's [[Black sphere\|black spheres]].
The gemstone was sunk to the bottom of the ocean afterwards, to prevent the Unmade from being released again.

## Trivia
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

A ruby nicknamed [[Honor's Drop\|Honor's Drop]] is mentioned in the [[Urithiru gem archive\|Urithiru gem archive]] as one of the perfect gems guarded by the [[Order of Elsecallers\|Order of Elsecallers]] of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], presumably during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]]. It has been speculated that the King's Drop is the same ruby in the present day.
