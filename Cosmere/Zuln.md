\-Zuln on a proposed transformation of the listeners to stormform.[1]


**Zuln** is a [[Listener\|listener]] woman who serves on the [[Listener\|listener]] ruling council, the [[Council of Five\|Council of Five]] in their city of [[Narak\|Narak]] in 1173.

## Appearance & Personality
Zuln takes on dullform, and as a result is often quiet. She considers it her duty to represent not only the dullforms, but the slaveforms, or regular [[Parshmen\|parshmen]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. To this end, she wears the smock of a parshman. She also serves as a reminder of the listeners' past.

## History
Zuln agrees to the compromise that allows [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] to take on stormform and report back to the Five on its effects. She dislikes what she saw, and disagrees with the proposed mass transformation of the listeners into stormform, much to Eshonai's rage. When Eshonai takes control of the listeners in her coup, Zuln agrees to take on stormform, but Eshonai does not trust her and has Zuln placed with the others who refuse to take on stormform. Zuln likely escapes with [[Thude\|Thude]] and the rest of the dissenters into the chasms of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
