**Laits** are areas of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that are protected from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] by rock cliffs or outcroppings.

## Characteristics
True laits are not susceptible to rapid erosion and last for many years. Although laits vary widely in size, the rock formations at the top must be at a certain angle to provide effective shelter. [[Crem\|Crem]] buildup may actually increase the effectiveness of a lait. Laits have good drainage that prevent flooding from storms. Flora and fauna tend to be abundant in laits, due to the protection that they provide. Laits all face in the same direction due to the consistent path of highstorms; Kaladin realizes that this strength is actually a weakness in the face of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].

## Use
Many settlements are built in the protection of massive laits, including [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] and [[Bornwater\|Bornwater]]. Laits are desirable places to live, and sometimes attract wealthy residents. Laits have been used as natural shelter for many millenia; the town where [[Heb\|Heb]] and his family lived during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]] was situated in a lait.
Legend holds that Kharbranth's bells were first erected to alert people to the arrival of a highstorm because the city's lait provides such effective shelter. [[Szeth\|Szeth]] remarks that people from eastern Roshar engineer their houses to deflect highstorms out of habit, even within a lait.
The *Fourth Bridge* took shelter in large laits during breaks in its endurance testing over the [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]].

## Trivia
The term "lait" is a transliteration, rather than translation, of the Rosharan name for a place where the storms are blocked. Lait is also presumably used as a transliteration from the [[Listener\|Listener]] language, as [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] uses the same term.
