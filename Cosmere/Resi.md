## History
In 1173, Adolin challenged Resi to a "friendly" duel after Thanadal had criticized [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]. Despite the seemingly low stakes, the dueling arena was full of spectators due to the political implications of the bout. Resi favored [[Stonestance\|Stonestance]], but his relatively slow movements left him open to Adolin's counterattacks using [[Windstance\|Windstance]]. Adolin increased the pressure on Resi, forcing him to take a defensive posture. Resi became unnerved by Adolin's rapid blows, and attempted another heavy strike, but Adolin blocked it with his vambrace and destroyed Resi's thigh plate, leaving him immobile and ending the duel. Resi could be heard swearing audibly after losing.
Resi was one of the many Shardbearers that guarded a meeting of the Highprinces after the [[Assassin in White\|Assassin in White's]] attempt on [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] life.
