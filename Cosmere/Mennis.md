\-Mennis about his role in the skaa rebellion.[1] 

**Mennis** is an elderly [[Skaa\|skaa]] from the [[Tresting plantation\|Tresting plantation]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
He has a bald skull and leathery skin. As one of the oldest workers on the plantation he feels responsible for the skaa there, and that is the only reason he hasn't given up living yet. He had trouble walking on his own and sometimes got assisted by younger men like [[Shum\|Shum]].
When he joined the [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebellion]], he felt like his life had purpose again. Mennis never expected that the rebellion would be able to overthrow the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], resisting the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] was more important for him than actually winning.

## History
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] meets him just before he kills [[Themos Tresting\|Themos Tresting]], but Mennis warns him not to cause too much trouble because he thinks that Kelsier will only make things worse. The next day, after the plantation skaa find out that Kelsier has killed all of Tresting's men, Mennis leads most of them to the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]] where other [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebels]] were already hiding.
Later on, after the remnants of the skaa rebellion have left the caves, Kelsier finds Mennis again in the group of two thousand skaa soldiers that refused to follow [[Yeden\|Yeden]] in the battle against the [[Holstep\|Holstep]] Garrison.
Mennis reveals to Kelsier that he is the one who urged the remaining rebels to be prepared for a sudden departure.
He then advises Kelsier to give up his dreams, because he already accomplished more than the skaa had managed in decades and that was something to be proud of.
