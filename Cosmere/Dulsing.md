## Geography
Dulsing is a remote farming village, isolated from everything. The village is at the foot of the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]] and is close enough to high ground that it contains a small waterfall which has been fitted with a turbine to provide electricity.

## History
Dulsing was once the site of a landmark water rights case that [[Marasi\|Marasi]] read about in one of her textbooks.
Around the year 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship *Brunstell* was searching nearby mountains for the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]] when it ran into bad weather and crashed in Dulsing, killing some of its crewmembers. The villagers were initially helpful to the remaining crew, but the [[Set\|Set]] soon arrived, imprisoned the Southerners, and took over the area. The Set subsequently tore down most of the existing buildings in the village, replacing them with a heavily guarded walled compound, including a large hangar wherein they performed research on various Southern Scadrian items including the *Brunstell*, [[Ettmetal\|ettmetal]], and [[Unsealed metalminds\|unsealed metalminds]]. Professor [[Irich\|Irich]] led the research team, and hoped to make the Set so powerful that they would rule the entire [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]]. Meanwhile, the surviving crew of the *Brunstell* were presumably tortured into revealing the supposed location of the temple and the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]], and most of them (including [[Jordis\|Jordis]]) were later taken into the mountains near the temple site where they nearly froze to death.
After [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores]] had one of ReLuur's [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spikes removed, [[Templeton Fig\|Templeton Fig]] sent the spike to the research center in Dulsing. [[Wayne\|Wayne]] later scared Fig into revealing this location, while [[Wax\|Wax]] also learned that the Set was working on a large building project. The team headed to Dulsing and discovered the Set's compound; [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] found the spike as well as a [[Primer cube\|primer cube]] and [[Allik Neverfar\|Allik Neverfar]]. Wax also found [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]], and the group escaped on the shuttle *Wilg*. The *Brunstell* remained in the Set's possession in Dulsing.

## Trivia
Dulsing is not shown on the Elendel Basin maps in *The Alloy of Law* and *Shadows of Self*. It appears on the map in *The Bands of Mourning*, and its location has been added in [[Nazh\|Nazh's]] handwriting.
