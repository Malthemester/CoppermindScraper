## History
Arsteel joined [[Denth's crew\|Denth's crew]] in the hopes of bringing [[Denth\|Denth]] around and orchestrating a reconciliation between him and [[Vasher\|Vasher]].
Though he was the better swordsman, he was killed in a duel with Vasher several months before the events of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]] in Yarn Dred. Vasher defeated him by suddenly giving him a large quantity of [[Breath\|Breath]]; the arrival of that Breath sent Arsteel into a brief moment of deep pleasure, which distracted him for long enough for Vasher to kill him. He was then made into a [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] named **Clod** by Denth and subsequently looked after by [[Jewels\|Jewels]].
In the middle of an unsuccessful meeting with some Idrian slumlords, Arsteel (as he was Commanded) intervened. Though he was terribly wounded, his nature as Lifeless allowed for Jewels to repair him. After his muscles were sufficiently functional for him to sit up, he attempted to do so, forcing Jewels to Command him to go inactive. In her fear for his life, she slipped up, allowing Vivenna to hear the command phrase--"howl of the sun".
After Vivenna escaped from Vasher, she ran into Denth, Tonk Fah, Jewels, and, of course, Arsteel. Upon seeing the corpses of [[Parlin\|Parlin]] and Tonk Fah's various pets, she realized the group's true nature, and in a desperate bid to escape, Commanded Arsteel to attack Denth, running away in the confusion.

## Abilities and Attributes
>‚Äú*Arsteel was a brilliant duelist‚Äî almost as good as Denth. Vasher's never been able to beat either of them.*‚Äù
\- Jewels about Arsteel[2]


Arsteel is an incredibly skilled swordsman. Since Lifeless retain some of the skills they had in life, and Arsteel was one of the greatest duelists of his time, Clod is a significantly more skilled swordfighter than other Lifeless. Additionally, as a result of the Breaths Vasher gave Arsteel right before killing him, Clod is more self-aware than most Lifeless.

## Relationships
### Jewels
Jewels originally joined [[Denth\|Denth's]] team to be near Arsteel, with whom she was in love. His death 'unhinged' her a little, and after they turned Arsteel's corpse into a [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]], she took over his care and still regularly talked to him, occasionally going so far as to sleep with the Lifeless.

### Denth
Arsteel joined Denth's team because he wanted to try to redeem Denth; he felt that a reconciliation between Denth and [[Vasher\|Vasher]] was possible, and as a peacemaker, he thought he might be able to make it happen.

## Trivia
Brandon has said that the reason Vasher dueled and killed Arsteel might be covered in the [[Nightblood (book)\|Warbreaker sequel]]. It is known from annotations that Arsteel didn‚Äôt set out to duel Vasher intending to kill him, but rather wanted to subdue him and "talk some sense into him." Vasher misinterpreted Arsteel's motives, however, and ended up killing him.
Jewels and Clod may return in the sequel, since they went to see if Yesteel could restore some of Arsteel's memory or personality to his Lifeless form.
