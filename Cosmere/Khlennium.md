\-Alendi's journal.[1]


**Khlennium** was both a city and a kingdom of importance during the [[Classical Scadrial\|classical era]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It was a cosmopolitan hub, and eventually came to be ruled by [[Alendi\|Alendi]]. Its fate after the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of Rashek]] was unclear. However, he appropriated elements of Khlenni culture ‚Äî such as their architecture, fashion and inventions like pocket watches ‚Äî in building the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].

## Geography
During the [[Classical Scadrial\|classical era]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], Khlennium's location was relatively central ‚Äî between the isles in the South and the [[Terris\|Terris]] hills in the North, and between the great nations to the east and the fiery empire of the West. The lands of Khlennium are mostly flat without mountains, and look dreary.

This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

As no further record of Khlennium's existence is given during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], it is possible that the kingdom lay in what became an uninhabitable area after the [[Ascension\|Ascension]] of [[Rashek\|Rashek]] since lands too far south of Scadrial's north pole became too hot to live.

## History
Khlennium was once a city and kingdom of great importance. It eventually came to be ruled by [[Alendi\|Alendi]], possibly by marrying the previous king's daughter as he was presumed to be the [[Hero of Ages\|Hero of Ages]]. During a decade under his leadership, Khlennium united with several nations (including [[Terris\|Terris]]) through both diplomacy and conquest, creating a general force of unity to combat the growing threat of the [[Deepness\|Deepness]].
In an attempt to save Khlennium from the Deepness, Alendi departed on an expedition to the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] in Terris. However, he was killed by [[Rashek\|Rashek]] before reaching it, who then took the Well's power for himself and subsequently changed the planet.
After his Ascension, Rashek, impersonating Alendi, assumed the throne of Khlennium. It is unclear what happened to the kingdom afterwards.

## Culture
The city of Khlennium was regarded as one of ‚Äúwonder‚Äù. It was a cultural hub, with people of many nations, including Terris [[Worldbringers\|Worldbringers]] (such as [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]]).
It had marvelous architecture ‚Äî magnificent cathedrals, stained glass windows, broad halls. Their architectural and civil engineering prowess allowed them to build grand structures and cities, and among its monuments was the great Khlenni library. They also had technological innovations, such as pocket watches, as well as their own language ‚Äî their word for the Hero of Ages was [[Rabzeen\|Rabzeen]].
The Khlenni were viewed as oppressors by the Terris. However, many young Terrismen adopted Khlenni fashion, rather than their furs, while in the cities. Men wore tailored gentlemen‚Äôs suits; ladies wore gowns..
The Khlenni government included a council, of which [[Helenntion\|Helenntion]] was one of its last survivors.
