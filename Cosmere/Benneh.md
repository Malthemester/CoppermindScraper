>“*Brightness! Look here, look here!*”
\-To Navani[1]


**Benneh** is an [[Ardent\|ardent]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
>“*Brother Benneh resembled nothing so much as an eel who had put on robes and grown a pair of arms through sheer determination.*”
\-Navani's observation of Benneh[1]


Benneh is an intelligent, sunny, and spry man. He has an unusually long neck, and the skin under his chin sags. As an ardent, he also has a bald head.

## History
Brother Benneh worked as the head scientist over atmospheric measurements and excitedly reported to [[Navani\|Navani]] in 1175 that temperature and pressure outside of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] rose instead of fell before the advent of [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. He also confirmed that the temperature up on the [[Cloudwalk\|Cloudwalk]] was in fact warmer than down below in the fields. When Navani suggested that perhaps that was only to be expected at high elevations, he referenced a book detailing measurements from trade expeditions to the [[Horneater\|Horneaters]] that disproved such an idea.
