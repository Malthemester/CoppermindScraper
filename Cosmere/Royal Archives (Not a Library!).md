The **Royal Archives (Not a Library!)** is a building in the capital of [[Nalhalla\|Nalhalla]] that houses a huge mountain of books collected by [[Free Kingdoms\|Free Kingdoms]] scribes. Due to its similarity to a library and Free Kingdomers' loathing of libraries, whenever it is mentioned, "not a library" always follows.
Prior to [[Alcatraz\|Alcatraz's]] arrival, the Royal Archives (Not a Library!) featured a disorganized heap of books. This mess frustrated Alcatraz and he had [[Himalaya\|Himalaya]] organize the books.
The Royal Archives (Not a Library!) is protected by [[Silimatic\|Defender's Glass]], so instead of tunneling inside, [[Shasta Smedry\|Shasta]] placed [[Transporter's Glass\|Transporter's Glass]] around it, essentially stealing the whole Archive to grab a book written in the [[Forgotten Language\|Forgotten Language]]. Containing the lost knowledge of Smedry Talents and their origins, the book is extremely important -- and was in fact the book [[Attica Smedry\|Attica]] needed to discover how to give Smedry Talents to everyone.
