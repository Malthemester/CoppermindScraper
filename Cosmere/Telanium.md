**Telanium** is a super-light metal with a silvery texture that is very resistant to corrosion. It is an extremely versatile and strong material, to the point where most modern weaponry has difficulty even scarring it, though [[Mindblade\|mindblades]] can easily destroy it.
[[Evensong\|Evensong]] is made entirely out of telanium.
