## Attributes and Abilities

## History
Lukel is [[Daora\|Daora]]´s son from a previous marriage. He and his full brother [[Adien\|Adien]] were adopted by Kiin who takes full parental responsibility.
He studied at [[Svordish University\|Svordish University]], where he met his future wife [[Jalla\|Jalla]].
He was part of Raoden’s group who opposed the King and his policies. After Raoden’s supposed death, he continued to participate in the meetings, but was disappointed to see a low participation rate . He shared this information with Sarene, who asked to join the meetings. He helped her have a seat in the meetings where he participated and suggested caution. He agreed with moving forward with planning.
Lukel decided to see [[Sarene\|Sarene]]´s fencing lesson to the women of the court. As always, he teased her, but was an encouraging support for her.
As part of the plans for changing [[Iadon\|Iadon]]’s policies, he follows closely the king’s income figures. He is the one to confirm that it was due to his earnings in Teod and some taxes that he barely made it. The plan was to have both countries allied and resist the [[Gyorn\|gyorn]] named [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] who wanted to convert all Arelon´s people to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]].
He continues with the group’s planning even after Iadon’s death, Sarene’s illness and unexplained recuperation, and the appointment of Telrii as the new king.
When Raoden came back into Arelon, he immediately kneeled and recognized him as the legitimate king and accepted the plan to do the same in public.
Daora and the children huddled in the basement under Lukel’s care when Dilaf first attacked. They were later herded with the rest of the Arelenes from Kae into Elantris to be burned to death. At first he didn’t resist, hugging his family and knowing the were being taken to their death.
As [[Shuden\|Shuden]] started his dance to fight, he took the leg of a table and hit his foe. He managed to fight and stay alive by running and hiding much. His aid came from [[Sarene\|Sarene]]´s fencing students. Still after some time, one of the soldiers hit a long gash on his thigh and didn’t bother to finish him off. Jalla pulled him in with the other captives and tried to stop the blood. Lukel was feeling hopeless when Raoden managed to restore Elantris. As soon as he noticed and realized it was true, he fainted. He was healed by Raoden after the fight ended.
In this fight, the regular guy surrounded by mages, heroes, and politicians gets to be a bit of a hero himself.

## Relationships
### Raoden
He's good friends with [[Raoden\|Raoden]], and considered him his best friend. Upon becoming Elantrian, Raoden lamented the fact he wouldn't get to know Lukel's wife or children.
On the other side, Lukel referred to Raoden as “The greatest man I have ever known.”

### Sarene
Lukel and Sarene become fond of each other fast. He enjoys teasing her including talking about her painting talents. 
He was one of the first to explain politics in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] to [[Sarene\|Sarene]]; for example how lands were taken and servants were very close to becoming property or how [[Iadon\|Iadon]] got the throne. He got her into the meeting with Raoden’s most loyal followers. 

### Jalla
He met his Svordish wife [[Jalla\|Jalla]] at school and married her a month before Sarene’s arrival to Arelon.
She is a fierce bargainer and helps Lukel with his trades. He does acknowledge her as brilliant and beautiful.
He asked her to bargain when they were sent to Elantris claiming her Svordish blood, but she refused to leave them behind.

## Quotes

\-Lukel to Sarene on her yelling to Iadon[16]


>“*You know, you could have left a scar. I had to go through an awful lot to get that wound—you should have seen how courageous I was. My grandchildren are going to be disappointed that I don’t have any scars to show them.*”
\-Lukel to Raoden after he healed his leg wound[13]


## Trivia
Lukel doesn't really have much part in the plot, but he's always there to throw in a nice quip or two.
Lukel isn't there simply to entertain the reader, he's there to show a different side of human reaction.
