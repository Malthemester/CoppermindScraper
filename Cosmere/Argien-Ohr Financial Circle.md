The **Argien-Ohr Financial Circle** is the largest and most prestigious committee of bankers in [[Elendel\|Elendel]].

## History
After [[Paalm\|Paalm]] broke a dam causing the flooding of [[Corbeau\|Corbeau]] the Circle convened an emergency meeting to discuss sending aid to the ravaged region. They discussed whether or not their investment would be enough to stave off the economic disaster of the region's grain production being reduced by half for the year. Lord [[Chapmot Heviers\|Chapmot Heviers]] told *The House Record* that while they had enough supplies in reserve to last four months, afterwards grain would start going to the highest bidder. He predicted that bakers would start producing whiskey instead of bread as there was a larger profit to be made that way.
