>“*The invented story of the Survivor himself bleeding from his spear wound and stopping here to drink made sense.*”
\-Jak on the Survivor's treasure[1]


The **Survivor's Treasure** is a cache told of in stories on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
According to legend, the treasure is located where the [[Survivor\|Survivor]] stopped to drink after the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] stabbed him with a spear. It is said that it is hidden opposite the sky and can be raised only by life itself. [[Mikaff\|Mikaff's]] dying wish was to find this treasure.
During his adventures in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], Allomancer [[Jak\|Jak]] encountered and recovered a box located 18.3 fathoms deep in the waters of the [[Pits of Eltania\|Pits of Eltania]] that matched stories about the Suvivor's Treasure. According to his account, the box had a latch on it that released what appeared to be a bladder, which he then blew air from his lungs into to lift the treasure to the surface. This account is likely exaggerated and some of the details have been contested by his editor [[Handerwym\|Handerwym]]. The box recovered by Jak was made of pure [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] and contained several [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spikes suitable for making [[Koloss\|koloss]].
