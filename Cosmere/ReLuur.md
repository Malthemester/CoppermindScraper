**ReLuur** is a third generation [[Kandra\|kandra]]. There are very few third generation kandras, and many kandra looked up to him. 
He is an explorer and pursues knowledge of the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]]. Along the way, he took many evanotypes of murals and images that depicted the Bands of Mourning, suggesting that they did in fact exist. However, when he returned to the Kandra [[Homeland\|Homeland]], he was missing one of his two [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic spikes]], and as a result was not entirely sane. [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] attempted to give ReLuur one of his spikes, but as it was another kandra's spike, he rejected it and spat it out.
He found the [[Set\|Set]] and [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]].
ReLuur's spike is pewter, a metal which is not normally used as a [[Blessing\|Blessing]].
