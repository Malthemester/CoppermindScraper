## Capital
Before the [[Reod\|Reod]] the capital city of Arelon was Elantris, the magical shining city home to the Elantrians who ruled the nation. After the fall of Elantris the nearby city of [[Kae\|Kae]] became the capital for a short period of ten years and then after the invasion of Arelon, and the reconstruction of Elantris, New Elantris became the new capital.

## Government
Before the Reod, Arelon was ruled as a theocratic nation, ruled by the Elantrians, who were worshipped as deities by virtue of their magical abilities. Although the Elantrians were regarded as gods by many of the citizenry other religions existed and were not contested by the Elantrians.
After the collapse of Elantris due to the Reod, the merchant class rose up as the most powerful and wealthy citizens, and overthrew the former government. The merchants then became the new nobility, the capital city moved from Elantris to one of the surrounding towns, [[Kae\|Kae]], and the head of the merchants guild [[Iadon\|Iadon]] was crowned as king, the new government ruled that someones nobility was directly tied to their wealth, which lead to the reinstatement of a form of slavery of the peasant class as all the nobles struggled to gain more wealth and so rise in rank. In addition to barons, counts, and dukes, the system also had lesser titles like Kimeon (and its feminine version, Kimess) and Tore. This system of government was incredibly unstable and it is believed that even without the [[Invasion of Arelon\|invasion of Arelon]] the government would soon have collapsed.
After assuming the the throne, King [[Raoden\|Raoden]] made the nobility lords of Elantris and charged them with distributing food and seeing to the needs of remote places.

The currency used in Arelon is the Deo. It is named after Aon Deo.

## Magic
Some people of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] heritage, residing in Arelon would be struck by a phenomenon known as the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] and would gain the ability to draw [[Aon\|Aons]], which when drawn correctly, could produce a magical effect. These symbols were strongest when used close to the city of Elantris and inside of Arelons borders. Each Aon also resembled some of the landscape of Arelon. The central Aon that was required to draw all others was a basic map of Arelon itself.

## Plantations
After the [[Reod\|Reod]] and the Fall of Elantris, King [[Iadon\|Iadon]] established a plantation system in order to control Arelon. Peasants were bound to a plantation in a practice similar to serfdom. Each plantation was named for a different Aon. Due to the competitive nature of Arelene noble status, the peasants were often poorly treated, as the nobles were anxious to retain their titles.

## Trivia
In the first published edition of *Elantris*, the term "Arelish" was used to describe things originating from the nation of Arelon. This was changed in the tenth anniversary edition of *Elantris* such that "Arelene" is now used as the nation's demonym and adjectival form.
