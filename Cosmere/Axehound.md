## Appearance and Anatomy

For more images, see [[Axehound/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Axehounds are hexapedal creatures with a smooth hide that is a cross between skin and carapace. It is more flexible than true carapace, but, like carapace, is formed of interlocking sections. They have a fluting fish-like tail. Axehounds have a pair of feather-like antennae positioned on the top of their heads which they can move as a form of communication. They have ear holes slightly further back on the sides of their heads. Axehounds have a main jaw as well as a pair of outer mandibles that they use to break into the shells of their prey. Their blood is violet.
There are a wide variety of breeds of axehounds. The largest come up to a man's waist while the smallest can easily hide in the underbrush of a lait. Smaller breeds of axehounds tend to be very fast.
Axehounds have very small gemhearts.

## Behavior
 by  EccoS 
Wild axehounds are social creatures who live and hunt in groups. Female axehounds are attentive mothers who actively protect their pups.
Axehounds are predators willing to prey on everything from [[Songling\|songlings]] to hogs.
The axehound call consists of two voices that overlap and echo with one another and is referred to as "trumping". When an axehound is content, their trumping can sound like a hum, but when angered or in pain, it is more of a bellow.

## History
Axehounds are kept and bred as pets across Roshar, though different breeds are popular in different regions.
Axehound fighting and the accompanying betting culture is popular in some areas. There are axehound fights at the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] that the [[House Davar\|Davar family]] attends in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. Axehounds are also involved in organized hunts.
