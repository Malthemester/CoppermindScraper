**Graspers** are small creatures native to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Graspers are tentacled predators that live in the bottom of small holes in the rock. They prey on [[Cremling\|cremlings]], snatching those nearby with their tentacles and pulling them into their lairs. This appears to be especially common after [[Highstorm\|highstorms]], as the cremlings drink water out of pools that form in the same holes that serve as lairs for graspers. They are not the only animals on the Shattered Plains that employ this method of predation.
