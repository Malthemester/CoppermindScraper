For more information, see [[Curators of Alexandria\|Curators of Alexandria]].
The library is protected by a curse wherein anyone who reads from or moves a book forfeits their soul and becomes one of the library's curators.
The Curators try to get visitors to check out a book so that they can claim their soul. The library is laid out so that one will get hopelessly lost, making a visitor just give up. Traps are everywhere as well, with the information on how to get out of them written on books that can be checked out.
