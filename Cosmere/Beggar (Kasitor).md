\-The beggar "banishes" Axies[1]

[[Axies the Collector\|Axies the Collector]] briefly interacts with **a beggar** in [[Kasitor\|Kasitor]]. The beggar lives in an alley, which he claims is the finest in Kasitor, among trash and rotting vegetables.

## Appearance and Personality
He is described as a "scraggly-bearded man" who is missing teeth and wearing a [[Lavis\|lavis]] sack. This eccentric man arranges rotting vegetables into a miniature map of a city and acts as a sort of deity to his miniature city, remarking that some of his imaginary citizens had been bad lately.

## History
After spending a night researching [[Alespren\|alespren]], Axies was assaulted and left for dead in the beggar's alley. The beggar woke the naked [[Aimian\|Aimian]] in the morning and demanded a rent payment. He also accused Axies of destroying "the temple of the northern god," "half of Hapron Street," a bakery, and several homes when he fell on the piles of trash. He then asked Axies if he is a "[[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] or a [[Herald\|Herald]]?" Axies tricked the suspicious beggar into giving him a blanket for clothing by hinting that the "sacred cloth" would banish him from the alley.
