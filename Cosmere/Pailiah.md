## Abilities
 by  Esther Schrader 
For more information about Heraldic powers, see Herald#Abilities.
The cultural references to Pailiah imply that she might've been a scholar prior to becoming a Herald. As a Herald, she's an immortal [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]], and every time she dies, she travels to [[Braize\|Braize]]. There, she's tortured until she or one of the other Heralds breaks, returning them to Roshar.
When Pailiah wielded her [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], she had use of the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Illumination\|Illumination]], allowing her to create illusions of light and sound, and [[Progression\|Progression]], letting her grow plants and heal herself and others. She also had the ability to breathe in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], compounding her self-healing power. However, she has abandoned her Blade at the Aharietiam, losing her access to Stormlight and Surgebinding. Whether she has Surgebinding abilities in the present day is uncertain.

## History
 by  Shuravf 
Like most other Heralds, Pailiah was born on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] and made the trip to [[Roshar\|Roshar]] when the former was destroyed by a man-made catastrophe. She was likely a scholar of some sortâ€”at the very least, she was an important figure in early Rosharan society. When the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] began, she was one of the ten people made Heralds by [[Honor\|Honor]] and given a [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]].
Along with all of the Heralds but [[Taln\|Taln]], Pailiah abandoned the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] at the end of [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]]. At some point, she may have joined the [[Ardentia\|Ardentia]] and in particular, the [[Devotary of Insight\|Devotary of Insight]], who act as caretakers for the [[Palanaeum\|Palanaeum]] in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. It is unclear if she was involved with Taravangian during this time, and Pailiah may have briefly crossed paths with [[Shallan\|Shallan]] while the young scholar was studying under [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]].

## Culture
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]]
In the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] culture, Pailiah is associated with number 5 (Palah), the essence Pulp, and the attributes of Learned and Giving. The grand library in Kharbranth, [[Palanaeum\|Palanaeum]], is named after her.
Pailiah features in several Rosharan idioms, such as "Pali's mind" and "Pailiah knew...", referencing her nature as Learned. There are temples to her in major cities on Roshar, like [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] and [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen]].

## Trivia
Under [[Vorin\|Vorin]] rules, where "h" can stand for any letter, Pailiah is a symmetrical name, making her one of the only three Heralds, alongside [[Shalash\|Shalash]] and [[Kalak\|Kalak]], whose names weren't altered by the Vorin culture (although Kalak became Kelek due to linguistic drift).
Early on, Brandon readily confirmed that the old ardent in the Palanaeum is Pailiah. Later, however, when questioned about it, he was a lot more ambiguous.
Pailiah's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the Scholar by the [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] staff.
