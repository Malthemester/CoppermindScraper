>“*Other methods must exist, as proven by the extremely large gemstone fabrials created by the Vriztl Guild out of Thaylenah.*”
\-A quote from Navani's lecture on fabrial mechanics[1]


The **Vriztl Guild** is a secretive guild of [[Artifabrian\|artifabrians]] based out of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
During the [[Singer\|singer]] occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] [[Ulvlk\|Ulvlk]], a member of the guild, told [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] that they use sound to transfer [[Light\|Light]] between gems. This knowledge was passed down via tradition for centuries. [[Vrandl\|Vrandl]] believed that [[Ulvlk\|Ulvlk]] would be expelled by the guild for revealing this secret to the [[Alethi\|Alethi]].
