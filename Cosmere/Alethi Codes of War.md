## History
### Origin
It is not clear who created or documented the Codes. The Alethi king [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] says that they are from "the old days" when "Alethkar meant something"  and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] says that they are a relic of "old Alethkar". However, Alethkar's predecessor, the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Alethela\|Alethela]], is sometimes referred to as "Alethkar" by modern Alethi, obscuring the provenance of the Codes.
At some point, the Codes fell into disuse, and they have not been followed for centuries. Dalinar's embrace of the Codes seems to be a major step in his journey to become a [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]], but it is not clear if there were ancient Radiants in Alethkar who followed the Codes prior to the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]].

### Gavilar's Discovery
>“*Brother, follow the Codes tonight. There is something strange upon the winds.*”
\-Gavilar's last words to Dalinar[2]


Gavilar somehow rediscovers the Codes towards the end of his rule. He first mentions them to his brother Dalinar at the feast where [[Evi\|Evi]] is introduced. Gavilar was taken by the Codes and reintroduced their use, but his [[Highprince\|Highprinces]], including [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] and Dalinar, dismissed them as foolish. [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] and others saw Gavilar's emphasis on the Codes as a symptom of a possible decline in his mental health.

### Dalinar's Adoption
Dalinar is drunk when [[Assassination of Gavilar\|Gavilar is assassinated]] and he realizes that he may have been able to help if he had been following the Codes, which prohibit alcohol. At Gavilar's funeral, Dalinar thinks about the Codes and his failures; he later listens to [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] read passages from *The Way of Kings*, and reaches a turning point in his life. Dalinar and his children begin strictly adhering to the Codes. Dalinar believes that the Codes help him manage the extreme parts of his personality that he cannot otherwise control.

>“*We follow the Codes not because they bring gain, but because we loathe the people we would otherwise become. We stand here on this battlefield alone because of who we are.*”
\-Dalinar, preparing himself and the Cobalt Guard for death at the Battle of the Tower[11]


Dalinar believes that the Alethi leadership is not staying prepared and vigilant during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. His adherence to the Codes causes friction with the other [[Highprince\|highprinces]], including Sadeas, who tells Dalinar that his honor is going to get him killed. Like Gavilar before him, other Alethi elites (including [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] and [[Adolin\|Adolin]]) begin to question Dalinar's sanity, with the Codes and [[Dalinar's visions\|his visions]] among their causes for concern.
Adolin is sometimes frustrated by his father's interpretation of the Codes of War, even as Dalinar's resolve to follow them continues to grow. Adolin does not like wearing his [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] in low-risk situations and he wishes that he could challenge more people to duels. He eventually realizes that the Codes remind soldiers and society at large that they are at war, and that following them inspires confidence in the military.

>“*Never ask of your men a sacrifice you wouldn’t make yourself. Never make them fight in conditions you would refuse to fight in yourself. Never ask a man to perform an act you wouldn’t soil your own hands doing.*”
\-Dalinar's interpretation of the "Leadership" Code[15]


After Dalinar survives the Battle of the Tower and is made [[Highprince of War\|Highprince of War]], he decides to enforce the Codes in all of the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. This is met with immediate resistance, but Dalinar plans to increase his authority by having Adolin duel and win [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] or Shardplate from other armies if they do not comply with his directive.
