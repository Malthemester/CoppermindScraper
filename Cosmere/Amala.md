**Amala** was an [[Epic\|Epic]] and an acquaintance of [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Jonathan Phaedrus]] and [[Tia\|Tia]].
She was married to [[Dean Knighthawk\|Dean Knighthawk]]. After her Epic powers manifested, she joined a team of would-be superheroes along with [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Jonathan Phaedrus]], [[Abigail Reed\|Abigail Reed]], and [[Lincoln\|Lincoln]]. She eventually succumbed to [[Calamity\|Calamity's]] corruption and was subsequently killed by Phaedrus. Her husband kept her body in stasis and repeatedly attempted to revive her using various Epic-derived healing technology, but he was unsuccessful. Some time after Calamity was defeated, she was finally revived, possibly by Phaedrus' healing power, though the complete story is somewhat complicated.
It is unknown what powers Amala had or what her weakness was.
