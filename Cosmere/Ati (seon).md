**Ati** is a [[Seon\|seon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]] who is bonded with [[Dashe\|Dashe]]. They are named after Aon Ati, which means hope.
Ati was bonded with an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] at the time of the [[Reod\|Reod]] and therefore lost their sapience until the restoration of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]]. By that point, the person they had been bonded with was dead, so they approached [[Raoden\|Raoden]] to ask for a new master. Raoden gave them, as well as the seon [[Aeo\|Aeo]], to [[Dashe\|Dashe]], who bonded with Ati and gave Aeo to [[Matisse\|Matisse]].
