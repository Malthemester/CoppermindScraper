## Geography and Ecology
In the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Babatharnam was a part of [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]]. Babatharnam borders the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], [[Yulay\|Yulay]], [[Marabethia\|Marabethia]], and [[Rira (country)\|Rira]]. Cities in Babatharnam include its capital of [[Panatham\|Panatham]] and [[Sween\|Sween]].
Babatharnam has peculiar trees which, when a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] approaches, completely lay down, trunk and all, as if the tree was on a hinge. The Babath are human-[[Aimian\|Aimian]] hybrids.

## History
During the initial months of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the Most Ancient of Babatharnam refused to cooperate with [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. The nation was conquered by [[Singer\|singer]] forces shortly after the capitulation of Iri.

## Politics
In Babatharnam, the older one is, the more authority one has. Everyone has an opportunity to rule, if they live long enough. Anyone can become the **Most Ancient**--the Babath king.
However, in practicality, during the present day, Babatharnam is ruled by the **Monavakah Dynasty**, which executes or exiles any person old enough to challenge them. This has ensured that the Monavakahs have remained in power for fifty years. [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] has visited Babatharnam, and recalled that the nation has a great deal of unrest from the Monavakah Dynasty's assassinations.

## Culture
The Babath are very particular to how one speaks and can be offended easily. Sigzil has managed to be imprisoned three times in Babatharnam, though he suspects the Babath use any excuse to imprison a foreigner, as his [[Hoid\|master]] had a good deal of money.
