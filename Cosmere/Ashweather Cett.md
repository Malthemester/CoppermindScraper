## Appearance and Personality
Cett is abrasive and takes delight in being purposefully rude. He also tends to use this to throw guests off balance, allowing him to have more control over the situation; when he meets with [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]], Cett deliberately serves messy food to make Elend uncomfortable.

## History
After the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] death and the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], he quickly takes control of the [[Western Dominance\|Western Dominance]] but is unable to keep control of [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]]. Cett ended up in a struggle for power white [[Aradan Yomen\|Aradan Yomen]], an [[Obligator\|obligator]] in the city. At some point Cett lost 2,000 soldiers in a battle against 500 [[Koloss\|koloss]]. After one year it began to become clear that Yomen would be the one to take control. Cett blamed his disadvantage on a lack of Allomancers (he only had 9). He was manipulated by [[Breeze\|Breeze]] who convinced him that the Lord Rulers [[Atium cache\|atium cache]] was in Luthadel and that he could use the atium to buy Allomancers. He decided to lay siege on [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] with an army of 40,000 soldiers to take the Central Dominance and the atium from [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]].. Before his army arrived he sent 4 Pewterarms, a Smoker, a Lurcher, a Coinshot and a Mistborn with atium to kill Vin. The assassins failed and were killed, but made Vin use up her last atium.
In the [[Siege of Luthadel\|Siege of Luthadel]], Cett's Army was outnumbered by [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture's]] forces of 50,000. Realizing this, he secretly entered Luthadel and presented himself to [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] at a [[Luthadel Assembly\|Luthadel Assembly]] meeting, proposing that his troops enter the city and the pair ally against Straff. However, when Elend is attacked by Mistings, [[Vin\|Vin]] believes these to be agents of Cett after recognizing one Thug supposedly as a servant of Cett. Vin and [[Zane Venture\|Zane Venture]] then enter [[Keep Hasting\|Keep Hasting]], killing Cett's soldiers and almost killing Cett himself--Vin suspected him to be a Mistborn, although he was not. Cett then leaves the city with his troops.
After the siege, Vin forces Cett to pledge allegiance to Elend and Cett becomes a general in the new Emperor's army. He takes part in the [[Siege of Fadrex City\|Siege of Fadrex City]].
During the siege he is glad to see that [[Elend\|Elend]] has finally agreed to take back his own capital from Yomen. He helps to direct and manage the army. According to [[Elend\|Elend]], if should something happen to him, Cett would be third in line to take command of his empire, after [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Sazed\|Sazed]], respectively.
During the planning of the siege, Cett puts forward some of the more brutal but effective ideas, such as sending parts of the army out to attack undefended small villages in order to force Yomen to play his hand, as well as simply assassinating him and taking control. [[Elend\|Elend]] also requests that he drafts up a list of [[Noble\|noblemen]] and informants inside the city who could possibly aid them with information or perhaps acting as double-agents within the city. He thus gives [[Vin\|Vin]] information on how to find and contact [[Slowswift\|Slowswift]] as well as [[Hoid\|Hoid]] inside the city.
During the battle against the [[Koloss\|koloss]] at [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]], Cett stays behind the fighting and commands tactics while [[Elend\|Elend]] goes out to help wherever his soldiers are having trouble with the koloss brutes.
As part of the [[Catacendre\|Final Ascension]] Sazed repairs all genetic defects and physical ailments in the people who were in the storage caches. This includes Cett, giving him the ability to walk once more. He is so shocked by this that he spends the entire epilogue walking around in the cavern, marveling.

## Relationships
He is the head of [[House Cett\|House Cett]] and sired both [[Allrianne Cett\|Allrianne]] and [[Gneorndin Cett\|Gneorndin Cett]].
