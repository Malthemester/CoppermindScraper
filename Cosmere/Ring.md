## Composition and Purpose
The Ring consists of multiple members, as [[Wyndle\|Wyndle]] refers to it as "they". They view the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic's]] touch on [[Lift\|Lift]] as a blessing from their "mother", the same term that Wyndle uses for the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. The usual purpose of the Ring is not clear, but they appear to have authority among cultivationspren, as Wyndle was compelled to take an assignment at their request.

## History
The cultivationspren decided to start trying to form new [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] after other [[Spren\|spren]] such as the [[Cryptic\|Cryptics]] and the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] started to do so. As they were not sure how exactly to accomplish this due to the length of time since the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], the Ring served as a committee that oversaw the process.

### Wyndle's Assignment
Wyndle was happily living in Shadesmar when the Ring chose him to try and form a Nahel bond with someone in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. He was not happy about his mission and referred to it as an "atrocious duty". The Ring was additionally responsible for the specific choice of [[Lift\|Lift]] as a bond partner for Wyndle, a choice that he did not agree with. However, the Ring viewed Lift's youth and her experience with the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]] as positive traits in a candidate. Wyndle found that bonding with Lift was easier than expected and speculated that the Old Magic had caused her to exist partially in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. Wyndle later accepted the fact that he had needed to be sent on an assignment.
