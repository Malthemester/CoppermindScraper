**Marewill flowers** are a type of flowers that existed on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] before and after the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. Marewill flowers are blue-white colored.

## Mare's flower
After the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]], the world had no flowers. However, [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] wife, [[Mare\|Mare]], was fascinated by pre-Ascension times, and collected pictures of the old era. She held a piece of paper that had an image of a flower on it, which both perplexed Kelsier and [[Vin\|Vin]], who had never seen the strange plants.
Mare died and Kelsier kept the paper with the flower and used it as a symbol of hope.

>“*I decided that I’d see her dream fulﬁlled. I’d make a world where ﬂowers returned, a world with green plants, a world where no soot fell from the sky...." He trailed off, then sighed. "I know. I’m insane.*”
\-Kelsier to Vin, after showing her the picture of a Marewill flower.[2]


Later, after Kelsier's death, the picture of the flower was passed onto Vin.
During the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]], [[Sazed\|Sazed]] used the image of the flower, along with other [[Larsta\|Larsta]] descriptions of the plants, to help restore the world from the damage of the Lord Ruler. He left the original image of Mare's flower to [[Spook\|Spook]] in one of his books, which would later be called the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]].

## After the Final Ascension
Marewill flowers were located in the [[Field of Rebirth\|Field of Rebirth]], on a hill leading to the statues and tombs of the [[Elend Venture\|Last Emperor]] and the [[Vin\|Ascendant Warrior]].
