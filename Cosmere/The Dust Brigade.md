*The Dust Brigade* is a tentative title for a [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] novel set on [[Threnody\|Threnody]]. The novel is considered one that Brandon will "maybe" write someday, although he does consider it integral to the overall [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] sequence. The novel is planned to take place on the [[Homeland\|Homeland]] towards the end of the cosmere timeline.

## Plot Summary
An expedition tries to go back to the [[Homeland\|Homeland]] and free it from the [[Evil\|Evil]] but things don't go well for them - the book starts with their ships sinking and the people washing up on shore.
The [[Deepest One\|Deepest Ones]] will be "involved a great deal."

## Characters
The story will be about brand new characters, and will most likely not include [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]] - except possibly as a minor cameo.

## Setting
The story takes place on Threnody, likely on the Homeland, the former home of the [[Forescout\|Forescouts]] that was lost to the [[Evil\|Evil]]. It will be the closest Brandon has ever gotten to grimdark.

## Development
*The Dust Brigade* has been a part of Brandon's original plan for the cosmere saga for many years, since before he was a published author. The original idea for the story involved a group of refugees arriving in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] after having fled the Homeland, now destroyed by the Evil. Recent years have seen Brandon grow more confident in his idea to flip the story on its head and instead focus on people attempting to take back the Homeland. He has not yet fully completed an outline for the book.

## Trivia
One of the reasons Brandon wants to write this book is because there is "a group" that will be important later in the cosmere saga, and he needs to write a book about them so that readers know who they are.
