**High Imperial**, known before the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]] of Harmony as Eastern street slang, is a dialect on Scadrial used by [[Spook\|Spook]] and his childhood friends. After the ascension of Harmony, High Imperial turned into a scholarly, formal language that was rarely used outside of important legal documents.

>“* One thing about High Imperial, or Eastern Street Slang, is that it was devised by those who spoke it in order to be intentionally obtuse. So it was hard for people to understand. And so there are a lot of nonsense words thrown in the middle. But, it's also got reversed grammar. 'Wasing the wanting of doing the thing' is 'I wanted to do that.' But you can also throw random words in there. As long as those parts are in there, it'll make sense to those they're speaking to. 'I wanted to do this. Wasing the wanting of doing the thing.' You're putting everything into a gerund. You're starting with the verb and the tense. And you're turning everything into ridiculously bad gerunds. That's it in brief.*”
\- Brandon Sanderson on making sense of High Imperial[2]

"Wasing the how of wanting the doing.
But that's the best part, Beldre said. "It's gibberish on purpose, right?"
Spook remembered with fondness how his parents had responded to his adoption of the slang. It had been a kind of power, being able to say things that only his friends could understand. Of course, he'd started speaking in it so much that it had been hard to switch back.


## How To Speak
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

The **pronoun** is assumed to be you unless contradicted.
Using your name is redundant.
If you must refer to the subject do so at **the end**.
Use **nicknames for people**, the language is based off moving the structure of a sentence into as many *confusing manners* as possible. In fact, using a **nickname of a nickname** is best. For example, Spook uses the nickname Nip to refer to Breeze, which is in itself a nickname.
*Adjectives* come **first**, Then *verbs*, even if you form them as nouns
In general, **verbs should be gerunds**, meaning they should end with *-ing*, even if that's not normally correct.
The only exception is if the verb can't become a gerund without losing the needed meaning.
Form sentences *(Tense-Adjective) (Verb-Gerund) Noun*
The longer the sentence is it becomes **symmetrical**.
Remember it **TAV-GuN; Nug VAT** Those in parenthesis (see above) *can be swapped* around with each other.
I don't know where the you came from; this is how a friend explained it to me.
It's better to use **longer sentences**, the shorter ones can give more **clarity, which we are trying to avoid. Throw as many "wasings" and "hasings" in as possible, even if they are not necessary to divert from the actual point**
**Don't use possessives** unless they are formed as *adjectives*.
To refer to a subject say **"of <subject name>"**.
Many phrases begin with **Wasing** or **Ising**.
**Ising (in the) now** is incorrect, don't pair them. This *changes* the tense.
If you must change the tense, you'll have to cycle again, or you risk adding too much clarity to what you say.
Don't neglect **Notting, Nowing, Nearing, Having, Kind, Good, You, He, Wanting** and other words as they work well too.
Remember that you'll learn to understand it before you speak it near as well.

## Trivia
The dialect's grammatical rules are intentionally vague.
High Imperial was inspired by a person Brandon knew from the [[Timewasters Guide\|Timewasters Guide]] forums, who sometimes posted random gibberish that, upon close inspection, turned out to be rather poetic.
