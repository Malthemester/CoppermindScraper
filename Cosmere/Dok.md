**Dok** is an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] sailor on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. At the order of Queen [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], he and many other Alethi enlist to serve on [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] ships to learn sailing traditions. [[Yalb\|Yalb]] notes that Dok is a competent sailor compared to most other Alethi, although he occasionally got seasick.
In late 1174, he joined the crew of Captain [[Smta\|Smta]]. After Yalb took him under his wing, Dok was victim to a prank commonly played on new sailors as a hazing ritual. First, he was tricked into pretending to see a nonexistent "sailorspren" to win a small bet. Yalb expected Dok to "see" more sailorspren and eventually place a larger bet that he could catch one, resulting in Dok losing his [[Sphere\|spheres]] to Yalb. Before the prank could continue, Yalb spotted the ship *First Dreams* on the horizon.
