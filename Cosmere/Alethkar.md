**Alethkar** is the largest and most prominent of the five [[Vorinism\|Vorin]] nations on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. People from Alethkar are known as **Alethi**, and their royal colors are blue and gold. The [[Singer\|singers]] name for Alethkar is **Avendla**, meaning Land of the Second Advance. Prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], they were engaged in the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] against the [[Listeners\|listeners]]. At the present, the vast majority of their territory is under control of the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]].

## Geography
 by  Isaac Stewart  Map of Alethkar. Alethi territories (barring the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]) are marked in purple.
### Borders and Territories
Alethkar lies in eastern [[Roshar\|Roshar]], stretching across the entire continent, from the [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]] in the North to the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]] in the South-West. To the East, it leans on the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]], while to the South, it reaches the nationless [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] and the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], the latter of which it has recently claimed for itself. In the West, Alethkar has a long and long-disputed border with [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], which currently follows two rivers and the bend of the [[Sunmaker Mountains\|Sunmaker Mountains]]. In North-West, Alethkar borders [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]] across a stretch of land decided through a few years of border wars.
Besides the mainland, the Alethi have a number of territories off the coast. On the [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]], Alethkar has [[Akak\|Akak]] and a number of surrounding islands, giving it complete control over the [[Bay of Elibath\|Bay of Elibath]]. On the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]] - more specifically, a region of it called [[Mevan Bay\|Mevan Bay]] - it controls a number of small islands in the delta of [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend River]], near the city of [[Karanak\|Karanak]].

### Interior
At the tail end of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], Alethkar is the largest state on Roshar, covering around seven million square kilometers of land. Despite the fact that it is far more exposed to the [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] than any country further West, large swathes of it are lush with animals and vegetation. It has numerous rivers crossing it, the two major ones being [[Windrunner River\|Windrunner]] and [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend]]. The Windrunner River runs East to West, from Unclaimed Hills to the Bay of Elibath, and has numerous tributaries across the northern half of the country. The Deathbend River likewise starts in the Unclaimed Hills, though it turns South, ultimately ending in the Mevan Bay, with one of its major tributaries being an enormous lake called the [[Sea of Spears\|Sea of Spears]]. The North and South of Alethkar are divided by a long, cross-shaped masiff called the [[Sunmaker Mountains\|Sunmaker Mountains]].

### Notable cities
[[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] - the seat of [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] and the national capital following Alethkar's unification. The [[Alethela\|Alethela]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] is located there.
[[Rathalas\|Rathalas]] - ruined city once known for being constructed in a massive canyon for safety. It was burned down by [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] following the rebellion of the local [[Highprince\|highprince]], [[Tanalan\|Tanalan]].
[[Revolar\|Revolar]] - one of the largest cities in the [[Vamah\|Vamah]] princedom. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], it's taken over by the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] and used as a major assembly point for their armies.
[[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] - a large town in the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]], and home of [[Kaladin Stormblessed\|Kaladin Stormblessed]].
[[Dumadari\|Dumadari]] - a major city on the border of Alethkar and [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]].
## History
Alethkar was founded as [[Alethela\|Alethela]] in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch. It survived the Desolations, but fell under the sway of the [[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]] until the [[Sunmaker\|Sunmaker]] led the kingdom in a successful revolt against the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] rule. After the Sunmaker's death, his ten sons could not agree on one of their number as his successor. With none of them willing to forego their claim to the throne, they split the kingdom into ten princedoms, which they ruled individually as [[Highprince\|Highprinces]], with no unifying government.
Several centuries later, in approximately 1158, [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]]--inspired by the Sunmaker--sought to conquer and unite the highprinces, which he achieved by about 1163. He was then crowned king and his brother [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] became highprince to the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] Princedom. However, due to the lineage of each Princedom going back to the Sunmaker and his sons, the Highprinces were loathe to surrender their autonomous power to a supreme ruler. The integrity and unity of Gavilar's kingdom is therefore questionable, as evidenced by the ferocity with which the Highprinces resisted his military approach to unification and continued to strain against his rule. The most severe instance of this was the rebellion in [[Rathalas\|Rathalas]], where Gavilar eventually had to send troops led by [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] in order to quench the revolt, as political means had resulted in a failure.
When Gavilar was assassinated by the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] in 1167, his son [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] became king and declared war on the killers. Each of the highprinces joined the [[Vengeance Pact\|Vengeance Pact]] and they set out into the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to besiege the Parshendi in the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. However, the siege took much longer than was expected, and was still active by 1173. It eventually ended when the Parshendi summoned the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], beginning the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. Afterwards, some of the Highprinces -- [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], [[Aladar\|Aladar]] and [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]] -- along with their remaining forces, took refuge in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], while others remained on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], slowly taking over the abandoned warcamps of those who left and consolidating their power base there.
Meanwhile, the Alethkar homelands were besieged by the newly awakened [[Singer\|singer]] forces led by the [[Fused\|Fused]], culminating in the [[Siege of Kholinar\|siege]] and eventual fall of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
After Elhokar was killed by [[Moash\|Moash]] during the siege, and [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] refused to take the throne after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] became Queen. The current heir to the throne is Elhokar's son, [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]] -- however, he's still a child and a regency in his name was deemed too unstable and dangerous during the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].
A year after the Battle of Thaylen Field Dalinar had managed to retake the southwestern corner of Alethkar which touches the Tarat Sea. Dalinar considered launching a major offensive into Alethkar but was convinced by the [[Dieno\|Mink]] that it would be wiser to attempt to retake Emul.

### People
The Alethi people are generally tan -- darker-skinned than the [[Veden\|Veden]], but not as dark as the [[Makabak\|Makabaki]] -- with dark, typically black hair. They are typically extremely tall, standing on average at least a foot taller than people living further West. In the late [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the Alethi tan and black hair are considered the general standard of beauty. Multicolored hair is also present within Alethkar and is an indication of mixed heritage. Some see this as a sign of an "impure" bloodline, while others use it as evidence of Alethkar's superiority, hard won through conquest. Among the Heralds, [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] and [[Vedel\|Vedeledev]] look Alethi.
Like all [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nations, Alethi practice a division between the sexes. Women have [[Safehand\|safehands]], covered either by a buttoned-up sleeve, typical of lighteyes, or a glove, typical of darkeyes. They are discouraged from picking up weapons and fighting. By contrast, men are forbidden to read. As such, oftentimes a man and a woman will work together as a team in an important position that overlaps both their areas of responsibility, such as the military, with the woman acting as a scribe while the man issues commands. The militaristic nature of the Alethi further influences this divide, leading to most of Alethi rulers being kings, and women rarely, if ever, becoming highprincesses.
Alethi discourage emotional openness and any show of what could be perceived as a weakness; an engaged couple keeping close in public is considered, while not obscene, at least extremely improper. Men are encouraged to be combative and forceful, and women to be witty and willing to engage in barbed banter. Unwillingness or inability to act in this way can often lead to a person being labeled as inept or stupid.

### Caste system
The Alethi culture is divided into two major castes, the **lighteyes** and **darkeyes**, separated by, as can be surmised, the color of a person's eyes. The lighteyes form the upper caste, with broader rights and privileges, while the darkeyes are the lower, working caste. Furthermore, each caste is divided into ten ranks, with the lighteyed ranks being called [[Dahn\|dahns]], while the darkeyed ones are the [[Nahn\|nahns]]. Some nahns and dahns are hereditary, or stable, while others can only be held by attaining a particular position. The Alethi monarch, for example, is the only person in the country holding the first dahn.
There are many ways for a person to improve their rankings, such as through marriage or military service. A soldier who becomes an officer will almost automatically be raised to a proper dahn or nahn, along with their children. Holding land automatically entitles a lighteyes to at least the sixth dahn, regardless of their previous status, and becoming a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] entitles at least the fourth dahn.
Alethkar is generally a feudal nation. The Alethi monarch is served by ten [[Highprince\|highprinces]], which have their own lower-dahn subjects, down to the citylords, who rule over individual settlements. [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]] stand slightly aside from this system, although many of them are either highprinces themselves, or in direct service to one highprince or another.

### Militarism
The Alethi culture is highly militaristic, stemming from their origins as Alethela. A soldier is considered the highest religious Calling, with the fight to reclaim the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]] being believed to be the greatest afterlife one could hope for. The country is almost perpetually at war, if not between the highprinces, then with some external power. Children as young as twelve can and sometimes are recruited by raving armies to feed this endless war machine.
Military service is one of the more reliable paths of social advancement in Alethkar. A soldier can expect to raise in dahn or nahn to match his military rank. Moreover, many darkeyed soldiers go to war hoping to defeat a Shardbearer and gain ownership of a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], due to a widespread belief -- later proven correct -- that bonding a Blade would change their eyes to light-colored.
Alongside this culture, the Alethi highly honor the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], a form of battle-lust that can sometimes encompass them when in combat. The Thrill is often considered a private thing, not to be shared with others; however, it's also highly desirable, with men often awaiting its arrival when in combat. For many, it's downright addictive.

### Religion
>‚Äú*The Alethi preferred to let the ardents deal with the Almighty, like he was some annoying parlor guest who could be safely distracted by servants offering a particularly tasty tea.*‚Äù
\-Shallan[31]


Alethkar is one of the five great [[Vorin\|Vorin]] Kingdoms, with vast majority of their populace worshipping the [[Almighty\|Almighty]]. The worship is mostly carried out by the priests, called the [[Ardent\|ardents]]. The ardents, while influential, are not free -- rather, they are slaves to various [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]. Unlike most other professions, ardentia is open to both men and women, and to people from all social castes. Ardents are considered genderless from a social standpoint, and as such, many of the Vorin taboos regarding gender and gender roles do not apply to them. They are also the only people permitted to use [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]].
Unlike other varieties of Vorinism, the Alethi are not required to be personally devout, or to perform religious ceremonies. While each citizen is supposed to pick their [[Calling\|Calling]] and Glory -- their goal in life, and the aspect of the Almighty they wish to emulate -- the actual religious part of the religion is handled by the ardents, who perform the requisite rituals and prayers for their masters, so as to reassure them of their righteousness. The Alethi themselves rarely interact with the Almighty, save for an occassional glyphward or prayer.

### Language and Writing
For more information, see [[Women's script\|Women's script]].
The Alethi language is part of the Vorin language family, which includes others such as Veden (spoken in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]) and [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]]. It's particularly close to the former, making it easy to learn. Known words from the language include *dahn* and *nahn* for the ranking system, numerous [[Glyph\|glyph]] pronounciations, as well as two terms for family members -- *Mathana*, a formal term for older sister, and *Mashala*, for aunt.
The Alethi language can be written using two different systems. The [[Women's script\|Women's script]], used broadly across eastern Roshar, is an alphabet, with twenty five letters, and at least two symbols -- a mark of maximum character height, at the start of a passage, and a small diactric denoting that a particular letter should be read as an "H". This being said, the women's script is restricted for use by the female part of the populace, in accordance with Vorin cultural rules. Men are permitted to learn [[Glyph\|glyphs]], a separate system where each symbol or pair of symbols represents a separate idea or concept.

## Politics
>‚Äú*Dalinar had been around Alethi politicians so much that he found honesty an obscure thing, like a language he no longer spoke.*‚Äù

### Princedoms
 by  Isaac Stewart  Alethi Princedoms
Though it is ruled by a single king, Alethkar is divided into ten princedoms, each ruled by a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] [[Highprince\|highprince]]. Each princedom is named after the family controlling it, and each has its own military, independent of one another - a remnant of the times prior to the reunification. While the highprinces do work together, the king has limited control over them, maintained less through tradition, and more through sheer military power and access to amenities like [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]]. In addition, the ruling [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] controls the largest territory, as apart from their own princedom, they also hold an underpopulated stretch of land called the [[Eastern Crownlands\|Eastern Crownlands]].

The modern Alethi army is one of the strongest military forces on Roshar with well over 100,000 troops and over thirty [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]]. The army employs most of its troops as spearmen and archers, as well as a very small amount of cavalry due to the rarity of horses on Roshar; only the officers wield swords because, according to Vorin traditions, the sword is regarded as a lighteyed's weapon. Soldiers are usually trained in one or two additional Skills, i.e. horse grooms. Under most circumstances, military service is voluntary, though the leaders of the army has the right of conscription for darkeyes that do not provide an essential function to a community (e.g. a town's only surgeon) when they feel there is need for additional troops. It is extremely rare for a darkeyed soldier to rise higher than the rank of squadleader. Lighteyed officers that have the command of a branch of the army are usually referred by their duties (e.g. cavalrylord, infantrylord).
Despite Alethkar being a monarchy, the king has very little actual say in how the military is run and does not directly command any force other than the 250-strong King's Guard. The troops are sworn to and led by their individual highprinces. In that sense, Alethkar army is not truly a unified army, but a loose coalition between ten smaller armies. Indeed, even in wartime, there is constant in-fighting between the highprinces' armies, and cooperation between the highprinces themselves is seen as a weakness; this is bolstered by the tenets of Vorinism that say the purpose of life is to prepare in order to join the Heralds in the fight to regain the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]] and Alethi belief that everything is a competition in life.
Because of the immense size of the army and the difficulty of travel, [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] plays a vital role in supplying the army with wood, metal, food, and many other necessities, as well as being used in building fortifications. The king controls most of the Soulcaster ardents; in fact, manipulating the highprinces with his Soulcasters is one of the ways that the king maintains a control over them.
Recently, in an effort to truly unify the kingdom, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] has been appointed as the [[Highprince of War\|Highprince of War]] by the king. This title was used in Alethkar before being fragmented into ten princedoms when each highprince was given the ultimate authority over one aspect of the governing of the kingdom. On paper, this gives Kholin authority over all war-related activities.
According to official records, Alethkar possesses more [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] than any other nation on Roshar, with only [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] coming anywhere close.

## Trivia
Alethi are modeled on half Asian and half Hawaiian people, and according to Brandon, picturing Alethi as looking east-Indian works very well.
