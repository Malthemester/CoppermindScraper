## History
May's father included her in many of his politically important events and meetings. She was invited to [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] and [[Navani\|Navani's]] wedding. She was also part of Dalinar's diplomatic team during his early attempts to form the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]], alongside her father, Navani, [[Kalami\|Kalami]] and [[Teshav Khal\|Teshav Khal]]. During the negotiations, she was mostly an observer. She also assisted Navani in collecting information that came in via [[Spanreed\|spanreed]].
May was present when [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] corpse was found. Following the death of [[Vedekar Perel\|Vedekar Perel]], May was instructed by her father—by then, named the [[Highprince of Information\|Highprince of Information]]—to have Perel's family and associates questioned. In light of the murders, she suggested implementing laws to limit movement around the tower. She also participated in scientific discussions with scholars and [[Ardent\|ardents]] regarding the functioning of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
She was present when the news of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar's]] fall arrived, and reacted to it with extreme nausea.
