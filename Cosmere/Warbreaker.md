## Summary
For a complete chapter by chapter summary, see [[Warbreaker/Summary\|/Summary]].
Warbreaker tells the story of two sister princesses, [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] and [[Siri\|Siri]], of the country [[Idris\|Idris]]. Vivenna has been raised her entire life to marry the [[Susebron\|God King]] of the rival nation of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], in the hopes that this marriage will forestall Hallandren's invasion of Idris, which they have been threatening for years. For reasons of political expediency, as well as the personal preferences of the King of Idris, Siri is sent, unprepared, in Vivenna's stead. Vivenna, feeling her life to be devoid of purpose after Siri is sent in her place, follows her to Hallandren in hopes of rescuing her. Both Siri and Vivenna then become involved in intrigues intended to cause war between their home nation of Idris and Hallandren, and attempt to prevent the war from happening separately: Siri from within the government and Vivenna by cooperation with the underground.
At the same time, the novel tells the story of one of the [[Returned\|Returned]] members of the royal court, [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]], and his search for the truth behind the Hallandren religion, as well as that of his own identity. The fourth story that the book follows is that of [[Vasher\|Vasher]], a mysterious character with a talking sword named [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] and an impressive mastery of [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breaths]].
The book is set in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] on the [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] of [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], home to the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Endowment\|Endowment]]. It is told from Vasher's, Siri's, Vivenna's, and Lightsong's points of view.

## Setting
Warbreaker is set in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] on the [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] of [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].

### Magic System
For more information, see [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]].
All individuals are born with a single [[Breath\|Breath]], which can be willingly transferred or given away to another individual. A Breath can be thought of as a soul, or as the manifestation of the 'sixth sense'. A person with no Breaths is called a [[Drab\|Drab]]. Drabs find it difficult to perceive color and do not experience the 'sixth sense' or the odd sensation resulting from someone watching one unobserved. The prominent use of magic on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] is called Awakening, and is reliant on the presence of color and verbal Commands given by the magic user, as well as the use of Breath.
There are several manifestations of BioChromatic magic:


It is important to note that all use or transfer of Breath is considered heresy in [[Idris\|Idris]].

## Development
*Warbreaker* was partially inspired by Brandon wanting to explore what a story with actual living gods would be like, as this was one of the premises of *Elantris*, but, in that story, the [[Elantrian\|gods]] had lost their powers. To distinguish *Warbreaker* from *Elantris*, he made the [[Returned\|Returned]] lack any real power—instead focusing their role in the story on politics, prophecy, and providing wisdom—and also made the Returned forget their past life. *Warbreaker* was also inspired by some scenes Brandon had been imagining from the beginning, like [[Vasher\|Vasher]] finally drawing [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] in Chapter 56 and [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] healing [[Susebron\|Susebron]] in Chapter 57.
*Warbreaker* was also released for free online as it was written, allowing readers to see the rough drafts and deleted scenes years before it was published. Brandon did this despite discouragement from his teams and agent at Tor.

## Trivia
Warbreaker was inspired by [[Dadradah\|Dadradah]], one of the religions that [[Sazed\|Sazed]] preached about, which focused on worshipping art.
Brandon's editor told him that his next story after Elantris and Mistborn had to have some color to it, since those stories were both dark, so he replied that he would then write about a color based magic system.
