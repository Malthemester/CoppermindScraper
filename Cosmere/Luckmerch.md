A **luckmerch** is a type of traveling merchant on Roshar that sells [[Glyphward\|glyphwards]] and other charms. Most people aren’t afraid of luckmerches or hold superstitious beliefs about the sellers themselves, though some such as [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] dislike them, since they don’t actually help anyone in a valuable way. There are several of them in [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas’s]] warcamp, among other businesses that aren’t reputable enough to have a place in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
