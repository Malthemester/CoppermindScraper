The **Sleepless**, also known as **Dysian Aimians**, are a sapient non-human race from an unknown planet in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Their bodies are made up of swarms of creatures called "hordelings" that are mentally linked. They refer to themselves as "Sleepless" because at least some part of the horde is always awake. Some of the Sleepless can be found on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], and they once lived in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Aimia\|Aimia]].

## Appearance and Anatomy

>“*The cook began to hum. Pieces of her broke off. She crumbled to a pile of chittering little cremlings that moved out of her clothing, leaving it in a heap.*”
\-Kaza, watching the cook of the First Dreams[9]


Sleepless have a unique physiology, as their "bodies" are actually composed of thousands of creatures called "hordelings" that are able to function as a single consciousness. The hordelings are not limited in how they assemble themselves; with practice, a Sleepless can mimic the shape of other creatures, including humans. Sleepless not on Roshar would not be practiced in imitating the human form, and would look completely different. Unlike [[Siah Aimian\|Siah Aimians]], Dysian Aimians cannot mate with humans.

### Hordelings
Hordelings are usually about the size of a finger, but they can be as large as a fist or sometimes as large as a building. Hordelings on Roshar often resemble native creatures known as [[Cremling\|cremlings]] simply to make them less noticeable to casual observers; they can take other forms. The [[Yelamaiszin\|first swarm]] to come to Roshar originally had spiderlike hordelings; the swarms breed their hordelings to resemble local fauna in order to blend in. The hordelings of each Sleepless are not all identical, and often serve specific purposes. For example, because [[Arclo\|Arclo]] tries to pass as a human, many of his hordelings have protrusions on their backs that resemble human parts such as skin or eyeballs; he is also able to speak with a passably human voice. However, individual hordelings cannot shapeshift, so the nature of a Sleepless body is usually visible upon close inspection. Sleepless therefore tend to cover their "skin" when possible, or use the appearance of older skin or tattoos to obscure their true nature.

### Adaptation and Regeneration
>“*It took my people three hundred years of selective breeding to achieve hordelings capable of imitating human fingers. And still, most of us are terrible at pretending to be humans. We don't have the mannerisms, the thoughts. I’m younger than the others, but am more... skilled at using these things.*”
\-Nikli[3]


Hordelings can be specially bred to enhance specific capabilities of a Sleepless, such as a heightened sense of smell or increased memory capacity, although this process takes some time. [[Nikli\|Nikli]] notes that it took three hundred years to breed hordelings that could imitate human fingers. Over the course of many generations, some have even managed to breed hordelings that are able to mimic the powers of a [[Larkin\|larkin]]. Specialized hordelings can convincingly mimic inanimate objects. There is a limit on both the total mass and number of hordelings a Sleepless can have at any given time, but the maximum number would definitely allow a Sleepless to become much larger than human-sized, up to the size of a [[Santhid\|santhid]] corpse and possibly even larger. Because they can continually create new hordelings to replace any that are lost, the personality of a Sleepless can live forever, as long as not too many of the hordelings are destroyed at once. Swarms on planets other than Roshar would breed their hordelings as needed to imitate whatever life forms are native to that world.

### Consciousness
In practice, hordelings function as a "hive mind", but they are not technically one entity. Hordelings have the ability to separate from the main body to act as remote agents while maintaining their mental link with the rest of the horde. Certain circumstances could lead to a hordeling being split off from the group and forced to act independently. For example, a hordeling that is physically too distant from the others can lose contact with the main mind, and this would affect its [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] aspect. A hordeling could be affected by a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, but it would disconnect it from the hivemind. The Sleepless are not able to split their consciousness between the Cognitive Realm and the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. They can form multiple sapient bodies at once (for example, imitating two humans at the same time), but it is difficult and risks making the split permanent, unintentionally creating a new Sleepless. This is made easier if the bodies are not engaged in intelligent tasks at the same time.

### Reproduction
Sleepless are able to reproduce, but "reproduction" for them has a variety of connotations. They can breed specific hordelings for specialized purposes over time and can also exchange hordelings if needed in order to improve their genetic diversity. They can even crossbreed hordelings with other species such as various cremlings and the [[Lancer\|lancer]]. Creating a new Sleepless involves splitting off a subsection of an existing swarm, which subsequently gains independence over time; the Sleepless term for this process is becoming "Separated". A swarm becoming Separated is not always intentional. Newly independent swarms retain the genetic adaptations of their "parent" swarm and are able to fine-tune the evolutions of their hordelings to even greater effect. Arclo refers to the other swarms on Roshar as its "siblings".

## Attributes and Abilities
All Sleepless have the abilities granted by their unusual physiology, including shapeshifting, adaptive evolution, and effective immortality. It is also impossible to imprison a Sleepless through conventional means. Sleepless have used [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] in the past and may use it again in the future. Arclo is able to easily kill two of [[Nale\|Nale's]] [[Skybreaker\|Skybreaker]] apprentices and tells [[Lift\|Lift]] that it would not have been possible for them to kill it. Sleepless would have nothing to fear even from someone as powerful as a Herald, and the Heralds knew to leave their kind alone. Sleepless have more resistance to [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] compared to humans for various reasons. They are also fluent in most, if not all, human languages.
In addition to their ability to mentally link their hordelings, each Sleepless can also directly communicate with other swarms. This is achieved through buzzing that each swarm can emanate from its scattered hordelings. Each swarm has a distinct buzz, and specially bred hordelings receive and interpret the vibrations. It is possible to exclude certain swarms from these communications.
The Sleepless are exceptionally [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]-aware. At least some Sleepless have had the power of [[Worldhopper\|Worldhopping]]; Arclo tells Lift that it once traveled to a land she will never visit. They have some relationship to the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] and another unnamed group in the cosmere. They are aware that some [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] are [[Sighted\|Sighted]] and that they guard [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]]. They hold secrets about the power of the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshards]] and the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]], and they have passed this information down to their "younger" members. They refer to [[Lancer\|lanceryn]] and [[Larkin\|larkin]] as "Ancient Guardians" and believed that protecting the [[Akinah Dawnshard mural\|Akinah Dawnshard mural]] was important to the fate of the entire cosmere.

## Social Structure and Purpose
>“*Arclomedarian is dangerous. I can see this. But it is not as dangerous as the true traitors.*”
\-Nikli, on Arclo[29]


Of the twenty-four known Sleepless on Roshar, twenty accept the authority of [[Yelamaiszin\|Yelamaiszin]], the First swarm, including Yelamaiszin himself. They vote on important matters using the rapid communication provided by their hive minds. [[Arclomedarian\|Arclomedarian]] does not accept their authority, although it is not considered one of the "true traitors" and is still liked. It is unknown if the other three dissident Sleepless are in this category, though all four of the Sleepless who do not accept Yelamaiszin's authority (including Arclo) are still alive. The Sleepless defend life, although they are willing to kill in order to preserve it. Nikli states that the Sleepless have chosen to do this after seeing the destruction of worlds and have vowed to never let it happen again. Paradoxically, while the Sleepless tend to like the Knights Radiant, with Yelamaiszin even stating a personal admiration for Dalinar, they worry that the Radiants' insistence on making honorable choices is highly dangerous. Despite a willingness to kill in order to protect the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] from outside knowledge, the Sleepless are also open to reason. Rysn managed to convince them to spare the crew of the *Wandersail* in exchange for her help in safeguarding it.

## Lore
Most Rosharans (other than Siah Aimians) do not know that the Sleepless exist, with a few notable exceptions. At least some Iriali have been aware of them and the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]], who call them the "Gods Who Sleep Not", even have some understanding of their hordeling abilities. Neither [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] nor [[Lift\|Lift]] seem to have even heard of beings with the powers of the Sleepless prior to talking to Hoid and Arclo, respectively. However, a few folk tales about them persisted over the years, and [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] was aware of these tales through her scholarly research. She assumed that they were myths, until she began hearing credible stories about similar creatures, possibly including Lift's interaction with Arclo. Even then, Jasnah could not fully believe such beings existed until meeting one in person. Although [[Vstim\|Vstim]] passed information about Sleepless on to Rysn, she did not rule out some form of [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]] to explain her early observations of Nikli's shapeshifting until seeing its powers up close.

## History
### Origins
Sleepless, or Dysian Aimians, exist on multiple planets in the cosmere and are known to have traveled between them. Their original planet is unknown, but they are not native to [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] is the only person known to use the term "Dysian," and the source of the term is unknown. All known Sleepless on Roshar descended from a single swarm currently named [[Yelamaiszin\|Yelamaiszin]]. Most of the cosmere's Sleepless live on Roshar, but unrelated swarms exist on other worlds.
Although not native to Roshar, the Sleepless lived in Aimia prior to the [[Scouring of Aimia\|Scouring of Aimia]], which has been characterized by [[Hessi\|Hessi]] as "total destruction". They coexisted with the [[Siah Aimian\|Siah Aimians]], but were not related to them. Despite the fact that they survived, the destruction of their home on Aimia seems to have caused the Sleepless a great deal of emotional pain.

### Heraldic Epochs
>“*You needn't fear me. Your war is my war, and has been for millennia. Ancient Radiants named me friend and ally before everything went wrong. What wonderful days those were, before the Last Desolation. Days of... honor. Now gone, long gone.*”
\-Arclo, to Lift[5]


The Sleepless had a long history with the [[Herald\|Heralds]] and [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Some Sleepless were once able to use the power of [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]]. At least some of the Sleepless, including Arclo, were allies of the Heralds and Knights Radiant during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]]. Arclo told [[Lift\|Lift]] that others of his kind were particularly interested in Radiants. At least one Sleepless may have fought during [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], as [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] noticed a heap of burned, strange cremlings in one of [[Dalinar's visions\|his visions]]; it is not clear which side they fought on, although at least some Sleepless were allied with the Knights Radiant.

### War of Reckoning
At the end of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the Sleepless mostly remained hidden, monitoring events on Roshar using their hordelings. They were particularly interested in Dalinar, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Szeth\|Szeth]], [[Navani\|Navani]], [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]], and [[Venli\|Venli]], believing them to be crucial to the future of Roshar. Arclo believed that [[Lift\|Lift]] should also be included in that group, and that the other Sleepless should not ignore her. Despite its general disinterest in Radiants, Arclo was also aware that the [[Stump\|Stump]] had bonded a spren and that [[Nale\|Nale]] was alive, referring to him as a "madman".

>“*Rysn, there are forces in the cosmere that we can barely identify, let alone track. Evil forces, who would end worlds if they could. They are hunting this place. Now that the Ancient Guardians of Akinah are all but extinct, we Sleepless must protect it.*”
\-Nikli[3]

The Sleepless appeared to be guarding several secrets from humans, including something that Dalinar was seeking but "must not know". An unnamed Sleepless learned of [[Vazrmeb\|Vazrmeb's]] plan to sail the ship *First Dreams* to [[Akinah\|Akinah]] in Aimia; it posed as a [[Reshi\|Reshi]] cook and joined the crew, later poisoning everyone else on board to protect the island. It refused to divulge any of Akinah's secrets to [[Kaza\|Kaza]] even as she was dying, telling her that doing so could result in the "ends of worlds".

### True Desolation and the Expedition to Akinah
By the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], there were twenty-four Sleepless on Roshar. As both Siah Aimians and Sleepless were immortal, the remaining individuals seemed to be aware of each other.
The Sleepless were forced into conflict with humans again due to Radiant interest in the city of Akinah. Although they had managed to dissuade early patrols of Windrunners from surveying the island using specialized [[Larkin\|larkin]] hybrid hordelings, their vehemence in protecting the island only attracted more attention to it. After Queen Navani commissioned Rysn's ship, the *Wandersail*, to investigate the oddities during the [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]], the Sleepless were forced into steadily more aggressive confrontations with the ship's crew. These engagements resulted in the unmasking of one of their agents, [[Nikliasorm\|Nikliasorm]], fatally compromising the security of their entire operation. [[Rysn\|Rysn]] and [[Cord\|Cord]] managed to discover a hidden chamber underneath the island, and the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] entered Rysn's consciousness. At the same time, the Sleepless battled [[Lopen\|Lopen]], [[Huio\|Huio]], and the crew of the *Wandersail* on the beach, killing three sailors.
Despite these events, the Dawnshard maintained anonymity thanks to Rysn's careful planning and negotiating. Nikli revealed a number of secrets about the Dawnshard, and Rysn saw an opportunity to strike a bargain to keep the Dawnshard hidden and train the Sleepless to better pass as human. The Sleepless accepted her deal, also giving her some [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] and a set of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] for Cord and agreeing to avoid attacking Radiants. Rysn and Cord were sworn to secrecy regarding the Dawnshard, although they were allowed to tell people an altered version of their story. The Sleepless indicated that they would monitor them with hordelings to ensure that they lived up to the bargain.
After Rysn struck the deal, the Sleepless were at least somewhat willing to work with other humans, as one of them met with [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] in person. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] reported to Jasnah that he did not think any of the Sleepless were working with [[Odium\|Odium]], but at least one of them was allied with the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]]. One of the swarms replaced one of Hoid's pens with a hordeling evolved to resemble a pen. Hoid was baffled as to how it had evaded protections he had put in place to avoid such an infiltration. Hoid hoped a friendly swarm might be responsible, but he and Jasnah assumed that it was a spy that was reporting on Hoid's activities to [[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar]], likely through [[Mraize\|Mraize]].

## Trivia
The Sleepless were inspired by the Tines in *A Fire Upon the Deep*, but can spread their members farther apart.
Brandon first included Sleepless-like beings in his early sci-fi novel *Star's End*. He later migrated them into the cosmere as he wanted a "truly alien" species.
The blurbs on the back covers of the *Stormlight Archive* books are written from an in-universe perspective and are authored by a Sleepless. The specific swarm is unknown, although it is presumably not Arclo due to its professed disinterest in the Radiants.
The Sleepless will play a major role in Mistborn Era 4.
