## History
In the first vote of the Taishin on the subject, Gennel voted for the dissolution of the [[Diem\|Diem]], saying that [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]] is too dangerous. He was unavailable when [[N'Teese\|N'Teese]] attempted to set up a meeting with him on behalf of [[Khriss\|Khriss]].
When [[Kenton\|Kenton]] was searching for [[Vey\|Vey]] he visited Gennel in his home and used his sand to pull Gennel's assistant into the air and threatened to turn it on him if he wouldn't tell him where Vey went. Terrified, Gennel begged Kenton not make him tell since Vey will be very angry with him. Kenton realized he is being mean and let Gennel's assistant down. He then told Gennel that he won't force him to answer, but asked him to please tell him where Vey went. Gennel refuses and Kenton leaves.
In the final vote of the Taishin, Gennel voted in favor of the Diem. It is implied that this is because Gennel always listens to Vey.
