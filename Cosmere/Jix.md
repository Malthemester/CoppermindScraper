**Jix** is a guard for [[House Davar\|House Davar]] in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Jix is a [[Lighteyed\|lighteyes]] of the eighth [[Dahn\|dahn]]. He has a gut, but is very strong. He rarely combs his hair and often chews [[Yamma root\|yamma root]]. While performing his guard duties, he wears a weapon, likely a sword.
Despite being of a low dahn, he exhibits the typical lighteyed disdain for [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] people. He is loyal to House Davar and serves [[Lin\|Lin]] for over a decade, and he has a good rapport with the Davar children. He presumably has a penchant for gambling.

## History
Jix accompanied the Davar household to the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] in 1170. He followed [[Shallan\|Shallan]] when she slipped away from Lin and walked around the festival. He grudgingly accompanied her into the gambling pavilion, and was relieved when he realized that she was just looking for [[Balat\|Balat]] in order to deliver a letter from [[Eylita Tavinar\|Eylita Tavinar]]. Several people in the gambling pavilion said hello to Jix.
Jix and his fellow guard [[Ekel\|Ekel]] were present when [[Mill\|Mill]] attempted to extort Lin over [[Jushu Davar\|Jushu Davar's]] debts. He was armed and prepared to fight, if necessary. Jix seemed a bit baffled that Lin refused to pay Mill and allowed him to take Jushu.
Jix and the other Davar household guards that [[Shallan\|Shallan]] had grown up with were later replaced after the [[Ghostblood\|Ghostbloods]] took interest in [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]] and [[Luesh\|Luesh]] was installed as his house steward. The guards who replaced Jix and his colleagues were far more brutal and bloody, and the Davar children wished that the old guards were still around.
