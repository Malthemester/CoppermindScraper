**Sinaku'a** is an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] related to [[Kef'ha\|Kef'ha]] and [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]].
Based on Unkalaki cultural traditions, Sinaku'a was presumably related to his [[Nuatoma\|nuatoma]] [[Kef'ha\|Kef'ha]]. Sinaku'a and Lunamor were both part of a family group that traveled to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] as part of Kef'ha's quest to win [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] from [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]]. However, Sadeas murdered Kef'ha without a proper duel. Lunamor stated that Sinaku'a and [[Tifi\|Tifi]] were among those killed after raising weapons in vengeance, likely after Sadeas seized Kef'ha's property and turned his family into servants.
When [[Tuaka\|Tuaka]] was reunited with Lunamor, she asked after Sinaku'a and Tifi. Her reaction implied that they were Lunamor's older siblings and that their death meant that he had gained elevated status, possibly becoming nuatoma himself. However, Lunamor did not wish to discuss the matter, and Sinaku'a's identity was left ambiguous.
