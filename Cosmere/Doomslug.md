## Appearance and Personality
For more information, see [[Taynix\|taynix]].
Doomslug is a yellow slug with blue spikes along her backside. She does not appear to have eyes, a mouth, or any of the components of a face, but her behavior reminds Spensa of a chipmunk. When pleased, Doomslug emits a flutelike trill from her spikes.

## Attributes and Abilities
For more information, see [[Taynix\|taynix]].
### Cytonics
As a taynix, Doomslug has the ability to travel at faster-than-light speeds by accessing the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]] and can distract the [[Delver\|delvers]] from the [[Cytonics\|cytonic]] hyperjump so that they won't be drawn into the universe. It is unclear whether or not Doomslug has or could learn any other cytonic powers. She also has the ability to shapeshift and disguise herself as other objects, as seen when she transforms into Spensa's father's flight pin.

### Mimicry
Doomslug can replicate any sound she hears with impeccable precision, though there is always a "distinctly fluty" sound to it. She is also capable of slightly modifying the sounds she mimics, as shown when she accidentally corrects Spensa's grammar by saying "By whom!" in response to the question "By who?"

### Protection
Doomslug is covered in blue spikes, which would make handling her difficult, and provides protection from predators. Her bright colors also lead Spensa to believe the possibility that she might be poisonous. She is also capable of resisting minor increases in gravitational forces.

## History
 by  Jill Andersen 
### Early Life
Almost nothing is known about Doomslug's life prior to meeting Spensa.

### Meeting Spensa
Doomslug took up residence near M-Bot after he was hidden by Commander Spears, who had flown his ship to Detritus in search of taynix slugs. After Spensa arrived, the slug observed her, but engaged in minimal interaction. As their relationship progressed, Doomslug became more open, often enthusiastically repeating words and eventually complex phrases spoken by Spensa and Rig, as well as trilling in enjoyment when rubbed on the head.
When Spensa began her first flight with M-Bot, Doomslug took residence in the seat behind Spensa.

### Adventures to Starsight
While undercover at Starsight, Spensa finds out that Doomslug is a taynix and has the capability to hyperjump ships.

### In the Nowhere
When Spensa was escaping from Starsight, she took Doomslug with her through the Nowhere portal. Doomslug was nervous, and sent Spensa the location of Detritus so she could jump there. Spensa chose to search for answers in the nowhere however, and sent instructions to Doomslug to return home. To Doomslug however, Spensa equaled home, so she stayed with Spensa as she entered the Belt. Doomslug transformed into a reality icon, taking the form of [[Zeen Nightshade\|Spensa’s father’s]] pilot’s pin. Spensa didn’t equate the two, thinking that Doomslug had returned to Detritus. When Spensa buried Doomslug to hide the pin from [[Chet\|Chet]], Doomslug was annoyed and hyperjumped away to [[Surehold\|Surehold]], where she hid with [[Peg\|Peg]]’s taynix, who was also hiding as a reality icon.
Doomslug communicated in a vague manner to Spensa as she traveled, but Spensa thought Doomslug might somehow be the soul or spirit of her father, speaking to her. When Spensa and [[Cutlass Flight\|Cutlass Flight]], along with other pirates, attacked Surehold, Doomslug and the other taynix hid. Spensa eventually followed Doomslug’s communication to her hiding place, and found her. When Doomslug fluted happily, Spensa realized that Doomslug was the pin. She was able to speak to Spensa cytonically, but using more intelligent words rather than mimicry. Doomslug was able to answer some of Spensa’s questions, and told Spensa that there are “tons” of types of taynix, not just the yellow and blue ones.
Doomslug stayed with Spensa and her friends as they flew towards the lightburst and the delvers, in an attempt to return home. Doomslug used her abilities to disguise M-Bot and the others from the delvers, but after a few hours she grew too tired to continue doing so. Doomslug liked M-Bot, considering him a nice nest. After a fierce and impossible fight, Spensa had to land near the lightburst, and Doomslug again concealed the ship and it’s occupants. When M-Bot sacrificed himself, Doomslug was sorrowful, but it made shielding Spensa and [[Hesho\|Hesho]] easier. As they entered the lightburst, Doomslug protected Hesho from the potentially deadly force of the pure nowhere, keeping him alive. After expending so much effort, Doomslug was exhausted, and fell unconscious as Spensa hyperjumped back to Detritus. Afterward, safely on [[Platform Prime\|Platform Prime]], Doomslug awoke and was fine.
