>“*I am a guide, but I cannot solve a hero's problems for him. It is not the way of the Survivor, who deems that all men must make their own way.*”
\-Lyndip[1]


**Lyndip** is [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]] [[Jak\|Jak's]] spirit guide on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. Jak claims that Lyndip appears to him during moments of great danger or difficulty. She has the appearance of a talking crow, but Jak suspects that she is one of the [[Kandra\|Faceless Immortals]]. She purports to follow and speak for the [[Survivor\|Survivor]], and Jak regards her as sent by him.
[[Handerwym\|Handerwym]], Jak's [[Terris\|Terrisman]] steward, has never seen Lyndip and cannot confirm her existence. He suspects that at least one instance of Lyndip's appearances was a hallucination. He has also pointed out that the Faceless Immortals are a feature of [[Pathism\|Pathism]], not [[Survivorism\|Survivorism]], but Jak does not seem to care.

## Trivia
[[Brandon\|Brandon]] has not confirmed whether Lyndip is a [[Kandra\|kandra]], an [[Aviar\|Aviar]], or whether she even actually exists.
