## Personality and Appearance
Dirin is a young man with red hair and light skin. He believes that a sand master's actions should determine their rank rather than merely their natural strength.

## Attributes and Abilities
Dirin is a weak [[Sand mastery\|sand master]] who is barely able to control one ribbon. He makes up for this by being skilled at bureaucracy and running the day to day operations of the Diem.

## History
Dirin was admitted into the [[Diem\|Diem]] and is currently an acolent. He became friends with [[Kenton\|Kenton]] while the two were acolents together, even though Kenton was much older than him. After Kenton's run through the [[Mastrell's Path\|Mastrell's Path]] Dirin attended him in his tent until [[Traiben\|Traiben]] sent him away so he could speak about the Path's secrets with Kenton. Kenton and Dirin discussed rumors about [[Drile\|Drile's]] infractions before the ceremony in the [[Kerla\|Kerla]] began. Dirin, being one of the weaker sand masters, wasn't targeted by the [[Kerztian\|Kerztians]] who attacked the Diem during the ceremony, and was one of the few sand masters who survived the massacre. After the battle, Dirin returned to the Diem in [[Kezare\|Kezare]] with the other surviving sand masters.

Dirin showed respect for Drile's higher rank despite his frustration with the man's imperious leadership. Believing Drile would be raised by the [[Taishin\|Taishin]] as the new Lord Mastrell, Dirin returned to the Diem to retrieve a mastrell's sash when he found Kenton sitting there in mourning. Dirin informed Kenton of the [[Taishin\|Taishin's]] meeting and the two left together for the [[Hall of Judgement\|Hall of Judgement]]. Upon learning that Kenton was made a mastrell prior to the attack, Dirin encouraged Kenton to assert his rank over Drile and take on the role of Lord Mastrell.
After Kenton prevented the immediate disbanding of the Diem and was made acting Lord Mastrell, Dirin served as his assistant in running the Diem and serving Kenton and his guests. Kenton had Dirin to set up ladders to the upper levels of the Diem so that guests and weaker sand masters would be able to access them. Later Dirin hired workers to build permanent staircases in every corner of the Diem.
After Kenton challenged Drile to a duel, in an attempt to find a way to defeat Drile, Kenton and Dirin experimented with different ways of using ribbons to attack other ribbons. Through their experiments, Kenton realized that the advantage of having so many ribbons was that they could be used to disrupt the opposing master's ribbons with ease, and that he would have to find a way to control more ribbons if he was going to defeat Drile.
Dirin brought [[Delius\|Delius']] messenger, who had come to invite Kenton and [[Khriss\|Khriss]] to a ball in his honor. Later, he brought news to Kenton that the [[Lord Mason\|Lord Mason]] had heard of Kenton's antics at the construction site, where he had saved some of [[Trell (Taldain)\|Trell's]] workers, and, impressed by what Kenton had done, was going to vote for the Diem.
During Kenton's duel with Drile he remarked to [[Elorin\|Elorin]] that Kenton always believed that he could do more with one ribbon than anyone else could do with dozens, and that this was how he was winning against Drile. After Kenton defeated Drile and won the vote of the Taishin, Dirin came to get him, saying that Drile wanted to speak with him.
Kenton sent Dirin with Khriss when she returned to Darkside so she could do experiments with the five barrels of [[Investiture\|Invested]] sand she was bringing with her. Kenton promised Khriss that he would go to Darkside to visit her and fetch Dirin, who was indispensable when it came to running the Diem. During the journey Dirin tries teaching [[Baon\|Baon]] how to master sand, and to Baon's surprise, succeeds.
