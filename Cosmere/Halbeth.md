Dr. **Halbeth** is a doctor in the [[DDF\|Defiant Defense Force]].
Dr. Halbeth is involved in studying [[Spensa\|Spensa's]] brainwaves and believes the increase in activity in the [[Writellum\|Writellum]] section of her brain when interacting with the [[Varvax\|Krell]] is proof of the defect. Based on this conclusion, he recommends removing Spensa immediately from Flight School. On [[Ironsides\|Ironsides']] orders, Dr. Halbeth condemns Dr. [[Thior\|Thior's]] alternative explanations of Spensa's brain readings.
