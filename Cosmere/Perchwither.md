**Perchwither** is a bioluminescent fungus which grows only in the [[Kandra Homeland\|kandra Homeland]]. It generates a dim blue light, which the [[Kandra\|kandra]] grow eyes specifically to see effectively inside.
A **glowstone** is a large, porous rock which perchwither grows on. [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] noted that the [[Trustwarren\|Trustwarren]] did not use glowstone for its light, instead being lit with oil lamps with blue glass.
It is possible that this is related to [[Glowpaste\|glowpaste]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].
