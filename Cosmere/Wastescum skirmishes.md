The **wastescum skirmishes** are raids by [[Reshi\|Reshi]] on the northern coast of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] that occurred early in the reign of [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]].
[[Jost\|Jost's]] father fought in them, and claims to have won a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] though another man took the credit, and the Blade. As the Reshi are said to have never possessed Shardblades, this is likely a false claim.
