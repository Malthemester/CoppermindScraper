The **Song of Prayer** is a song that can be used by [[Singer\|singers]] to create [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] [[Spheres\|spheres]].
The role of the song in the creation of Voidlight spheres is unknown. However, [[Navani\|Navani's]] research into the pure tones of Roshar allowed her to manipulate Voidlight, even mixing it with other [[Lights\|Lights]] inside of a sphere. The tone and rhythm of the Song of Prayer is therefore likely related to the creation of Voidlight spheres.
[[Odium\|Odium's]] forces are not seen using the Song of Prayer in battle, even when they are running low on Voidlight. It is unclear why this is the case, but [[Fused\|Fused]] and [[Regal\|Regals]] seem to have abundant spheres available to them and it may be easier or faster to simply retrieve more spheres rather than create new ones. [[Venli\|Venli]] knew that singing the Song of Prayer could draw Odium's attention, and did not dare to try and create her own Voidlight spheres during the occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
