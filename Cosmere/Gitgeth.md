>“* The little rhythmless ones want to be near us. They sense that something is wrong with their minds, I tell you.*”
\- Gitgeth on the parshmen[1]


**Gitgeth** is a [[Listener\|listener]] who attends the feast in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] the night of [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] assassination.
He wears rubies in his beard and has prominent red colors in his skin. He's considerate, worrying about the [[Parshmen\|parshmen]] and letting [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] go her own way and explore the [[Kholinar palace\|Kholinar palace]] while he and the others handled the unloading of the drums.
His fate after the feast is uncertain. As only the original [[Council of Five\|Council of Five]] stayed behind to take responsibility for the assassination, it's possible that he fled to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] along with Eshonai and the rest, but what happened to him afterwards is unknown.
