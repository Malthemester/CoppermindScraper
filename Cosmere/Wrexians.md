>“*[Humans] are aggressive, yes, but not on the level of, say, a cormax drone or the wrexians.*”
\-Sssizme[1]


The **wrexians** are a species or people known to the [[Superiority\|Superiority]].
Very little is known about them; not what they look like, where they come from or whether they are some sort of client or member of the Superiority. What is known is that they're extremely aggressive, more so than humanity, and they apparently cannot be "domesticated" the way some humans have been by the Superiority officials. However, they have much less [[Cytonics\|cytonics]] users than humans, and are neither as industrious nor as quick to spread.
