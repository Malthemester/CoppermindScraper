## Location and Appearance
For more images, see [[Kredik Shaw/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
It is built on top of the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] by [[Rashek\|Rashek]] after he remodels the surrounding geography to hide the well from those seeking it in the mountains of [[Terris\|Terris]].
It has many peaked spires and sheer towers that rise high into the air, all of varying thickness. Some are large enough to contain large rooms and stairwells, and others are simply nothing more than thin rods of metal. There are no outer defensive walls surrounding the palace.
One part of the palace contains a large, domed room with many murals, including a [[Terris\|mountain]], a large cavern, a [[Well of Ascension\|pool of light]], and [[Ruin\|something very dark]]. At the center of this room is a small, single-story building with a wooden door. Words are carved into the door, probably in the ancient [[Terris\|Terris]] language. The stone of this building is carved with ornate, flowing patterns.
Being in the area immediately around Kredik Shaw gives one a feeling of immense depression, as if a constant, strong [[Brass\|Soothing]] were taking place. This is caused by the Lord Ruler himself.

## History
 by  Steve Argyle 
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and [[Mare\|Mare]] once infiltrated the palace but were discovered and captured, resulting in them being detained at the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]].
After Kelsier escapes and re-forms [[Kelsier's crew\|his thieving crew]], he and [[Vin\|Vin]] infiltrate once again but are chased away by [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]], resulting in Vin being seriously injured. They manage to retrieve [[Alendi's journal\|a book]] from one of the rooms, which [[Sazed\|Sazed]] later translates.
After Kelsier's death, Vin once again infiltrates the palace, making it to the Lord Ruler's lair before being captured by [[Kar (Scadrial)\|Kar]]. She is then taken to a holding cell before being escorted to a throne room to be interrogated by Kar to implicate and remove [[Tevidian\|Tevidian]] as the head of the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]]. After the execution she is returned to her cell before being freed by [[Sazed\|Sazed]] and [[Elend\|Elend]]. She then returns to the throne room and attacks the Lord Ruler with [[Marsh\|Marsh's]] help, eventually using the power of the mists to kill the Lord Ruler.
[[Vin\|Vin]] destroys the palace after becoming [[Preservation\|Preservation]] during her last fight with Ruin's remaining Inquisitors. Remnants of the palace are forced in to the ground inside a large crater caused by this event.

## Trivia
It is the place of death of Vin's Father, [[Tevidian Tekiel\|Tevidian Tekiel]].
