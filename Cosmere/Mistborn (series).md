## Era 2: Wax and Wayne Series
Set about 300 years after Era 1, the Wax and Wayne series is about the exploits of [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], a "wild-west Deputy" forced to move into the big city, and starts investigating kidnappings and robberies.

|**2014**|*Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania*|N/A|Short Story|Released in the [[Alloy of Law (rule book)\|Alloy of Law supplement]] of the *Mistborn Adventure Game*, later in *Arcanum Unbounded*||

*The Alloy of Law* was initially conceived as one of several short stories Brandon wanted to set between the first and second main trilogies that eventually grew into a full novel, and then a series. The Wax and Wayne series is a single four book series, however *The Alloy of Law* stands more-or-less alone while the rest are plotted together like a trilogy.

Brandon has also said that he may do some more stories before the second trilogy, set in a 1940's society.


## Era 3: Second Mistborn Trilogy
The second trilogy will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. The main character is planned as a Terris woman who is a computer programmer and [[Nicrosil\|Nicroburst]]; her brother is also planned to be a character. Peter has described her as a "brown Terris geek girl", though he does point out that this could change by the time the series is actually being written.
The [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] will be well known by the rest of Scadrial in this era.
Brandon had initially planned for the trilogy to feature an Allomancer SWAT team, but is now leaning more towards a spy thriller. It will probably be released in the 2020s, after *Stormlight 5* and the *Elantris* sequels.
These will be returning to the length of the Mistborn Era One books.


## Era 4: Third Mistborn Trilogy
The third trilogy is going to be a space-opera with [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]-powered faster-than-light technology. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] will be a main character in this trilogy. The [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]], or Dysian Aimians, will also have a major role in this trilogy.
There may be two more currently untitled cosmere series written before this trilogy.
He plans for each Era 4 book to be around the length of a Stormlight book.
