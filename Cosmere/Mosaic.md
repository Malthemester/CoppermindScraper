**Mosaic** is a [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] bonded to [[Vathah\|Vathah]]. In [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], her head pattern has sharp lines in it and often includes rapid sections that look like [[Women's script\|women's script]].
In 1175, Vathah and Mosaic were chosen by [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to accompany an ambassadorial group from the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. Mosaic and the other Cryptics enjoyed watching Shallan sketch on the journey, though their unwavering attention and delight in her mistakes unsettled the [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]]. The group entered Shadesmar at [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and traveled to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]], where the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] denied most of them entry. It is unclear if Vathah and Mosaic then remained camped outside the fortress or if they returned to Urithiru with news of [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin's]] impending trial.
