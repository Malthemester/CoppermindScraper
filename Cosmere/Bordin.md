\-Dalinar hatching a plan to reveal Amaram[2]


**Bordin** is a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] footman in the employ of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Bordin is a young darkeyed [[Alethi\|Alethi]] man, with short dark hair and prominent eyebrows.
Bordin is one of Dalinar's most trusted footmen, and Dalinar uses him to trick [[Amaram\|Amaram]] into revealing his more sinister ways.

## History
Bordin accompanied a madman--actually the Herald [[Taln\|Taln]]--from [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], and spent some of the trip in the company of [[Wit\|Wit]]. Wit insulted his intelligence, and Bordin said the madman was a better companion than Wit.
On Dalinar's orders, he went drinking with some of Amaram's guards and sowed rumors of treasure that the madman claimed he had hidden in the area. After hiding Taln's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] in a nearby cavern, he waited to see what Amaram would do.
He later accompanied Amaram to the cell in Dalinar's temple where Taln was being housed. He reinforced the rumor of a hidden cache of Blades while Amaram tried to interview Taln, and presumably then accompanied Amaram on his search for the cache. Because the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] had gotten wind of the situation, [[Mraize\|Mraize]] sent [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to infiltrate the cell, and she happened to be there at the time when Bordin and Amaram arrived.
Bordin's report on the matter was trusted enough by Dalinar to precipitate Dalinar's confronting Amaram on the matter and stripping him of the position as head of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].
