**Mab** is a cook from [[Idris\|Idris]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
She was born in Idris, but left to live in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] during her teenage years, eventually becoming a reputable courtesan in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]]. She gave her [[Breath\|Breath]] to a customer with whom she had fallen in love, and he left her afterwards. When she was a [[Drab\|Drab]], she began to have more trouble finding work, being eventually forced to run a poor whorehouse, while using old contacts to acquire clients. Once she had earned enough money, she bought another Breath and left to go back to Idris, becoming a cook in the kitchens.
She is [[Siri\|Siri's]] friend and maternal figure. She takes a traditional view on religion, gently chiding Siri for being excessively ostentatious in her spontaneity. According to Siri, she has a tendency to fret, and a wisdom to her which goes beyond her cooking abilities.

## Trivia
Brandon originally intended her to accompany Siri to T'Telir but it undermined Siri's loneliness.
