This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Kaladin's squad** was a group of solders in [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who fought in small border skirmishes. They attempted to show enough promise so as to be transferred to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] where real soldiers fought because it was said to be much safer there. Most of the squad was killed during an attempt on Amaram's life by [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]] amidst a border skirmish between the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]] and another [[Alethi\|Alethi]] princedom, presumably one of the two bordering princedoms, the [[Vamah princedom\|Vamah princedom]] or the [[Aladar princedom\|Aladar princedom]].
