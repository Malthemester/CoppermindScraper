## History
Tor was founded by [[Tom Doherty\|Tom Doherty]], Harriet McDougal, and Jim Baen in 1980. They were soon joined by Barbara Doherty and Katherine Pendill, who then composed the original startup team. 
*Tor* is a word from Old English meaning "the peak of a rocky hill or mountain", as depicted in Tor's logo. Tor Books was sold to [[St. Martin's Press\|St. Martin's Press]] in 1987. Along with St. Martin's Press; [[Henry Holt and Company\|Henry Holt]]; and [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux\|Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], it became part of the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group\|Holtzbrinck]] group, now part of [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)\|Macmillan]] in the US. In June 2019, Tor and other Macmillan imprints moved from the [[Flatiron Building\|Flatiron Building]], to larger offices in the [[Equitable Building (New York City)\|Equitable Building]].

## Imprints
Tor is the primary imprint of Tom Doherty Associates. There is also the Forge imprint that publishes an array of fictional titles, including historical novels and thrillers. Tor Books also publishes two imprints for young readers: Starscape (for readers 10 years of age and up) and Tor Teen (for readers 13 years of age and up). Tor Books also has the Tor.com imprint that focuses on short works such as [[Novellas\|novellas]], shorter novels and serializations.
A United Kingdom sister imprint, Tor UK, also exists and specializes in science fiction, fantasy, and horror, while also publishing young-adult crossover fiction based on computer-game franchises. Tor UK briefly maintained an open submission policy, which ended in January 2013.
[[Orb Books\|Orb Books]] publishes science-fiction classics such as [[A.E. Van Vogt\|A.E. Van Vogt]]'s *Slan*.
[[Tor Teen\|Tor Teen]] publishes young-adult novels such as [[Cory Doctorow\|Cory Doctorow]]'s *Little Brother* and repackages novels such as [[Orson Scott Card\|Orson Scott Card]]'s *Ender's Game* for younger readers.
Tor Labs produces [[Podcast\|podcasts]].
A German sister imprint, Fischer Tor, was founded in August 2016 as an imprint of [[S. Fischer Verlag\|S. Fischer Verlag]] (which also belongs to Holtzbrinck Publishing Group). It publishes international titles translated into German, as well as original German works. Fischer Tor also publishes the German online magazine *Tor Online*, which is based on the same concept as the English *Tor.com* online magazine, but has its own independent content.

## E-books
Tor publishes a range of its works as [[E-book\|e-books]] and, in 2012, Doherty announced that his imprints would sell only [[DRM-free\|DRM-free]] e-books by July of that year. One year later, Tor stated that the removal of DRM had not harmed its e-book business, so they would continue selling them DRM-free.
In July 2018, Macmillan Publishers and Tor prompted a boycott spread across social media websites and library bulletin boards after they announced that Tor's e-books would no longer be made available for libraries to purchase and lend to borrowers, via digital distribution services such as [[OverDrive, Inc.\|OverDrive]], until four months after their initial publication date. The company cited the "direct and adverse impact" of electronic lending on retail eBook sales but suggested that the change was part of a "test program" and could be reevaluated.

## Accolades
Tor won the *Locus Magazine* poll for best science fiction publisher in 33 consecutive years from 1988 to 2020 inclusive.
In March 2014, *Worlds Without End* listed Tor as the second-most awarded and nominated publisher of science fiction, fantasy and horror books, after Gollancz. At that time, Tor had received 316 nominations and 54 wins for 723 published novels, written by 197 authors. In the following year, Tor surpassed Gollancz to become the top publisher on the list.
By March 2018, Tor's record had increased to 579 nominations and 111 wins, across 16 tracked awards given in the covered genres, with a total of 2,353 published novels written by 576 authors.
