**Shaor** was a young girl who became an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] before [[Raoden\|Raoden]] did. She was head of one of the city's three gangs, and her men were known for their wild brutality.
Upon seeing Shaor, Raoden recognized her as **Soine**, the daughter of Duke [[Telrii\|Telrii]] who had claimed she died of [[Dionia\|dionia]]. She had been bald and had worn a wig of golden hair. When entering [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] the priests had not bothered to remove the wig, thinking it was her real hair which had yet to fall out. Because of her supposedly golden hair, she was worshiped by men who had gone mad in Elantris.
When Raoden formed [[New Elantris\|New Elantris]] and Shaor's men were restricted of their food supply from new Elantrians, they killed Shaor and took her wig to Raoden, to express their new allegiance to him.
