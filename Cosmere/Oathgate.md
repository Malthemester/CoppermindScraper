## Functionality
Oathgates are [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] that manipulate the [[Surge\|Surge]] of [[Transportation\|Transportation]]. Together, they form a network of gateways with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] at its center, allowing for near-instantaneous travel between all corners of the world, and letting people unable to fly access to the tower-city itself. They can only be operated by someone wielding a living [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], such as a [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]], or with an [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]]. They require [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to work, although they can be made to use [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] through methods known to [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. Transportation of more than one person requires more Stormlight than what the Oathgate can normally hold in its ten [[Gemstone\|gemstone]] lanterns. The amount of Stormlight needed also depends on the Radiant, as those of higher oaths require less to activate the fabrial.
A Radiant can use their Shardblade to travel to the Cognitive Realm instead of another Oathgate.

### Structure and Operation
 by  Isaac Stewart  The Oathgate platform (purple) can be seen in the bottom left of the city, with a control chamber (yellow) rising from its center.
Oathgates can be found in many of the oldest cities on Roshar, such as [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] and [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]]. Each of them is composed of a large, perfectly circular platform, with a round control building in its center. The entire Oathgate is typically at a higher altitude than the rest of the city, with a wide ramp leading up to it. In some places, the ramp is also accompanied by a staircase, although that could be a later addition to the structure.

### Control building
The inside of the control building is richly decorated in murals both on the walls and the floor. The latter is divided into eleven sections, with the ten major ones each dedicated to one of the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]]. Between the first and tenth segments is a smaller, narrow section representing [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. The wall above has ten gemstone lamps hanging from it, with each lamp being enclosed in a metal lattice. Once they are infused, the floor begins to glow, and swirls of Stormlight start rising above the platform outside.
Along with the lamps, on the wall there is a plate of metal, shaped like a ten-pointed star, with a slot in its center. When a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] is inserted, the slot reshapes to fit its particular form. This occurs regardless of whether the Blade is living or dead, but only a living Blade or [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] can activate the keyhole, at which point is produces a low, vibrating sound. Once the Blade is in the keyhole, the keyhole can be moved along with the entire inner wall to align it with one of the eleven floor sections. There, the Radiant removes the Shardblade from the keyhole. With this, the contents of the control chamber, as well as anything on top of the platform, is swapped with the control chamber and the platform of the Oathgate in the desired location. The control building can also be swapped by itself, without transporting the platform, taking considerably less Stormlight than moving the entire platform.
The existence of eleven lamps in each Oathgate control chamber indicates that it might be possible to transport people directly between any two platforms. However, at the present each Oathgate is tied only to one other, connecting each of the ten ancient cities to Urithiru.

### Locking the Oathgate
Each Oathgate can be locked from either side. [[Odium\|Odium]] appears to have a way to break this lock, which could be tied to his corruption of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] [[Oathgate spren\|Oathgate spren]].
All but the Stormseat Oathgate have been locked up by the ancient Knights Radiant when they've abandoned the tower city. As such, over the millennia since the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], their purpose has been forgotten. Many of the Oathgate platforms are covered in buildings, such as the Grand Market in [[Azimir\|Azimir]], or the [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]] in Kholinar. Others, like the one in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], have been transformed into gardens and other religious or ceremonial structures.

### Shadesmar
For more information, see [[Oathgate spren\|Oathgate spren]].
In [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], an Oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. When possible -- for example, if the Oathgate is close to the sea shore in the Physical Realm -- the Oathgate is connected with the land by a bridge of matching color. The platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. One of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black.
Those two spren enable the Oathgate to function properly, and control who can travel, and where. They can be corrupted by [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], although so far, only the [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] spren have been compromised in this manner. This does not impact their ability to work with spren of the uncorrupted Oathgates.
In the past, the Oathgates have been capable of transporting people in and out of Shadesmar; however, at some point before their slumbering, the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] forbade the Oathgate spren from performing this service. As such, this function of the Oathgate was inaccessible. This being said, the spren corrupted by Sja-anat are not bound by this, and can transport people into Shadesmar, though it's uncertain if they can bring them back into the Physical Realm. Some Oathgate spren have since accepted the authority of the Stormfather in this matter, and once again allow travel to Shadesmar. This includes some of the spren at Urithiru, though others do not accept that the Stormfather has the authority to release them from their previous oaths to Honor himself.

## History
### Creation and the Heraldic Epochs
The origin of the Oathgates is unknown, although they may have been constructed during the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] epoch, as they link the capitals of those ancient nations. The Oathgate spren chose this transformation willingly. During [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], the city of Stormseat was destroyed in unexplained circumstances and its Oathgate was forgotten, although the mechanism remained intact.
Linking far-flung cities with one another and [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], the Oathgates were administered by members of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], whose [[Shardblade\|Blades]] served as the keys that allowed for their operation. Much trade and travel was done via the Oathgates, with the goods traded tariffed by the Radiants. Likewise, it seems as though trade with Shadesmar was conducted through the Oathgates.

### Closing of the Oathgates
As time went on, the tariffs imposed by the Knights Radiant became increasingly steep, which became a source of ire for those taxed. Later, just before Honor died, the Sibling spoke to the spren of the Oathgates, ordering them to stop allowing for Realmatic transition and only permitting Transportation between locations in the Physical Realm. Being bound by Honor, the Oathgate spren could not rescind this prohibition.
As the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] retreated from mankind and the city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] began to fail, the Radiants closed and locked the active Oathgates and abandoned the city. In the centuries since, the purpose of the structures was forgotten. Some became prime real estate for palaces and markets; others became religious monuments. During the [[Scouring of Aimia\|scouring of Aimia]], the Oathgate in [[Akinah\|Akinah]] was destroyed permanently -- or so it is believed. However, the Oathgate was instead hidden away, and a fake Oathgate platform constructed above it in an attempt to convince any visitors that the Oathgate no longer functioned. The real Oathgate is still functional, though still left locked.

### Rediscovery
Shortly before the arrival of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] began her research into [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], and alongside it, the Oathgates, hoping they could potentially allow her to find the city. In the course of her research, she successfully identified the locations of most of them, and may have even made an attempt to activate the Kholinar Oathgate, to no avail.
Following in Jasnah's footsteps, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] successfully located the [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]] Oathgate during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. She managed to activate it, transferring the Alethi forces safely to Urithiru. After the battle, this Oathgate was used to ferry people from the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to Urithiru.

### True Desolation
With the start of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the Oathgates became central to [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] overall strategy, as they allowed for quick transportation between various corners of the continent. However, many kingdoms were hesitant to allow the warlike [[Alethi\|Alethi]] direct access into their heartland.
King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] was the first to agree, ordering his Radiant, [[Malata\|Malata]], to activate the Oathgate. [[Thaylenah\|Thaylens]] were the next to agree, and Dalinar sent [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to open it from their side. Finally, the [[Azish\|Azish]] allowed access, after initially denying that the Oathgate was even functional.
At the same time, one of [[Odium\|Odium's]] [[Unmade\|Unmade]], [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], suceeded at corrupting the [[Oathgate spren\|Oathgate spren]] of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] to bend them to her master's will. The [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] later used this to invade Urithiru from Kholinar, as a distraction from the attack on [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. After [[Alethi\|Alethi]], assisted by [[Teft\|Teft]], managed to push them back, they sent reinforcements to Thaylen through its Oathgate to turn the tide of battle.

## Oathgate Locations
### Urithiru
There are ten Oathgate platforms on the edges of the grand plaza in front of Urithiru. Each Oathgate is connected to a location in each of the ten ancient [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]].

### Shattered Plains
The [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]] Oathgate is located in the city of [[Narak\|Narak]], or Stormseat, in the very center of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Back when the city was in its prime, the Oathgate was located on a round plaza in its south-western part. In the present, the platform forms its own plateau adjacent to Narak.
This Oathgate is the first to have been rediscovered and reactivated in the present day. It's found by [[Shallan\|Shallan]] during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], and used to transport the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] troops away from the field of battle before they can be killed in the confrontation between the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]]. Later, it becomes Urithiru's main connection to the outside world, with goods being brought through it from the Plains war camps into the tower-city.

### Alethkar

The [[Alethela\|Alethela]] Oathgate is located in the city of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], the capital of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. It's attached to the [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]] by a long covered bridge called the Sunwalk, and is technically part of the palatial complex. The Oathgate platform serves as the home of the palace [[Ardentia\|ardentia]], and is thus covered by numerous buildings. It's called the Monastery Dais, with the control chamber itself known as the Circle of Memories. The local ardents believe that the ten lamps in the Circle represent the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]], while the keyhole represents the need for the priesthood to ignore borders and boundaries.
During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], the platform becomes home to [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]], and as such is the location of the endless Revel organized by the [[Cult of Moments\|Cult of Moments]]. At the same time, another [[Unmade\|Unmade]], [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], corrupts its spren. When [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Azure\|Azure]] attempt to use the Oathgate, they are dumped into Shadesmar instead. While the Oathgate is later locked from Urithiru side after the news of Kholinar's fall reaches the tower, [[Malata\|Malata]] eventually unlocks it, letting the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] attack Urithiru thorugh it.

### Thaylenah
 by  Marie Seeberger  [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] Oathgate as seen from [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]
The [[Thalath\|Thalath]] Oathgate is located in the Thaylen capital, [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. It sits at the city's highest and east-most point, near the cliffs falling down into the sea. Standing high above the other buildings, it provides an excellent view of the entire city. A solitary path connects it to the Royal Ward. Notably, it's the only known Oathgate so far not to be located within the original borders of the ancient city it's connected to. In Shadesmar, it's connected to land by a long bridge.
The Oathgate's original purpose remained in the Thaylen cultural memory, with stories of a "portal of worlds" dazzling children to this day. However, the platform itself has been transformed into a sculpture garden. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Shallan\|Shallan]] fly to Thaylen City to unlock it, while [[Malata\|Malata]] does the same from Urithiru side, under [[Navani\|Navani's]] supervision. From then on out, it's frequently used to transport both people and cargo. It's particularly crucial in the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], as Kaladin and his group fight there in an attempt to return from Shadesmar, and the gate itself is used to transport reinforcements to help repel the [[Fused\|Fused]].

### Azir
The [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] Oathgate is located in the city of [[Azimir\|Azimir]] in [[Azir\|Azir]]. In the present day, it has been covered up by a bronze dome, with the interior serving as an indoor shopping district, known as the Grand Market. The control building itself is treated as a religious monument of some kind.
Once the Azish learn that the structure is an Oathgate, they close down the grand market and build an extensive wooden structure within, indended to funnel anyone coming out of the control chamber down a single, highly defensible path. Although they initially refuse to open the gate out of fear of the Blackthorn, they eventually allow [[Lift\|Lift]] to do so to let Dalinar visit their city. Dalinar intends to inform them that the entire platform can be swapped, rendering their defences meaningless, although it's unknown whether he ended up passing that information along.

### Jah Keved
The [[Valhav\|Valhav]] Oathgate is located in the city of [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], the capital of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. It stands on one of the highest of the grand terraces of the city. Alongside a ramp, a set of stairs leads up to the platform.
Like the other terraces in Vedenar, the Oathgate platform has been turned into a grand garden in the centuries since it's been locked. After [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] decides to ally with Dalinar, [[Malata\|Malata]] unlocks the Oathgate. The garden is then cleaned up, clearing the platform for full use.

### Akinah
The [[Aimia\|Aimia]] Oathgate is located in the city of [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. It was believed to have been destroyed during the [[Scouring of Aimia\|Scouring of Aimia]]. In actuality, it survived the Scouring, and fell under the protection of the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]], who had vowed to protect the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] which also resided on the island. In an attempt to conceal it, a building was built on top of the Oathgate platform and crem was allowed to cover it. A fake Oathgate building was built on top, containing a rusted mechanism, a decayed mural, and lacking a slot for a Shardblade.
When accompanying the *Wandersail* to Akinah, the team [[Navani Kholin\|Queen Navani]] sent had the secret mission of determining the location and state of the Akinah Oathgate. On arriving in Akinah, [[Lopen\|Lopen]] and [[Rushu\|Rushu]] found the fake Oathgate building exactly where they expected it. However, due to a number of odd coincidences, and a warning from [[Rysn\|Rysn]], they did not believe they had found the actual Oathgate. After finding a set of stairs, and cutting through the stone with a [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]], they discovered the actual Oathgate platform.
After Rysn brokered a peace agreement with the Sleepless, the *Wandersail* was allowed to leave Akinah with knowledge of the Oathgate. The Oathgate was not opened, however, since Navani wasn't certain yet if they want to expend the forces needed to secure the location.

### Other Oathgates
There are four other Oathgates that are not known to have been reactivated in the present day.

**Iri**: The [[Iri\|Iri]] Oathgate is located in their capital, [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]]. As the Iri leadership allied with [[Odium\|Odium]], the Oathgate is currently under their control. However, it remains locked.
**Rira**: The [[Rishir\|Rishir]] Oathgate is located in the capital of [[Rira (country)\|Rira]], [[Kurth\|Kurth]]. It's likely come under the control of Odium as the Iriali moved to conquer Rira -- something they've intended to do for a long time. Because the island that contains Kurth was located in the Silver Kingdom of Rishir and not Iri, the Kurth Oathgate may sometimes also be referred to as being in the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]].
**Babatharnam**: The [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]] Oathgate sits in the city of [[Panatham\|Panatham]] in [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]]. It has most likely been captured by the Iriali forces.
**Shinovar**: The [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]] Oathgate lies somewhere in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. It's exact location is unknown, as there are no cities in Shinovar marked on the world map.
