## Culture
Elisians have dark brown skin, dark eyes, and dark hair. They commonly prefer to take their tea with cinnamon.

## Politics
Relations between Elis and the [[Dynasty\|Dynasty]] are strained. Prince [[Gevalden\|Gevalden]] journeyed to [[Dayside\|Dayside]] hoping to gain the aid of the [[Sand mastery\|sand masters]] as a weapon to use against the empire.
Though the Darksider population in [[Lonzare\|Lonzare]] is quite diverse, there are apparently no Elisians living there. This is presumably due to the restrictions and control that the Dynasty has enforced, limiting travel between Darkside and Dayside.
