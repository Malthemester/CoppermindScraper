**MaiPon** is a sub-state of the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on the planet of [[Sel\|Sel]]. It was absorbed into the Rose Empire long prior to the events of [[The Emperor's Soul\|The Emperor's Soul]].
MaiPon is the homeland of [[Forgery\|Forgery]]. Because [[Investiture\|Investiture]] on Sel is concentrated in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], and thus dependent on geographic location, the power of a Forgery diminishes the further a forgery is from MaiPon, similar to how the Elantrian Aons function. All Forgeries include a lithograph resembling MaiPon on the reverse side of the stamp.
The MaiPon are descended from the same people group as the [[JinDo\|JinDo]]; they diverged long ago. They are commonly mistaken by other cultures as being identical. The MaiPon use chopsticks, known as [[MaiPon sticks\|MaiPon sticks]], as eating utensils. The sticks were later adopted in JinDo culture.

## Physical Traits
The MaiPon are short of stature, have dark brown skin and fine features.

## Religion
The early MaiPons worshiped meteors, which they call the souls of broken gods. These meteors would be carved to bring out the shape of the gods. It is believed that the history of carving was responsible for the invention and advancement of [[Forgery\|Forgery]]. [[Wan ShaiLu\|Wan ShaiLu]] is from MaiPon, and is a follower of the [[God Beyond\|God Beyond]]. It is unclear if the religion is common in MaiPon or unique to Shai.
