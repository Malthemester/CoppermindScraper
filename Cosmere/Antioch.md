The *Antioch* is one of the gunships in the [[Defiant (starship)\|Defiant]] fleet. The crew of the Antioch settled in [[Bountiful Cavern\|Bountiful Cavern]], nearby to [[Igneous Cavern\|Igneous]].
[[Kimmalyn\|Kimmalyn]] is the great-granddaughter of the Antioch's assistant quartermaster. At least some of the descendants of the Antioch crew have been employed as gunners at [[Alta Base\|Alta Base]], with those who perform well on the smaller anti-airship (AA) guns often being poached by the [[Defiant Defense Force\|DDF]] to become pilots.
To those raised outside of Bountiful Cavern, the descendants of the Antioch crew appear polite and mild mannered, however, they are good at subtle insults.
