>“*Enough wordplay, priest. I want promises. Are you saying that if we convert to Derethi, you will grant us greater holdings?*”
\-Ramear to Hrathen[1]


**Ramear** was a young, minor [[Arelene\|Arelene]] noble, the second son of an unimportant baron.

## Appearance & Personality
Ramear had the a hawkish face, and the strong nose of an Arelene.
Ramear seems to have been shrewd, but not overly loyal to his nation. He was intelligent enough to make sure that Hrathen was promising concrete benefits in exchange for his conversion to Shu-Dereth, but did not seem to care that in doing so he was betraying his own kingdom. Ramear was also very straightforward in his words and actions, directly asking what Hrathen was offering him.

## History
When [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] attempted to convert many of the young Arelene nobles to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], Ramear was among them. Ramear was amenable to conversion, but only if Hrathen was seriously promising rewards for his conversion. Following Hrathen's assurances that he would be rewarded, Ramear pondered Hrathen's offer. Hrathen believed that he had Ramear convinced, and planned to meet with him in private with a more solid promise.
