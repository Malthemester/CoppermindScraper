**Naget** is a resident of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] and has light hair. He is spindly, and is the tallest among his peers as a youth. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] cites 'Naget' as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' name, unlike his own. Naget is quite curious about whether a darkeyed person can really become [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] by winning a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].

## History
Naget comes from a farming family and was often tasked with removing [[Diggerworm\|diggerworms]] from the [[Lavis\|lavis]] fields near the town. He was among the group of youths who observed [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] picking up a weapon for the first time to fight [[Jost\|Jost]].
A few years later, he was present when [[Amaram\|Amaram]] came to Hearthstone to recruit soldiers for his army. He was no longer friendly with Kaladin at that point. He did not volunteer to join the army, and avoided conscription.
