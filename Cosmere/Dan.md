>“*Sorry Jax. Older brother’s entitlement. The oldest brother at the table always gets the saggiest piece of bacon. It’s pretty much the law.*”
\-Dan after stealing Jax’s piece of bacon.[1]

## Relationships
## Jax
Dan and Jax are very close, and still makes time to play with Jax despite being in college. Dan and Jax play fight over bacon. Dan knows that Jax likes the crispy slices, so he pretends to steal the soggy slices from Jax's plate and replaces them with crispy slices from his own. They also enjoy reenacting Civil War scenes together and tinkering with Civil War muskets. Dan isn’t afraid to be silly, and makes funny faces at Jax to make him laugh.
