>‚Äú*The lake that Fedik discovered is below us now‚ÄîI can see it from the ledge. It looks even more eerie from up here, with its glassy‚Äîalmost metallic‚Äîsheen. I almost wish I had let him take a sample of its waters.*‚Äù

**Ruin's Perpendicularity** was a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] of a reflective black liquid metal that belonged to the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Ruin\|Ruin]].
Ruin's Perpendicularity was a manifestation of his gathered consciousness, much like the darker [[Mist\|mists]].

## History
When [[Alendi\|Alendi]] and [[Rashek\|Rashek]] were climbing the [[Terris\|Terris]] mountains, to the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], they encountered Ruin's Perpendicularity. Alendi's companion, Fedik showed interest in the pool but Alendi refused to let him take samples. The [[Leras\|mist spirit]] stabbed Fedik shortly afterward, possibly due to his interest in the perpendicularity.
When Rashek took the power at the Well, he moved Ruin's Perpendicularity underground, where it remained at least up until the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. The perpendicularity was moved to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]], which is why the crystals produced [[Atium\|atium]]. The perpendicularity was used by [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] in an interplanetary trade system, which was upended when [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] destroyed the atium geodes, to which [[Hoid\|Hoid]] remarked "was fun to watch". The pools underneath the pits no longer exist following the Catacendre, however, it is unclear if this is related to Kelsier's destruction of the atium geodes or the combining of Ruin and Preservation into the shard Harmony.

## Trivia
[[Keep Lekal\|Keep Lekal]] had stained glass windows that depicted Ruin's Perpendicularity.
Before [[Brandon\|Brandon]] changed the location of the Well of Ascension to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], Vin and Elend discovered Ruin's Perpendicularity near the Well.
