## Geography
It is located at the eastern edge of the Basin. It lies north of the [[Irongate River\|Irongate River]] on a small tributary.

## Landmarks
The most notable feature of Corbeau is a nearby dam that creates a large reservoir near the foot of the [[Faleast Range\|Faleast Range]]. The reservoir provides water that irrigates one of the Basin's largest grain-producing regions.

## History
In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the dam in Corbeau was destroyed by a saboteur. This caused dozens of deaths and extensive flooding in the region, such that commodities markets predicted a spike in future grain costs due to the harvest being cut in half. The panic over the impending shortage of grain caused all food to suddenly increase in price, despite the fact that there were reserves that could be released. This added to the turmoil in Elendel, which was already reeling from a labor strike and the murder of [[Winsting Innate\|Winsting Innate]].
Governor [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate's]] promise to send aid to the region, supported by the [[Argien-Ohr Financial Circle\|Argien-Ohr Financial Circle]] and Lord [[Chapmot Heviers\|Chapmot Heviers]], was not well-received by the people that were suffering in Elendel.
Working on a hunch, [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] investigated the dam breaking incident. She and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] concluded that a local farmer named [[Johnst\|Johnst]] who had been tried and executed for sabotaging the dam was actually [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]].
