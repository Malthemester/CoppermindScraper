A **glyphward** is a [[Vorin\|Vorin]] prayer written in [[Glyphs\|glyphs]] with the intention of being burned.
Many scientifically-minded Rosharans deplore glyphwards as pure superstition, with some wondering why, if the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] is omniscient, he needs to have a prayer burned to him before he can aid someone. Nonetheless, they remain a minority, and for most Vorins, glyphwards are the main avenue for communicating with the Almighty. For them, if the prayer fails to be answered, it's simply His will.

## Creation
The job of making glyphwards usually goes to women, though a man who knows glyphs can do so as well. Regardless of who creates them, both men and women make use of them. In addition to being homemade, glyphwards can be purchased from [[Luckmerch\|luckmerches]] or apothecaries, the latter of which will often decorate their shops with them.
Usually, glyphwards are either drawn on long strips of paper or sewn into cloth, though at times they are drawn on surfaces with [[Burn ink\|burn ink]] and then set on fire to burn the prayer onto something. The drawing medium is usually ink, either red or black, but if it won't stick, chalk can also be used. The ink can be of various colors, such as red or black, while the cloth or paper are typically white. The glyphward can be as short as a single glyph, or as long as several glyphs strung together. They do take some skill to draw well and neatly, so a person who can draw glyphwards calligraphically well is considered to have an impressive ability.

## Use
After a glyphward is created, it is burned to send the soul of the prayer to the [[Almighty\|Almighty]], although glyphwards often make an additional appeal to one of the [[Herald\|Heralds]] or to the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] to make sure they are heard. Where the glyph is burned does not seem to matter - it can be in a specifically-designed brazier or censer, but it's just as valid on the ground. [[Ardent\|Ardents]] will also burn prayers to help the people they serve, or in exchange for a monetary offering. While the glyphward is burning, it's customary for all people concerned with its contents to bow their heads.
On some occasions, glyphwards are not burned right away, or at all. In some cases, one is simply sewn onto a person's sleeve in the event that they ever need it. Others are worn for protection or good fortune, without ever being burned, and some Rosharans will even get tattoos of glyphwards. Sometimes, a person will wear a white armband on their arm, and wrap an appropriate glyphward around it whenever they feel the need to have it.
When fire or flammable materials are not available, one may sketch a glyphward anyway, in hope that the Almighty will understand the supplicant's situation and accept the prayer. Instead of burning such a glyphward, the petitioner will then bow their head reverently for ten heartbeats. Less formal prayers may also be simply traced with a finger to ward off evil.

## Prayers
 by  Antti Hakosaari  [[Navani\|Navani]] burning a glyphward for thath, or Justice
Though they are universally believed to turn away evil, the prayers sent through glyphwards vary quite a bit. Among others, the following can be distinguished:


Often burned before an important action, such as a duel, or for blessings of luck or success. They typically contain glyphs specifying what the author wishes for in particular - for example, a glyphward made for a duel might be comprised of glyphs for "safety" and "glory", or just "excellence". Other prayers simply say "fortune", while some implore the Almighty with glyphs like "determination".


Burned to thank the [[Almighty\|Almighty]]. Can be burned after a strike of good fortune or when a difficult task is accomplished.


When a Vorin commits a sin of some kind, such as visiting the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]], they burn those glyphwards so that the Almighty may forgive them.


When someone dies, or is in danger of dying, their wife or daughters will create glyphwards to pray for their wellbeing either in this world or the next, with some people continuing to regularly burn glyphwards for their loved ones for years after they've died. In some cases, one may pray for protection of greater things, such as a nation.
For personal protection, a person can wear an unburned glyphward around their arm. It's also considered prudent to have a glyphward when being near a person of suspect moral character, such as a [[Stormwarden\|stormwarden]] or a [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]].


Some prayers are specific to particular events in a person's life.

A **bride's prayer** is a glyphward made of a glyphpair that a woman who is to be married sews onto her sleeve. After the engagement is formally announced, such a prayer is then removed and burned.
During a wedding, the bride will receive multiple glyphwards.
When a child is born, a number of glyphwards are burned, some containing the newborn's name.
