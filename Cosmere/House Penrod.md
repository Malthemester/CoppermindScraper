**House Penrod** is a noble house of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
It is among the less powerful houses during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. A member of the house, [[Ferson Penrod\|Ferson Penrod]], elects to remain in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] after the death of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], becoming one of the most influential noblemen in the government of the [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]] under King [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]], and eventually succeeding him to that title. After succumbing to the influence of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] Ferson kills himself, presumably the end of his house.

## Mansion Penrod
The house resides in a lavishly decorated mansion in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. The final vote to elect Ferson as king of Luthadel took place in the lounge of the mansion, and is large enough for the entire [[Luthadel Assembly\|Luthadel Assembly]] and a large number of guards to occupy whilst still feeling comfortable if crowded.
