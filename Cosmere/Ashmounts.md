The **Ashmounts** were enormous volcanoes in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].
They were created by [[Rashek\|Rashek]] during his initial contact with the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] to counteract his moving the planet too close to the sun. They are the source of the ashfalls which protect the planet from overheating by filling the air with massive clouds of ash. [[Aluminum\|Aluminum]] found on Scadrial came from the Ashmounts' craters.
While [[Ruin\|Ruin]] was free, he caused the Ashmounts to emit massively larger amounts of ash than previous times as part of his plan to destroy the world.
During [[Sazed\|Sazed's]] [[Ascension\|Ascension]], he restored Scadrial to its original orbit, eliminating the need for the ashmounts.
