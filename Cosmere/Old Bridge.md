**Old Bridge** is a bridge passing over a chasm in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].

## Appearance and Location
The Old Bridge is decrepit, and its planks are rickety. From a distance, the bridge looks like a large jawbone. The Old Bridge is located near [[Silence's waystop\|Silence's waystop]], not far from the hills where [[Theopolis\|Theopolis']] cave hideout is located. The ruins of the [[New Bridge\|New Bridge]] can still be seen from the Old Bridge in the chasm below.

## History
The Old Bridge was built by the people that lived in the Forests of Hell. After many years of use, the Old Bridge had become worn-out. The fortfolk took down the Old Bridge and replaced it with the New Bridge. After an unknown length of time, the New Bridge collapsed into the chasm it crossed. Homesteaders from the area, including [[Sebruki\|Sebruki's]] father, put the Old Bridge back up across the chasm.
[[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]] and her daughter [[William Ann\|William Ann]] crossed the Old Bridge while tracking the bounty hunter [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]]. As they returned with Chesterton's corpse, they were attacked by an injured [[Red Young\|Red Young]]. As Young held a knife to William Ann's throat, Theopolis shot him with a padded crossbow bolt, jarring his arm and accidentally drawing William Ann's blood. The nearby shades enraged and attacked the two of them, killing Red and severely injuring William Ann. Silence grabbed William Ann and carried her away from the bridge and back towards her waystop.
