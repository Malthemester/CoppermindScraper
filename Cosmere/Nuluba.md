**Nuluba** is a [[Varvax\|varvax]] pirate in the [[Belt\|belt]] of the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]]. She is a member of the [[Broadsider Faction\|Broadsider Faction]], working on the ground crew of [[Cutlass Flight\|Cutlass Flight]] alongside [[Maksim\|Maksim]].

## History
### Before Becoming a Pirate
Nuluba used to do customer analysis for the methane utility farms on [[Tuma\|Tuma]], in an irrelevant department. She had access to a lot of information, including population statistics for several planets. She became too curious about the data, and started asking too many questions. One of her jobs was looking at population statistics for species of “lesser intelligence”, who were deemed “aggressive”. The Superiority said that those species killed each other often through intraspecies murder, but Nuluba found that to not be the case. Nuluba started gathering proof, and was proud of her revolutionary research about how wrong their assumptions of “aggressive” species were. The Superiority threw her into the nowhere to keep her quiet, before she even got to see her mate, [[Vormel\|Vormel]], again. Afterward she joined with the pirates, in the Broadsider faction.
