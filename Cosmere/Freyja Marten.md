## Appearance and Personality
 by  Jill Andersen 
>“*Being a Defiant, isn’t just about our nationality. It’s always expressed as a mindset. ‘A true Defiant will think this way’ or ‘To be Defiant, you need to never back down,’ things like that. So, by their own logic, I can un-Defiant myself through personal choices.*”
\-FM explaining her world philosophy.[1]


FM is tall and skinny, around 185 centimeters in height. She has short blond hair, that she will sometimes pin back with glittery barrettes. FM has subtle Nordic physical features and shares a name with the  from Nordic mythology, indicating that she likely has Northern European heritage.
She has a slight accent which is associated with the people of the [[Deep caverns\|deep caverns]], and sometimes speaks in a formalized manner and proper tone. She is fashionable and and wears new and pristine clothing, courtesy of her family's wealth. Her regular [[DDF\|DDF]] uniform is well tailored, and she is able to look fashionable in a flight suit. When not in uniform she enjoys wearing feminine clothing such as blouses and skirts.
FM wears her emotions on her sleeve, is rather perceptive, and good at reading others. She is highly confident and unafraid to speak her mind, nor is she opposed to skirting or breaking the rules. This confidence, along with her refined and poised manner, makes FM appear older than the rest of her flight. She can be a perfectionist and dislikes her own shortcomings, even when she is doing better than her classmates. FM is more conservative when presented with risky choices, choosing to take the safer option. She may do this as a statement against the strong risk taking attitude promoted by the DDF.
She's is a people person who is often the instigator of group trips off the base, and also enjoys reading.

### Disputer
FM self-identifies as a [[Disputers\|Disputer]], a member of a movement that believes the [[Defiant League\|Defiant culture]] is becoming too jingoistic and authoritarian and that the dictatorship ruling [[Detritus\|Detritus]] has too much power. She's highly critical of military culture and worship of the [[First Citizen\|First Citizens]], and is quick to notice and challenge any hypocrisy from her peers. However, for all her misgivings she is supportive of the continued war against the [[Varvax\|Krell]] and works hard to become a pilot, despite feeling guilty for conforming to DDF militaristic society. She likes being asked about her beliefs, and will often complain that her flight members are too aggressive.

## Attributes and Abilities
>“*I figure these clowns will all get themselves killed, sir. I could probably win without any points at all.*”
\-FM feeling cocky during the light-lance game[15]


FM is highly knowledgeable about piloting and [[Starfighter\|starfighters]], having achieved the rank of pilot. She is best suited to smaller ships.
During flight school FM trains to pilot a [[Poco\|Poco]], perform aerial maneuvers, and use its weaponry. It is unknown as to whether she was required to sit the entrance exam or whether she is the descendant of a [[First Citizen\|First Citizen]] and was granted free admission. She may have had flight experience prior to joining the DDF, however lacked some of the background tactical knowledge known by her classmates.
FM is an excellent pilot who is highly skilled with a [[Light-lance\|light-lance]] and at maneuvers. She is good enough with [[Destructor\|destructors]] to be able to take down enemy units by brute force, although this weapon is not her strong suit. She has a tendency to be overly cautious, though this habit has lead her to greatly improve her precision in the cockpit. She is well suited as a [[Scout\|scout]], and for a time join their ranks after graduation, though was initially resistant to the idea. Prior to graduation, FM was also offered a place in [[Nightmare Flight\|Nightmare Flight]]. When [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] was reformed, she joined in a specialized capacity, likely flying an interceptor.
She comes from a highly-merited family, giving her a large degree of freedom, wealth, and influence.

## History
### Flight School
FM comes from one of the [[Deep caverns\|lower caves]] and a highly-merited family. After being accepted into [[Flight school\|flight school]], FM was placed in [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] under the tutelage of [[Cobb\|Cobb]]. She was roomed with the other female members of her flight, with the exception of [[Spensa\|Spensa]], who was denied accommodation.
Unlike many of the other members of Skyward Flight, FM successfully launched her [[Poco\|Poco]] during the first lesson run by Cobb. When the lesson was interrupted by a [[Varvax\|Krell]] attack, FM, along with the rest of Skyward Flight, were ordered to take to the sky and line up close to the battle to deceive the Krell into thinking there were more pilots ready to join the conflict. When the Krell began to chase [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]], FM expressed her surprise that they wouldn't attack the weakest members of the team first.

>“*I was raised Defiant. But I choose, now, to be what people down below call a Disputer—I raise objections about the way the war is being run. I think we should throw off the oppressive mantle of military government.*”
\-FM explaining the Disputers movement to Spensa[6]

FM played it safe during the ring game when Skyward Flight practiced their [[Light-lance\|light-lancing]]. She stuck to the easiest rings in the first two rounds and avoided the rings entirely on the final round, regardless of their difficulty.
A few days later, Skyward Flight was once again sent into battle against the Krell, this time fighting alongside full pilots. FM survived the battle, however, lost two of her other flightmates: [[Bim\|Bim]] and [[Morningtide\|Morningtide]].
FM approached Spensa the day after the battle to thank her for what she had said about Bim and Morningtide's death. As the two left the classroom for the day, FM introduced Spensa to the [[Disputers\|Disputer]] movement and explained how and why they opposed the Defiant leadership.
When the [[Shipyard\|shipyard]] began falling, the first time Skyward Flight had flown since Morningtide and Bim's deaths, FM, [[Arturo\|Arturo]], [[Hurl\|Hurl]], and [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]], ended up cut off from the other members of the Flight after they were attacked by Krell. Eventually the members of the Flight were able to regroup and joined [[Riptide Flight\|Riptide Flight]] as they returned back to base.

 by  Hitori Maron 
The next week, FM, along with [[Kimmalyn\|Kimmalyn]] and [[Hurl\|Hurl]], devised a plan to sneak Spensa into their dormitory for the evening. Following the day's lesson, FM and Kimmalyn retired to their bunks before dinner, claiming to be unwell. Kimmalyn lead Spensa to their room, meeting up with FM near the door and smuggled Spensa inside where she found blankets piled as a makeshift bed and food waiting for her. As the girls waited for Hurl to return, FM rambled about the militaristic Defiant culture, it's negative effects on their society, as well as the DDF's treatment of Spensa. She explained her motivations for why she had agreed to go to flight school when signed up by her parents and how she hoped it would give her a platform she could use to push for change.
After a later training session, Skyward Flight was called to action to help defend against a Krell attack. The flight took up position near one of [[Alta Base\|Alta's]] AA guns away from the main fight to wait as backup. After the flight was given the green light to engage, FM tried to fall in behind Kimmalyn to try provide assistance when she was swarmed by Krell. Despite her best efforts, the Krell kept locking onto Kimmalyn even after they were driven away, leading to FM picking up a tail of her own, however, before long it disengaged to instead target Spensa.
After the death of Hurl, FM, along with the other remaining members of Skyward Flight, were given a weeks leave in order to recover. During their week of leave, FM attempted to find Spensa, even asking Cobb if he knew the location of her cave, likely in an attempt to get the other girl to hangout with the members of Skyward Flight. After meeting up with Nedd, Arturo, and Kimmalyn, FM returned to the barrack's at Kimmalyn's request to retrieve a necklace the other girl had accidentally left behind when she quit the DDF. On her way, FM ran into Spensa and convinced the other girl to come with her to the restaurant where their flightmates had decided to meet.
Once the pair had arrived, FM left Spensa with the group while she went to order the other girl food and a drink, knowing that Spensa had eaten not much more than rat for the last few months. Although the meal was paid for by Arturo, FM studiously continued to bring Spensa food, in order to treat her friend who had not been able to access real meals since before flight school began. After returning the necklace she retrieved to Kimmalyn, FM and her friends spoke of Hurl, remembering their friend and reminiscing about their time in flight school. When Arturo's girlfriend, [[Bryn\|Bryn]], went to the bathroom, the members of Skyward Flight talked briefly about the strangeness of Krell tactics and the DDF's hesitancy to talk about these things.
Before the end of their temporary break, FM and Arturo went to see a [[Digball\|League]] game when they were given tickets by Nedd. Shortly after the end of Skyward Flight's medical leave, FM gained Spensa as a roommate, as the other woman had been given permission to live and take meals at Alta Base.
Several days later, FM and Spensa joined the other two cadet flights, [[Inkwell Flight\|Inkwell]] and [[Firestorm Flight\|Firestorm]], in the dining hall and discussed the possibility of the three cadet teams being joined into one. FM dismissed the idea of joining the scouts when it was suggested, as she believed it to be too much of the obvious choice.

>“*This is callsign: FM. Cloak died in the blast. There are…sir, there are three of us left in the scout flight. The others died in the fighting.*”
\-FM radioing in to Ironsides, during the Battle of Alta Second[2]

The week before graduation, the remaining members of Skyward Flight -- FM, Spensa, and Jorgen -- joined with [[Nightmare Flight\|Nightmare Flight]] during a routine debris tagging exercise. Thoroughly unimpressed by the dismissive attitude of some of Nightmare Flight's pilots, FM and Spensa gave a demonstration of their light-lancing skills after [[Bog\|Bog]] and [[Tunestone\|Tunestone]] attempted to condescendingly belittle the cadet's skills. During the mission, FM spotted the second half of the shipyard as it began descending from orbit. The group was set upon by Krell, who had been scouting the shipyard, and took up a defensive position, providing aid to Nightmare Flight members when they were swarmed by enemy ships. During the battle, FM was able to destroy at least one Krell ship by brute force, without needing to engage her [[IMP\|IMP]].

### Full Pilot
The next week, FM and Jorgen graduated from flight school, along with six other cadets. As the ceremony ended, the newly promoted pilots joined the rest of the Defiant fleet to go and defend the falling shipyard. FM joined the scouts for this mission, who were tasked with driving the Krell [[Lifebuster\|bomber]] away from the ship, even if it meant sacrificing Alta Base. When the lifebuster increased its speed, FM and the scouts were ordered to engage the Krell ship. They successfully destroyed the bomber, but at a great cost, with only three scouts, including FM, surviving the encounter. FM and the other two remaining scouts, joined with Riptide Flight and departed for Alta Base. Once reaching the battle near Alta, FM and Jorgen were ordered by Spensa to take down the bomber's shield, allowing Kimmalyn to detach the lifebuster from the enemy ship.
Following the battle, FM took up a specialized piloting role in the reformed Skyward Flight. She accompanied Spensa, Kimmalyn, and Sadie into battle against the Krell shortly before the arrival of the Superiority battleships.
She was part of the battle against the Krell when the delver and Spensa arrived, and tried and failed to save [[Lizard\|Lizard]]. After the battle, she discovered that Jorgen had found several [[Taynix\|taynix]], and she volunteered to help experiment on them.

### Experimenting with the Taynix
When FM volunteered to help with the taynix experiments, Jorgen assigned her the task of finding and retrieving any slugs that escaped. She eventually deduced that the yellow and blue taynix were hyperjumping out of their boxes. She quickly grew fond of the slugs, feeling protective of them. She named several of them, and encouraged Jorgen to do the same. When Jorgen picked up [[Boomslug\|Boomslug]], FM warned him that he was squeezing it to hard, but Jorgen ignored her. This resulted in Boomslug mentally exploding and inflicting dozens of shallow cuts across Jorgen’s face and arms.
After she visited Jorgen in the infirmary, FM and Jorgen were told that they would be the first to speak with [[Alanik\|Alanik]] since she fell unconscious. When Alanik woke up, she spoke with FM using a translator pin to translate. FM answered Alanik’s many questions, and Alanik urgently warned her not to trust the Superiority’s false peace. FM began to make headway, getting Alanik to trust her more, however, Jeshua and Cobb soon entered and Jeshua harshly demanded answers from Alanik and threatened to keep her captive. Alanik, angry, teleported away using her cytonic abilities.
Afterward, FM went to go find Rig and found him in the platform control room trying to find the FTL communicator. He subtly tried to get her to leave, and FM asked him what he had against her. Rig admitted that he liked FM, and they awkwardly changed the subject. They found the FTL communicator, a metal box like the one in M-Bot’s ship, and they realized that if they put a taynix in it, they could use it for hyperspeed communication.
They deduced through process of elimination that the purple and orange slugs were the ones that can be used as FTL communicators. FM theorized that maybe showing the slugs an image of a delver cytonically might trigger their abilities. Jorgen sent [[Gill\|Gill]] an image of the delvers, and Gill teleported away. Jorgen tried putting Gill in the special metal box that Rig crafted which was similar to the one that was part of [[M-Bot\|M-Bot]]’s machinery. He tried scaring Gill again while she was in the box, but nothing happened. They tried putting Happy in instead, and Happy teleported, this time taking Jorgen with him, with Jorgen appearing squeezed into a cubby, to the great amusement of FM and the others. They tried a similar experiment with FM and Jorgen in a fighter, with moderate success. Jorgen’s teleporting caught the attention of the Superiority however, and they moved their battleships into position to bombard the planet and prevent the Defiant peoples using the slugs to escape.
FM and Rig flew together in a Dulo and listened to music as they flew towards the battle. They had a taynix in the fighter with them, and Jorgen successfully teleported them close to the battleship’s main cannon. The cannon and its controls were shielded however, and FM was soon swarmed by Krell. She was forced to retreat, and Jorgen accidentally teleported her far back from the battle. The cannon began to fire, and Cobb called a full retreat, while at the same time the Engineering Corps managed to get the planetary shield up, blocking battleship’s shots. FM hid until the rest of Skyward Flight came and met up with her outside the shield. After giving the taynix time to settle down, they all touched wings and Jorgen teleported them inside the shield.
After making it back to Platform Prime, Rig and FM talked. Rig informed her that they were going to try using Fine to power the FTL communication device. As they walked, Rig and FM discussed what they feared, and FM admitted that she was afraid of dying in battle and ceasing to exist. They discussed their days in flight school and the taynix, before the topic turned to their experiments. Rig proposed that they try a different kind of experiment, and he and FM kissed briefly.

 by  Jill Andersen 
FM and Rig devised a new experiment, trying to train the slugs to teleport to a specific point, prompted by caviar. She called the target box "home", trying to get them to teleport there on command. She had moderate success, with some slugs being more motivated than others. They went to the command center, where Cobb had succeeded in creating a call to [[Cuna\|Cuna]] using a purple taynix as an FTL communicator. Cuna told them that they were trapped on the research station of [[Sunreach (station)\|Sunreach]] and under attack by about twenty Krell fighters. They promised their aid if the humans were able to come and rescue them. After the communication ended, Cobb went against Jeshua’s will and ordered Skyward Flight to depart immediately.

### Sunreach
FM hurried to her fighter, and Jorgen teleported all of Skyward FLight to Sunreach using the coordinates Cuna gave to him. They arrived at Sunreach, and were greeted by the sight of an enormous space monster, which Cuna identified as a [[Mammoth starpod\|mammoth starpod]]. A swarm of Krell ships flew out to meet them in combat, and the fighting began. During the battle, Jorgen's ship was destroyed, leaving FM to think he was dead. Gill appeared in FM’s fighter, then teleported her into Sunreach where she was reunited with Jorgen, who had teleported out of his fighter just in time. When Jorgen proposed that those in the station retreat and he would come back for Skyward Flight later, FM refused and told Jorgen to send the taynix images of Skyward Flight’s members. The slugs teleported away and returned with their flight members, before they all hyperjumped back to Starsight. After they arrived FM saw that a new shipment of caviar had arrived, the slugs’ favorite food. She cracked open several jars for the slugs, allowing them to eat their fill.

### Helping Alanik
When Alanik hyperjumped to Detritus to speak with Jorgen, she allowed FM to join them at Jorgen’s request. FM and Jorgen talk with Alanik, who figure out much about the taynix. Alanik wanted to form an alliance with the humans, and FM stayed with Alanik and talked to her as Jorgen went to talk to Command. Afterward they met with several of Detritus’ leaders, including Cobb and Jeshua. Jeshua decided to consult the National Assembly, and Alanik was given temporary quarters. A short time later, FM and Jorgen visited Alanik in her room, bringing food with them. Other members of Skyward Flight arrived, and FM and the others discussed free will and the Superiority with Alanik. Cobb came and told them that Alanik’s request had been denied, but heavily hinted that he wanted them to go anyway.

>“*Are you coming with us? Because if not, you should get back to Engineering. You don’t want to be associated with what we’re about to do.*”
\-FM to Rig[44]

Skyward Flight and Alanik went to their ships, FM giving Alanik a ship and briefly explaining the controls to her. Jeshua radioed them that they would be considered deserters if they left, but Skyward Flight left anyway, Alanik hyperjumping them to ReDawn. Jorgen ordered FM and a few others to fend off enemy pilots, while him, Alanik, and the rest went to capture the Unity shuttle that held Alanik’s allies captive. When the Unity pilots were freed, Alanik takes them to their ships to join the fight, but more Unity ships arrived. FM and the others fought, but were outnumbered. At Alanik’s suggestion, they retreated to the weaponized, automatic flying platform, [[Wandering Leaf\|Wandering Leaf]]. FM and the others in the flight used their taynix to hyperjump underneath the platform’s guns, bringing Independence pilots with them.
Skyward Flight and the Independence pilots met inside the platform, exchanging introductions. FM and the others listened to a Unity broadcast, which features [[Rinakin\|Rinakin]], Alanik’s captured friend, allying himself with Unity. After further discussion of what to do, FM wondered if the captured shuttle, which had belonged to the Superiority, had a cytonic inhibitor onboard. They checked, and FM found a blue and green inhibitor taynix inside. They explored the platform’s control room, but didn’t know how to work it. They decided they needed Rig’s expertise, so FM and Alanik hyperjumped to Detritus to retrieve him. They explained the situation, and asked him to come with them. Rig agreed, and warned them that Detritus’ leaders had started meeting with the Superiority, and might agree to the Superioirty’s demand to hand over their taynix, as well as their cytonics for “training”.
They decided to bring many of the taynix with them back to Wandering Leaf, in order to save them from the Superioirty. FM agreed with the plan, and Alanik summoned them to her with her abilities.

>“*The bigger plan may be to give the taynix to the Superiority! I’m not going to let them do that. And if you are, then you are not my flightleader.*”
\-FM arguing with Jorgen[49]

They escaped back to Wandering Leaf with the taynix, but Jorgen was furious that FM had taken the taynix. Jorgen said that she had robbed DDF pilots of valuable assets, but FM said that it was the right thing to do, defending her actions. They then tested the taynix functions of the platform, FM helping figure out how to use the taynix in the various systems.
After planning how to rescue Rinakin, they hyperjump Wandering Leaf to a point outside Tower, one of the biggest UrDail cities. With the enemy distracted, Alanik and Arturo went to rescue Rinakin while FM and Skyward Flight defended against the oncoming Independence pilots. FM and the others delayed the Independence pilots, trying to disrupt the UrDail cytonics who had formed a cytonic inhibitor around Wandering Leaf. A Superiority battleship arrived, armed with a planetary weapon that could destroy Tower. After Skyward Flight shot down a few enemy cytonics, Rig was able to hyperjump the platform right underneath the battleship, allowing the autoturrets to destroy it. A varvax cytonic hyperjumped onto Wandering Leaf, intending to seize the control room, and FM and several others converged on Wandering Leaf to try and help. Rig used Boomslug to defend himself however, Boomslug’s mindblades slicing through the cytonic’s armor and making it retreat. FM was relieved, running out of her ship to hug Rig.
With the Superiority battleship destroyed and with several of their cytonics defeated, the Unity pilots retreated. Cobb called them, and Jorgen gave him an update. When Cobb told them to return to Detritus with some of the UrDail officials, FM and Jorgen thought Cobb was acting suspicious. They decided that he was likely an imposter, having replaced Cobb at one of the peace meetings. They contacted Jeshua to tell her the news, but she didn’t believe them. Alanik contacted Gran-Gran, who was being handed over to the Superiority aboard a Superiority ship. FM and the others came up with a plan, deciding to hyperjump Wandering Leaf to Detritus, and board the Superioirty ship where Gran-Gran, the real Cobb, Jorgen’s parents, and many of the National Assembly leaders were.

### Back to Detritus
They hyperjumped to Detritus and Alanik and Jorgen went aboard the ship, FM staying behind on the platform with the rest of the flight in case they were needed to fly into combat. When Alanik and Jorgen failed, escaping back to Wandering Leaf as the ship exploded, FM tried to comfort Jorgen. Jorgen, angry and grieving after the loss of his parents, said that they were going down to Platform Prime, despite FM trying to get him to stop and think for a minute.
As Jorgen took Skyward Flight down to Platform Prime and stormed into Vice Admiral Stoff’s office, FM tried to reason with him and get him to stop and calm down, but had no success. FM was involved in the planning to find and retrieve Cobb and Gran-Gran, and then went with Skyward Flight to the [[Kitsen\|kitsen]] planet of [[Evershore (planet)\|Evershore]]

### Meeting with the Kitsen
>“*Other kitsen! I am a diplomatic representative from our people. We’re here to collect our lost friends and discuss an alliance. We’re not… invading anything, and we don’t mean to… sully your sands.*”
\-FM to the kitsen upon meeting Goro[54]


As Skyward Flight initially met with the kitsen outside the city of [[Dreamspring\|Dreamspring]], first meeting with [[Kauri\|Kauri]] and later with Goro, Jorgen put FM into the role of diplomat, and FM told the kitsen that the humans had no hostile intentions towards the kitsen.

>“*Stay here and maybe do some diplomacy.*”
\-Jorgen to FM before leaving to see Cobb and Gran-Gran[55]

As Jorgen, Alanik, and Kauri went to visit Cobb and Gran-Gran at the medical tent, FM and the other members of Skyward Flight stayed behind with the kitsen [[Hana\|Hana]], along with several other kitsen who were preparing a feast for the humans. FM insisted on having the flight help prepare the food, and so they did. FM went to the kitsen senate meeting with the others, listening in as the kitsen discussed the humans’ proposal of an alliance. After Jorgen disrupted the meeting by spontaneously throwing out mindblades into the crowd, giving a speech, and leaving, FM followed after him to the beach. She sat down with him and forced him to talk about his parent’s death. FM convinced Jorgen that their deaths weren’t his fault, easing the stress on his mind somewhat. While Jorgen practiced his mindblades and worked on the mystery of Gran Gran’s and Cobb’s coma, FM and many other members of Skyward Flight camped on the beach.

### The Battle for Evershore
When a Superiority carrier ship arrived and began an attack on the city of Dreamspring, FM and the others in the flight got into their fighters to join the fray. At Jorgen’s order, FM and the others protected the city itself, wanting to minimize civilian casualties and damage. As the battle progressed and the enemy gained reinforcements, FM and Jorgen both landed on the beach, then used Gill to hyperjump to Detritus.

>“*Forget for a minute about what Cobb ordered you to do. What do you think is the right thing to do?*”
\-FM to Jorgen about what to do at Evershore[58]

They met up with Rig, then went to Stoff’s quarters, waking him and explaining the situation. They got permission to bring Wandering Leaf to help, along with several DDF flights. Jorgen expressed doubt about his leadership and decision-making skills, but FM instilled him with more confidence, telling him to do what he thought was right. FM said a quick goodbye to Rig before returning to Evershore with Jorgen, taking Wandering Leaf and several DDF flights with them.

>“*But… we can see the closest island, off to the downward side. The ships are firing on the island. Shouldn’t we… help them?*”
\-FM showing concern for the other kitsen cities[60]

As more Superiority ships arrived, FM continued to defend Dreamspring, though when the Superiority arrived with a lifebuster, Jorgen ordered her and Sentry to oversee the evacuation of the kitsen from the city. FM took the kitsen senators to safety, using the medical transport they had brought for Cobb and Gran-Gran.

### Aftermath
When the Superiority lost the battle, largely due to Jorgen and Rig hyperjumping the entire planet of Detritus to a point outside Evershore, FM returned to the outskirts of Dreamspring, which had suffered from flooding. FM and Jorgen met with Stoff and Cobb, the latter of whom Jorgen had brought back to consciousness. Jorgen wasn’t going to say anything, but FM told Cobb the truth about Stoff, how he shoved all the responsibility onto Jorgen so that he wouldn’t get blamed if things went wrong. After reprimanding Stoff, Cobb had FM leave so him and Jorgen could talk alone.

>“*I hate the idea of the flight going out without me. I hate that I won’t be there to protect them.*”
\-FM to Jorgen about leaving active combat duty[63]

Jorgen talked to FM afterward, telling her of his promotion to Vice Admiral. She was happy for him, and Jorgen asked her if she would step down from active combat duty to be in charge of their diplomatic program. FM considered it and agreed, though she was reluctant to leave behind their flight and let them fly into battle without her.

## Relationships
### Spensa
>“*...You can’t help being a product of your environment! It’s not your fault you’re a bloodthirsty ball of aggression and destruction.*”
\-FM describing how she see's Spensa[1]


[[Spensa\|Spensa]] admires FM for her fashion sense and outward appearance, finding the other girl to epitomize beauty standards. FM's confidence can at times intimidate Spensa as it makes FM appear more mature and refined. Spensa is never quite able to get past her nervousness even after they have finished [[Flight school\|flight school]] though nonetheless, Spensa considers FM a close friend who truly understands her.
FM finds a lot of Spensa's bravado to come from indoctrination of the toxic and aggressive culture promoted by the [[Defiant League\|Defiants]], however, appreciates the sincerity behind Spensa's attitude, particularly after the deaths of [[Bim\|Bim]] and [[Morningtide\|Morningtide]]. She doesn't blame Spensa for her attitude, believing it to be caused by the culture they live in - a sentiment that Spensa does not agree with and struggles to understand. FM is dismissive of Spensa's concerns about experiencing fear, likely because she does not understand Spensa's underlying fears about being a coward. Following the revelation that Spensa's father was [[Zeen Nightshade\|Zeen Nightshade]], FM began acting more cautious around Spensa, although it is unclear if this was because of her parentage or her temper.
FM worries about Spensa, particularly after the death of [[Hurl\|Hurl]], and takes it upon herself to regularly check in with her flight-mate. The departure of [[Arturo\|Arturo]] set off worries in Spensa, that FM might also be removed from [[Flight school\|flight school]] as, like Arturo, her parents are influential and wealthy. After being dismissed from the DDF, Spensa avoided all of her former flightmates, including FM.

### Rodge
>“*You will not tell her I said those things. She probably doesn’t even remember who I am....Does she?*”
\-Rodge talking to Spensa after admitting he likes FM[66]


[[Rodge\|Rodge]] has a crush on FM and thinks she is smart, cute, and has nice eyes. Spensa, while playing matchmaker, asks FM about her dating preferences to see whether she would be interested in someone like Rodge, although her attempts to find out information do not go very far.
FM thinks Rodge is cute, and wanted to get to know him better. Because of his shyness, though, Rodge felt very awkward around her and she thought he didn't like her, as he never looked her in the eye and rarely spoke to her.
After she confronts him, asking what his problem is, he confesses that he has a crush on her, and apologizes for making her feel that he didn't like her. FM, though she finds Rodge attractive, is worried about getting into a relationship because of the danger of her life as a pilot, knowing that any day, she could fly away and not come back. She tells Rodge she doesn't know if she likes anyone, and he takes it as a gentle letdown.
After this, Rodge is able to talk to FM more and treats her more normally, and makes her heart skip when he smiles at her. When the Superiority prepares to fire on Detrius with planetary weapons, FM and Rodge ride together in the [[Dulo\|Dulo]]. When the planetary shield goes up, they, the rest of Skyward flight, and a couple of other pilots are trapped outside until they rendezvous to hyperjump back inside. During the wait, FM tells Rodge that she's more sure about her feelings now, and takes his hand, much to his delight. After the battle, FM is stressed and worrying about the [[Taynix\|taynix]]. Rodge talks to her, and helps her feel better. She kisses him after he helps her up. They work together to experiment with the taynix, and Rodge agrees with FM in that the slugs are alive and more than just tools. Rodge is worried when FM leaves on missions, and FM is worried about hurting him if she doesn't come back, but she decides that there's little point in staying alive if one doesn't have much to live for. With this thought, she decides to continue her relationship with Rodge despite the danger of her situation.
FM and Rodge used their taynix to meet quietly, because they weren't ready to tell everyone that they were dating yet. They are close, and FM enjoys helping Rodge with his engineering projects, or at least watching him work.

### Nedd
[[Nedd Strong\|Nedd]] had a crush on FM. They have a playful relationship, often exchanging friendly insults and joking comments. Nedd had hoped to celebrate with FM after her graduation, and was disappointed that she had immediately been sent on a DDF mission. While they were on leave, he cornered FM and asked her out, but she told him she'd rather just be friends. He took it well, though after that he acted overly friendly in an effort to not make their friendship awkward, though for FM, it had the opposite effect. This slightly exasperated FM, who tried to avoid that in the first place by not directly confronting Nedd.
FM seems to perceive Nedd as rather socially oblivious, as he didn't pick up on her hints that she wasn't interested in him.
