## Geography
It is one of the more southern nations in the northern continent, separate from [[Sycla\|Sycla]] by the [[Sea of Fjorden\|Sea of Fjorden]].
There are passes that lead to the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]]. 

## Culture
The capital of Teod is [[Teoras\|Teoras]], and its ruler is King [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]].
Teod's martial strength exists mainly in the form of its navy, which dominates the northern sea, protecting Teod's borders from the Fjordell Empire.
Unlike the rest of the northern continent, Teod is within Opelon's cultural sphere of influence. For example, the nation's state religion is [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]], which originated in Opelon. The Teo people are also of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] descent and are therefore related to the [[Arelene\|Arelene]] and [[Dula\|Dula]] people of Opelon.

## History
After the previous ruler died, [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]] took the throne against the rightful line of succession, which would have led his brother [[Kiin\|Kiin]] ascending.
With the rise of the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]] putting pressure on Teod and [[Arelon\|Arelon]], kings Eventeo and [[Iadon\|Iadon]] attempted to strengthen their alliance by marrying their children [[Raoden\|Raoden]] and [[Sarene\|Sarene]]. The deal eventually fell through after Raoden succumbed to the [[Reod\|Reod]], and some trickery by [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] lead to Eventeo converting to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]].

## Trivia
In the first published edition of *Elantris*, the term "Teoish" was used to describe things originating from the nation of Teod. This was changed in the tenth anniversary edition of *Elantris* such that "Teo" is now used as the nation's demonym and adjectival form.
