>“*This is not a good time. Our troops still haven’t recovered from those Vendis raids last fall, and with the fires in the granary this winter...*”
\-Yarda, explaining Idris's war readiness.[1]

**Vendis** is a place or culture on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] circa 327. General [[Yarda\|Yarda]] mentions to King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] of [[Idris\|Idris]] that the Vendis raids inflicted damage on the Idrian army, and the Idrians still had not recovered.
Judging from the similarity of its name to Idris, Vendis could be a place in the mountains near Idris, and often raided the Idrians. However, it could also be a group of people, rather than a place or country.
