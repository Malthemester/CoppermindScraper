## Attributes and Abilities
Revilar is a competent businessman and a relatively skilled politician. As a landowner, he is of at least the sixth [[Dahn\|dahn]] and is considered wealthy in his princedom. His house has a good reputation and he is able to hire [[Master-servant\|master-servants]].
He has at least one son, who is skilled at dueling.

## History
During his youth, Revilar lost his nose during a duel with an unknown combatant.

### c. 1170
In 1169 and early 1170, Revilar intensified his efforts to curry favor with Highprince [[Valam\|Valam]]. He successfully worked to improve the output of the princedom's textile industry. Additionally, his son's skill as a duelist drew attention from the highprince. Valam personally visited Revilar's estates, showing his approval.
In [[Midpeace\|Midpeace]] of 1170, Revilar attended [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] on the Davar grounds. His son was scheduled to participate in the dueling contests during the fair. During the festivities, Revilar confronted Lin and coerced him into taking a financially outrageous business deal which involved Lin selling [[Breachtree\|breachtree]] cotton and raw [[Shum (plant)\|shum]] to Revilar below cost. Revilar would then arrange for it to be taken to market for the final sale. Lin showed open disdain for Revilar and initially resisted the trade. However, Revilar revealed the extent to which Valam had recently shown him favor, even inviting Revilar to visit him in [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] every month. He also reminded Lin that House Davar had fallen into disrepute due to the rumors surrounding the death of [[Shallan's mother\|Shallan's mother]], and it was also in financial decline. Lin was enraged, but ultimately accepted the proposal since he was desperate for political allies.

## Relationships
### Lin Davar
Lin and Revilar are two of ten men of similar ranking that serve under Highprince Valam. They are political rivals and also seem to personally dislike one another. Lin is jealous of Revilar's success, including his ability to employ master-servants; the Davar household was unable to hire them due to Lin's reputation. Revilar does not respect Lin and those in his retinue also disapprove of him. Despite their lands bordering one another, the two men had no business relationship until Revilar coerced Lin into selling him commodities at a steep discount.
