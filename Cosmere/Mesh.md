**Mesh** is a squadleader in Brightlord [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army.

## History
During one of Amaram's battles, [[Kaladin Stormblessed\|Kaladin Stormblessed]] ended up reinforcing Mesh's squad while trying to find his brother, [[Tien\|Tien]]. Mesh had lost a lot of men in that battle and was having difficulty holding his position. The enemy army was coming in a pincer formation at his squad from the south and the east, but he and his neighboring squadleader, [[Varth\|Varth]], were told by a messenger that they were to only hold against an east assault. Kaladin caught sight of Tien in Varth's squad and abandoned his position in the line just as the enemy troops reached them. Already lacking in reinforcements, this additional weakness in the lines caused Mesh's squad to crumple under the enemy assault, falling apart and losing their discipline immediately. It is unknown if Mesh himself survived the battle.
