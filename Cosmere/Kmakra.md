>“* Kmakra and Molinar, the true gemstones of my life.*”
\- Excerpt from drawer 12-15, ruby, in the Urithiru gem archive[1]


**Kmakra** is a child mentioned in one of the records in the [[Urithiru gem archive\|Urithiru gem archive]]. It seems likely that Kmakra was ethnically [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] due to their name, or part-Thaylen.
Their mother was planning to depart [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and was given the opportunity to leave a message. She chose to leave a record of her family. A ruby was used to record the message, so she was likely a [[Dustbringer\|Dustbringer]].
She felt Kmakra, as well as Kmakra's sibling [[Molinar\|Molinar]], were the true gemstones of her life.
