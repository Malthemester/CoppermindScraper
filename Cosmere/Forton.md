## Appearance & Personality
Forton had a mouse-like face with large ears. He also had a persistent cough, because of various substances that Forton liked to smoke. These same substances also caused Forton to be absolutely content with his life.
Forton was a man of contradictions. While he was a devote follower of the [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jeskeri Mysteries]] and was considered a mystic of sorts in his town, he also professed to be staunchly [[Derethi\|Derethi]]. His knowledge of Derethi doctrine was impressive, but still lacking in some areas, such as his belief that [[Gyorn\|gyorns]] could simply pray to Jaddeth to have their words directed to anyone with a seon.
Forton, like many in Hrovell, spoke a dialect of [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] that was thick, harsh, and rough sounding.

## Attributes and Abilities
Forton was an apothecary of unparalleled skill. In fact, Forton's potions are [[Investiture\|Invested]], likely drawing on the power of the [[Dor\|Dor]]. It is unknown how exactly Forton creates these potions, where he learned his skills, or whether there are other people who can also make these potions. There was no one in [[Opelon\|Opelon]] who could match Forton's skills in making antidotes, elixirs, potions, and poisons. He was so skilled and such a useful tool that Hrathen overlooked the fact that he was a heathen.
Forton was also bound to a seon, allowing for instantaneous communication across the world.

## History
Years before the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]], Hrathen was poisoned by a political enemy with a poison that had no known antidote. Hrathen went to Forton for help and was cured. Hrathen kept in touch with Forton via [[Seon\|seon]], ordering potions, antidotes, and the like. While attempting to convert [[Arelon\|Arelon]] to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], Hrathen commissioned a potion that could simulate the appearance of an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] who had been taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] after the [[Reod\|Reod]]. Hrathen used this potion both on himself and [[Sarene\|Sarene]] to create the appearance of a miracle healing and gain leverage on [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]], Sarene's father and king of [[Teod\|Teod]].
