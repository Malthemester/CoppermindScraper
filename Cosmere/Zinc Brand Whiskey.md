 ([[Zinc\|Zinc]]) **Brand Whiskey** is a brand of whiskey on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] that was advertised in *The New Ascendancy* broadsheet. It is distilled exclusively in the Outer Cities and is not sold in [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. One of its primary selling points is that it does not pass through Elendel and is therefore not taxed by its government. This allows residents of the Outer Cities, among whom dislike of the taxation and oppression of Elendel is common, to purchase the drink knowing that their purchase will not be supporting that regime.
