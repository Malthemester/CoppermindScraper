A **reality badge** is a badge used by police officers when investigating in a [[Snapshot (event)\|Snapshot]]. These badges instantly convince dupes that they are fake, allowing the investigating officers to go about their business. To anyone real, it just looks like a normal badge.

## Function
Reality badges work by showing a dupe their entire life in a single instant. This instantly convinces them that they are fake. Reactions to being shown the reality badge vary based on the individual and can range from breaking down crying to becoming a homicidal maniac.
