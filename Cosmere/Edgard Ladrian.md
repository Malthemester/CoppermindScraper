## Appearance and Personality
 by  Laura MacMahon 
He is commonly described as "portly", though he has lost weight at various points. He wears extremely colorful clothes, and has black hair and a mustache. Breeze is often lazy, and delights in getting people to do things he doesn‚Äôt want to do, such as fetching him drinks.

## Attributes and Abilities
He is a [[Brass\|Soother]], who subtly Soothes everyone he comes across. This leads him to be mistrusted by many people. They are reluctant to do anything for him, as they are worried he might be Soothing them. He is believed by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and many of his crew to be one of the most skilled Soothers on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He helps to teach [[Vin\|Vin]] some of the more in-depth aspects of Soothing. He has a refined and intricate control over his Soothing, and is skilled at Soothing people without them noticing. He does this to Vin on a few occasions. He could influence several hundred people at once.

## History
Breeze was invited by Dockson to attend Kelsier's Meeting in Cammon's old Lair. He and Ham arrived around the same time and met [[Vin\|Vin]]. She got angry when she realized he was Soothing her. When Kelsier explained his plan Breeze Joined his Crew.

 by  Elisgardor 
In the crew, Breeze is often used by Kelsier to interact with nobles, and he has several aliases among the different noble families. During the overthrow of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], he operated with a team of soothers and rioters to recruit skaa for their army. During one of the meetings he taught Vin how to use zinc and brass. After the Rebellion when Elend becomes king, Breeze helps him write his speeches, as he is very skilled with persuasion, even without using his Soothing. At some point he left to spy on [[Ashweather Cett\|Cett]]. He begun a relationship with [[Allrianne Cett\|Allrianne Cett]] while he was in the service of Lord Cett. When Cett attempted to invade [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] he reunited with the Crew. He tries to hide his relationship with Allrianne because of the huge age difference between them, but everyone finds out when she arrives begging for protection. It is later discovered that she is a [[Zinc\|Rioter]], and is Rioting Breeze's emotions. Breeze often Soothes members of the crew to make them more confident, although he does not want anybody to know about this because he would lose his reputation for being uncaring.

## Relationships
