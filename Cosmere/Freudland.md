**Freudland** is a master watchmaker.
One of his pocket watches was worn by King [[Gregory III\|Gregory III]], and it helped protect the king from the wild [[Chalkling\|chalklings]] he discovered.

>“*It is odd, then, that something man-made should have played such an important part in the discovery of Rithmatics. If His Majesty hadn’t been carrying one of Master Freudland’s new-style pocket watches, perhaps none of this would have ever occurred, and man might have fallen to the wild chalklings.*”
\- A quote from the journal of Adam Makings
