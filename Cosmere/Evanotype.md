An **evanotype** is a photograph created through an early form of image capture technique invented on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
Evanotypes are captured using special cameras. Early evanotype cameras were large and required the subject to stand still. The camera used by the [[Kandra\|kandra]] explorer [[ReLuur\|ReLuur]] was a newer model that could take action pictures and was small enough to fit in ReLuur's pack. It is not clear when evanotypes were invented, but by around 330 [[Catacendre\|PC]] they were relatively common, as people living in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] had access to them.

## Evanoscope
In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], a new device known as an **evanoscope** was developed. It was an image projector that used lights to enlarge and display an evanotype on a given surface, such as a wall. Both [[Wayne\|Wayne]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] were shocked to see an evanoscope in action, and [[VenDell\|VenDell]] believed that they would be quite popular.
[[Harmony\|Harmony]] let slip to the kandra the concept of moving images, although he refused to expand on the subject.

## Trivia
Evanotypes are presumably inspired by real-world photographic processes invented in the 19th century (such as the , , and ) that use metals and chemicals to create monochromatic images.
