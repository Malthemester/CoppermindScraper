A **savant** is someone who has used an [[Investiture\|Investiture]]-related ability so much that it has changed their physiology; at least [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], and [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] can lead to savants. The process involves one's spirit becoming infused with Investiture, causing changes in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. Savantism brings a person closer to the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]].

## Allomantic savant
An Allomancer who has flared their metal for a long time can become a savant. Generally, savantism gives the Allomancer more blunt power and sometimes grants additional special effects. It is dangerous and harmful to the body. The Allomancer might rely so much on or get so accustomed to the metal that when they extinguish the metal, they experience serious backfire effects.
With most metals, the effects are quite small. Seekers, for example, often become savants without being aware of it, granting them a boost to the range of their abilities. However, some metals warp the body of savants much more. [[Tin\|Tin]] savants experience such magnification of their senses that they can become incapacitated by bright light or loud sounds. [[Pewter\|Pewter]] [[Misting\|Mistings]] often die before becoming savants, as they feel neither pain nor exhaustion to any great extent and therefore may ignore wounds that later prove fatal. Pewter savants heal quickly, though not as fast as someone tapping health from a goldmind.
[[Spook\|Spook]] is an Allomantic savant. He flares his tin for so long that he can sense things as minute as the wind of a sword's passing. However, his senses are so enhanced that any light is too bright for him, forcing him to wear a blindfold, and he keeps his ears stuffed with wool to block out noises.
If someone were able to burn the amount of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] needed to become a savant with the metal, they would ascend and become the holder of Preservation, similar to what happens when one consumes the mists. This is due to the nature of the metal as the condensed power of Preservation.

## Feruchemical savant
Since Feruchemy doesn't draw from an external power, it is very difficult to become a savant. If the Feruchemist is able to [[Compound\|Compound]] and draw power from an outside source they could become one.

## Surgebinding savant
Every [[Surge\|Surge]] can cause a [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinder]] to become a savant.

### Soulcasting savant
Soulcasting savants begin to take on the physical characteristics of the substances that they produce with Soulcasting. For example, ardents responsible for construction on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] begin to look like stone or crystal, [[Kaza\|Kaza's]] body starts turning into smoke, and [[Ithi\|Ithi]] and her sister have vines growing under their skin in part from constantly producing grain during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]. Both Surgebinder Soulcasters and users of Soulcaster [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] can become savants, though the effects are much less pronounced for Surgebinders, as the [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] offers some protection.

## Trivia
Savants look different in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] compared to a regular human.
The extra abilities gained by a savant cannot be transferred through [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]].
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] ability to create a "steel bubble" to deflect metal moving around him was originally intended to be the result of him being a savant in the [[Resonance\|resonance]] between his Allomantic steel and Feruchemical iron. Brandon later backed up on that, as he realized Wax was not manifesting the usual consequences of savantism.
