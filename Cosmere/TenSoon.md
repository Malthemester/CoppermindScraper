## History

When Elend Venture returns from one of the balls, he sees his father, Straff Venture, in his office, speaking to TenSoon. At the time, TenSoon is wearing the body of a servant from House Hasting.
His [[Contract\|Contract]] was with Lord [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]], and was used by [[Zane Venture\|Zane Venture]] to imitate [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]], [[Vin\|Vin's]] kandra accomplice. He also took OreSeur's Blessing, the Blessing of Potency, after killing him. TenSoon retained possession of [[Kelsier's bones\|Kelsier's bones]] after OreSeur's death. He wore the bones of a  whilst in her 'service', and came to like them. He betrayed the Contract by telling Vin the secrets of the kandra, and by disobeying his master, Zane. He returned to [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] and was imprisoned with [[ChanGaar\|ChanGaar]] and tried for his crimes. He rebelled and escaped to help Vin fulfil the prophecies of the [[Hero of Ages\|Hero of Ages]].
He encountered [[Sazed\|Sazed]] before this and imparted some knowledge onto him, who he saw as the "Announcer." He then took Sazed to the homeland of the Kandra.
After failing to make it back to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] and despairing, he turned back around and returned to the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] in time to help free [[Sazed\|Sazed]] from the treachery of the Second Generation. After this he took the true body of a fifth generation guard and once again played the part of another kandra in order to fool [[KanPaar\|KanPaar]]. His ruse succeeded until [[Ruin\|Ruin]] took direct control of his body and began to choke [[Sazed\|Sazed]] to death. This then forced him to carry out the [[Resolution\|Resolution]] and remove his own blessings, thus turning back into a [[Mistwraith\|Mistwraith]].

### Post Catacendre
His actions in the events of the Catacendre came to be known by the kandra as the "Remarked Duplicity." He is known among Kandra for being the best impersonator and for the speed at which he can change bones. TenSoon has degraded memories from the time right before his spikes were removed.

[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] met TenSoon who was imitating Captain [[Brettin\|Brettin]] after the arrest of [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]]. Brettin was killed in an unrelated matter, so [[Harmony\|Harmony]] had TenSoon impersonate him. TenSoon did not have the opportunity to observe Brettin prior to his death, and so it was an imperfect impersonation. Those who knew Brettin could detect something off about him. TenSoon used Brettin's bones to submit a backdated request to the Senate for a citywide deputized forbearance for Wax. This freed Wax from any charges incurred during his investigation of the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]], as well as granted him powers of investigation and arrest. He informed Wax of this action after Wax and Marasi's final confrontation with Miles. Brettin, still being impersonated by TenSoon, retired after Miles' execution, and presumably his bones were laid to rest.
During the hunt for [[Paalm\|Paalm]] he met Wax to guide him to the Kandra Homeland in an attempt to find more information on Bleeder. He first appeared in the form of a very large wolfhound and changed into a human form, then back to the wolfhound. Wax observed him change bones in mere seconds. He helped Wax escape from [[Chimera\|chimeras]] through the remnants of the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]].

## Trivia
TenSoon's wolfhound form is that of a large, wolf-like dog -- not an Irish Wolfhound.
