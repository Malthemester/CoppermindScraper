**Meala** is the head maid of [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] palace in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is young and thin, and very polite. Sarene thinks she looks more like an accountant than a maid.

## History
[[Sarene\|Sarene]] questioned Meala about why her room was not being cleaned regularly. Meala told her that maids had been suddenly disappearing for no apparent reason. This was one of several factors that made Sarene suspicious of Iadon, and ultimately led to her discovery that he was a follower of the [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jeskeri Mysteries]] and had been ritually sacrificing the missing maids.
