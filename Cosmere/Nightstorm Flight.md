Both of them fly [[Sigo\|Sigo]]-class fighters suggesting that this ship may be used by all members in this squad. Their fighters are painted blue, which helps distinguish which flight they are.
Nightstorm Flight participated in the fight over the first falling shipyard. During the battle, [[Vent (Skyward)\|Vent]] and his brother flew into the shipyard and unfortunately died while inside.
Nightstorm Flight was present in the battle against the Superiority when [[Brade\|Brade]] summoned a [[Delver\|delver]] outside Detritus.
