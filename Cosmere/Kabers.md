**Kabers** is a card game on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that involves wagering.
[[Yalb\|Yalb]] played kabers with four guards outside of the [[Palanaeum\|Palanaeum]] in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] while waiting for [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to finish her meeting with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]]. He won around eighty [[Sphere\|chips]] of various gemstones from the guards by cheating, despite the fact that they were watching him with suspicion.

>“*[Cheating's] what they right expected from me. Watched me like handlers of poisonous skyeels, they did. The game wasn't about the cards—it was about them trying to figure how I was cheating and me trying to figure how to keep them from hauling me off. I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you hadn't arrived!*”
\- Yalb discussing the ethics of his cheating with Shallan[1]
