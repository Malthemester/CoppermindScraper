**Emul** is a [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] kingdom located in southwestern [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]]. The citizens of Emul are referred to as Emuli. Traditionally a rather independent kingdom, the Desolation and war with [[Tukar\|Tukar]] has greatly weakened Emul and left it dependent on others for aid.

## Geography
Emul is located in the southeastern portion of the Makabaki basin, which is itself located within southwestern Roshar. It is a mostly landlocked country, bordering an inlet of the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] along its western border. [[Tukar\|Tukar]] is located to the south, [[Marat\|Marat]] to the southeast, [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] to the northwest, and [[Azir\|Azir]] to the north. The eastern border of Emul borders a mountain range that contains the [[Valley\|Valley]], home of the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]], and a pass to [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]]. The city of Urithiru is located in these eastern mountains. The capital city of Emul, Sesemalex Dar, is located on the western coast near the border with Tukar. This city is the best port in Emul and rich in trade. Following the war with Tukar, the kingdom was broken into pieces, although they seem to have retained control of the capital.

## History
### Founding
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Era, Emul was a part of the kingdom Makabakam. Some time after the collapse of Makabakam, Emul formed its own kingdom with the [[Dawncity\|Dawncity]] of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]] as its capital. It remained technically subject to the [[Azir\|Azish]] Empire but in reality often acted independently.

### War and Famine (~1153-1174)
A few decades before 1173, Emul was struck by a [[Lurnip\|lurnip]] famine, and widespread starvation ensued. [[Ashno\|Ashno of Sages]] served for a time as one of the greatest Emuli Primes but was replaced by [[Vexil\|Vexil the Wise]]. Emul and Tukar had a longstanding feud over the city of Sesemalex Dar, the Emuli capital. The religious significance of the city, as well as its status as an excellent port, made Sesemalex Dar a valuable prize. Since 1167, the two kingdoms have been embroiled in the [[Eighty's War\|Eighty's War]], the most recent iteration of a religious conflict over control of the city. The Emuli remained in control, but as the war pressed on the fighting went increasingly poorly for the Emuli, with refugees fleeing into the neighboring Tukar.

### True Desolation (1174-present)
>‚Äú*We must reclaim my nation from the hands of the traitor parshmen; then we must conquer Tukar. It is completely unreasonable to allow this insane man, who claims to be a god, to continue bereaving the glorious Azish Empire.*‚Äù
\-Vexil trying to convince coalition leaders to reclaim Emul[2]


In 1174 after the rediscovery of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] sent entreaties to all the Makabaki kingdoms, attempting to convince them to join his [[Coalition of monarchs\|alliance]] against the Voidbringers. The Alethi realized that with Emul and Tukar at war, they could only hope to convince one or the other. After [[Tezim\|Tezim's]] rejection of their offer, they chose to focus on convincing Emul. The Emuli were initially hesitant to involve themselves, still locked in their conflict with the Tukari. However, as the singers moved to muster in Marat, they conquered their way across Emul. Between the loss of territory to both the Voidbringers and the Tukari, much of Emul went up in flames and the princedom was reduced to a fraction of its former size. After this devastating blow to the kingdom, as well as the Azish decision to join the coalition, the Emuli were convinced as well. Vexil the Wise and Ashno of Sages traveled to [[Azimir\|Azimir]] and took the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] to Urithiru to treat with the Alethi. They advocated strongly for aid to Emul in retaking their lands from the Tukari, but the other members of the coalition came to the conclusion that this was not a valid use of resources. [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Aladar\|Aladar]] and some of his scribes helped to advise Vexil on fortifying his remaining lands to ensure no further loss of territory.
The following year had the war effort in Emul reach a stand still with multiple skirmishes and attacks by the [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]] against coalition forces. The position of the coalition later changed in 1175, when it was agreed unanimously to push into and defeat the singer forces. This effort was ultimately successful.

## Politics
### Government
Similar to the culturally dominant [[Azish\|Azish]], Emul is lead by a leader known as a Prime. As of 1174, the Prime of Emul was [[Vexil\|Vexil the Wise]]. It is unknown how the title of Prime is passed, it may be inherited or chosen from among the people, such as done with the Azish Prime Aqasix. The Emuli Prime is often referred to as simply Emul.
Despite the fact that Emul is mostly an autonomous kingdom, they still owe some level of deference to the Azish. For instance the Prime of Emul cannot marry the head monarch of another Makabaki kingdom without the permission of the Prime Aqasix. Emul is traditionally rather independent of Azir compared to the other Makabaki kingdoms, making agreements with other nations on their own, but they have become increasingly weakened as their war with the Tukari drags on. They still often follow Azish lead in matters of global import, such as joining Dalinar's coalition. Emul's legal system shows much leniency towards foreigners, although they lack rights such as the ability to own property or a shop in Emul. Emul controls at least a few [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]].

### Military
Emul does have a military, but they are not particularly skilled, and are considered to be less capable than Tukari soldiers, one potential reason the Emuli have been losing their war. At least some portion of the Emuli army is made up of men who are normally farmers instead of career soldiers. The Emuli view warfare in a unique way; they consider it crass to directly strike another warrior, preferring to do damage from a distance. Accordingly, the bow and arrow is the favored weapon of leaders, then spears, halberds, and finally swords, which are the the typical weapons of regular soldiers. Highprince [[Aladar\|Aladar]] has begun advising the princedom on defensive tactics, which may help the army improve. Certain leaders of the Emuli army are involved in the command of the campaign when the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] launches a mission to retake the Emuli homeland.

## Culture
>‚Äú*Their legal system is very lenient toward foreigners. A man who is not of their nationality cannot own a home or shop, but when you visit, you are treated as a 'relative who has traveled from afar, to be shown all kindness and leniency.' A foreigner can take dinner at any residence he calls upon, assuming he is respectful and offers a gift of fruit. The people are most interested in exotic fruits. They worship Jezrien, though they don‚Äôt accept him as a figure from the Vorin religion. They name him the only god.*‚Äù

### Peoples
The Emuli people are technically a tribe of the [[Askarki\|Askarki]] people, but are ethnically [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] with dark brown skin and black hair. Their specific language is unknown, but it is likely a part of the Makabaki language family, and they speak with a smooth accent. They are very accommodating and kindly towards foreigners, treating them as relatives that are visiting from afar. They often host foreign strangers for dinner, in exchange for a gift of fruit, particularly those of exotic variety. They are also very reluctant to give offense to others, even for a Makabaki kingdom.
The Emuli have a specific style of dress as well. Men typically wear robes, while women prefer flowing gowns and head-wraps. The Emuli traditionally greet old friends by holding their left forefinger to their forehead and bowing respectfully. Their cuisine is typically rather salty in flavor.

### Religion
Rejecting the [[Honor\|Almighty]], the Emuli believe [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] to be the only god. According to their mythology, Jezrien named both their kingdom and their capital, Sesemalex Dar. They refer to him as the Prime Kadasix, praying to him for his favor. They seem to hold the other Heralds sacred as well, such as Epan the Lady of Dreams, referring to them as Kadasixes. In fact, wealthy people keep a place in their homes called the Hallowed Hall, where they keep images of the Kadasixes for reverence. The city of Sesemalex Dar is also important in their religion; it is considered to be the Emuli's ancestral homeland, a gift to them from the Heralds. The pattern of the city is also sacred to them and central to their religion, which is one of the reasons they are so desperate to retain control it. The Emuli religion can be described as splinter religion of Vorinism, although which branch is the original is subject to some debate. However, the Vorin peoples to the east believe the Emuli to be pagans, despite the similarities between their faiths.

### Economy
Emul is still largely agrarian with many people working as farmers, reliant on crops such as [[Tallew\|tallew]] and [[Lurnip\|lurnips]] for survival. The war with Tukar has not been good for the Emuli economy, forcing many farmers to take up arms to repel invaders. This has left their fields vulnerable to raids by people looking to sell the crops for an easy profit. Some Emuli also make a living working as mercenaries in other kingdoms. The southwest coast of Roshar is rich in trade, and Emul's capital Sesemalex Dar is a fantastic port and a major trade waypoint in the area. The city is also renown for its fantastic crem pottery.
