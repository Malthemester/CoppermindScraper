**Lake Luthadel** is a body of water northeast of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], along the [[River Channerel\|River Channerel]].
Due to its proximity to the [[Ashmount\|ashmounts]], Lake Luthadel is a sludgy mixture with more ash than water. The canal workers of the area devote their lives to keeping the lake and the river navigable by watercraft. Being both full of ash and located next to a city of hungry [[Skaa\|skaa]], the lake is thought to have little to no fish left in it.

## In the Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], the lake is more solid than the land surrounding it. Its flat surface rises a few inches high and seems to be made of a smoky stone. Plants, with mist rising from their leaves, grow abundantly on the solid stone.
It is on this lake that [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] meets [[Khrissalla\|Khriss]] and [[Nazrilof\|Nazh]].
