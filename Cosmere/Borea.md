>“* It really is as you say. A Shardblade that requires no spren—no enslavement. This is something else. How did you do it?*”
\- Borea to Azure on her Blade[1]


**Borea** is an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] who serves as the first mate of the ship *Honor's Path*.
Borea had some sort of encounter with [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] or had heard of his passage through [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. In 1174, Borea was on the *Honor's Path* when they took [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]] and her companions aboard. [[Vivenna\|Azure]] spoke to Borea and explained to her that her weapon was a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] that required no [[Spren\|spren]] to be made. Azure told Borea that in exchange for the return of her weapon, information on [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], and eventual passage to her destination, she would explain to Borea how her weapon had been crafted. Borea drew Azure's Blade herself and was investigated by her. Borea expressed shock that Azure had a Shardblade that required no enslavement and agreed to the deal.
Like [[Notum\|Notum]], Borea wears a stiff and no nonsense uniform.

## Trivia
Borea's name, like that of a number of other honorspren, is derived from real-world linguistics related to the wind. Specifically, she is named for , the Ancient Greek god of the North Wind.
