**Highprince Bethab** is a highprince of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. His [[Bethab princedom\|princedom]] is in the southwestern corner of Alethkar.
He prefers to use mercenary companies for the bulk of his army. [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] considered him to be a dullard. He seems to let his wife handle most important matters, rather than dealing with them himself.

## History
Bethab coveted the throne and tried at some point to get king [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] to sign a contract that would give him a favored claim in a succession. He is married to [[Mishinah Bethab\|Mishinah]], who he married for her political acumen. When [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] wanted to ally with a highprince for a joint plateau assault during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Bethab turned him down by letting his wife give the refusal. His army subsequently joins [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] on a successful plateau run later on.
When Dalinar gathered the highprinces at [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Bethab once again let his wife handle most matters. When Jasnah became Queen of Alethkar, Bethab fell into line with most of the other highprinces. He and Mishinah went to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to serve as ambassadors there. Bethab proved useful, though not as much as his wife.
