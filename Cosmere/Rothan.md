## Appearance and Personality
While in stormform, Rothan is powerfully built. He seems to crackle with energy, and his red eyes occasionally flash with sparks. He does not typically crave conversation; he simply speaks his mind and expects that others understand him. He cares about [[Venli\|Venli]] because of Leshwi's regard for her.

## Attributes and Abilities
Rothan's use of stormform indicates that he is a [[Regal\|Regal]] and that he is bonded to a [[Stormspren\|stormspren]]. Stormform grants several supernatural powers, including enhanced strength and agility and the ability to shoot red lightning. He is a loyal and well-trained soldier.

## History
Rothan, as head of her soldiers, accompanied [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] and her entourage when she joined [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] in capturing [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Leshwi sent Rothan to be part of the group that made the first contact with humans in the tunnels under Urithiru while infiltrating the tower.
When the [[Pursuer\|Pursuer's]] soldiers began attacking the humans in an effort to get to the infirmary and slaughter the unconscious [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], Rothan's temperament and training held him and the rest of Leshwi's soldiers back from joining the fray, presumably until Leshwi herself began fighting.
