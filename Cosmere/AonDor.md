**AonDor** is a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] located on the [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] [[Sel\|Sel]] that is used by the Elantrians. It involves the use of variously shaped [[Aon\|Aons]], which draw energy from the [[Dor\|Dor]] and must be fine-tuned to the landscape.

## Prerequisites
Only an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] can use the [[Aon\|Aons]] to draw power from the [[Dor\|Dor]]. This means that to use AonDor, a person must originally be of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] descent. The person must then be chosen by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. Their skin will glow, their hair will turn white, and they gain the ability to draw Aons that channel the Dor.

## Drawing Aons
In order to draw a functional Aon, the Elantrian drawing it must intend to do so, or else the glowing lines used to draw the Aon won’t appear. Elantrians can use their fingers to draw Aons, with each finger giving the lines different widths. Other objects like a quill or stick can also be used to draw Aons. Aons can also be crafted out of other materials by Elantrians, like stone or wire. In this way they can make amulets and the like, that have an actual magical effect. Leaving an Aon alone for a short time without completing it will cause it to disappear with no effects.
Each Aon has a unique effect, which is determined by its shape. Aon Aon is the starting point for every other Aon. It appears that the energy can only get to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] in certain pulse lengths and frequencies, so an Aon’s shape only allows for a certain frequency to escape, which has a specific effect. If an Aon is the wrong shape, it may do nothing, and the Aon will flash once and fade away. An Aon drawn incorrectly with an omission of basic lines would begin the process of the Aon, but stop in the middle of the process due to not having enough energy from the Dor. Sometimes if it is targeted at a person or group of people, it could cause them to appear like a Reod Elantrian. The size of an Aon can affect its power. Aons can also be combined together. Aons can be given more control or strength when the width of the lines match the proper locations that correspond with [[Arelon\|Arelon]].
Aons can only be destroyed by an Elantrian. Unless destroyed by an Elantrian an Aon will continue to function even if it is scuffed or erased. It is possible for AonDor to negate effects granted by [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]].

## Aon Modifiers
While Aons are undoubtedly powerful, in order to specify certain traits, like how long a column of fire from an Aon Ehe will last, or where an Aon Tia will take you, additional lines must be drawn around the central Aon to modify its effects.

### Types of Modifiers
Linking Aons - used to link subsections of Aon lists together, it controls the timing of when other Aons take effect.
Setting off different chains of Aons.
Modifying power levels of Aon effects.
Modifying the range of Aons.
## Aon Equations
In extremely advanced uses of AonDor, multiple Aons can be used in conjunction to modify each other in Aon equations. These are used to channel the Dor in the most specific ways allowed by AonDor. With it, Elantrians could fabricate any object out of nothing, although the sheer skill and practice required makes Elantrians who can do this extremely rare. In addition to its regular effect, it appears that each Aon has a secondary effect that can be used in the Aon equations.

## Relationship To Arelon
AonDor has a specific tie to the land of Arelon. The base Aon Aon is shaped like the land of Arelon, with its lines and dot representing the coast, Atad Mountains, and Lake Alonoe. Every Aon reflects some trait of the land, such as the Dii, the Aon for wood, contain circles where the forests of Arelon fall. This is a very fluid relationship; as the land changes so do the Aons. When an earthquake created a chasm in the south of Arelon, a new line was required in every Aon to make it functional. AonDor's power will diminish the further an Elantrian travels from the city of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]].
It is possible to create another city similar to Elantris in other locations on Sel. The [[Ire\|Ire]] created a base similar to it in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], though in order for this to work, Investiture from Sel needs to be piped to it. There are, however, other ways to achieve the same effect.
AonDor will not normally work on [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]] other than [[Sel\|Sel]], but it is possible to hack the magic system and get it to work on other Shardworlds. One way is for a Full [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]] to use an [[Aluminum\|unsealed]] [[Nicrosil\|nicrosilmind]] to create a medallion that allows an Elantrian to store their [[Connection\|Connection]] to Sel.

## History
### The First Elantrians
King [[Raoshem\|Rhashm]] led his people from other lands to Arelon, discovering the city of Elantris completely abandoned. Despite superstition about Elantris being haunted, Rhashm made it his capital. After a few decades, Princess [[Elashe\|Elashe]], one of his descendants, was the first Aonic person to be taken by the Shaod to become an Elantrian.

### The Reod
For centuries, AonDor functioned fine, Elantrians ruling Arelon from Elantris. However, when the earthquake caused the Chasm, the Elantrians became the target of the now malformed Rao that made up Elantris and the Outer Cities. This caused them to become cursed and foul looking, as well as robbing them of their access to the magic system. They didn’t know where the new line was, so they couldn’t use the magic. Most were slaughtered mercilessly by the terrified citizenry.

### Restoration of Elantris
[[Raoden\|Raoden]] managed to discover what was wrong with the AonDor during his imprisonment in the city, and he repaired the Rao and restored the city to its former glory. He, an Elantrian, took his place as king of Arelon, ruling from the city of Elantris.
