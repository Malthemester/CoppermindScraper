## Appearance and Personality
Urv is young, tall, and gangly. [[Ellista\|Ellista]] describes him as obnoxiously loud, but he has shown the ability to remain quiet when he chooses. He enjoys [[Alethi\|Alethi]] epics and has read both *An Accountability of Virtue* and its sequel, surprising Ellista. He appears to have a mischievous streak, intentionally provoking Ellista regarding the book.

## Attributes and Abilities
Urv follows the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] faith. He is a well-read, knowledgeable, and competent scholar, although he is not quite as ingenious as Ellista.

## History
 by  Dragontrill 
After [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] released information about the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]], Urv was one of several ardents at Jokasha Monastery who worked on translating [[Bendthel\|Bendthel's]] collection of Dawnchant works, although he made less progress than Ellista. He had also gotten stuck working on the [[Covad Fragment\|Covad Fragment]], but reviewing Ellista's work helped him realize that not all literature that appeared to be written in Dawnchant had actually originated in that language. Because Dawnchant was the codified written language across Roshar for many centuries, there was a period of time where people continued to use Dawnchant characters to phonetically transcribe other spoken languages, rather than switch to a different writing system.
He offered to lend Ellista the sequel to *An Accountability of Virtue* in exchange for her help translating a section of Dawnchant for a very demanding unnamed patron. The assignment was likely the translation of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] in order to aid with [[Taravangian\|Taravangian's]] plotting.
