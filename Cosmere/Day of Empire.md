>“*Go to the heathen peoples of the West and declare to them my final warning, for while my Empire is eternal, my patience will soon end. Not much longer will I slumber within a tomb of rock. The Day of Empire is at hand, and my glory will soon shine forth, a second sun blazing forth from Fjorden.*”
\-Wyrn Wulfden the Fourth, attributed to Jaddeth[1]

The **Day of Empire** was a day prophesied by [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]] when the whole world would be converted to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]], the Derethi god, would return to [[Sel\|Sel]].
In an attempt to bring about this day, Wyrn planned to send [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] to warn [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and [[Teod\|Teod]] of his impending attack, followed by a genocidal slaughter of all people of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] descent. This culminated in Wyrn sending [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]] monks to Arelon and Teod for the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]] and the [[Battle of Teoras\|Battle of Teoras]]. Both these attacks failed and Arelon and Teod remained independent, so the Day of Empire has not occurred yet.

## Elantris sequel
In the sequel to Elantris, Wyrn decides to reinterpret scripture to suggest that only the nations to the east of the [[Atad Mountains\|Atad Mountains]] needed to be Derethi for Jaddeth to return, so it is possible that the Day of Empire will occur during the [[Elantris sequel\|Elantris sequel]].
