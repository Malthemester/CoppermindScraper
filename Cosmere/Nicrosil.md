**Nicrosil** is the external enhancement pushing metal. An Allomancer burning nicrosil is able to enhance the effects of another Allomancer's powers. Feruchemists can use nicrosil to store Investiture, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, nicrosil steals Investiture. While the exact composition of Allomantic or Feruchemical nicrosil is unknown, real-world nicrosil is an alloy primarily of nickel, with some [[Chromium\|chromium]] and a small amount of silicon.

## Allomantic Use
A nicrosil [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Nicroburst**. A Nicroburst burning nicrosil and touching another Allomancer will cause the latter's reserves of the metals that are currently burning to disappear and give a huge burst of power to the recipient. This can cause issues with metals such as [[Tin\|tin]], where the mental overload can cause unconsciousness.

### Boosting Investiture
A Nicroburst can also boost other forms of Investiture, such as [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], but only when the Feruchemist is tapping their metalmind.

## Feruchemical Use
A nicrosil [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Soulbearer**. Nicrosil is used to store [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. This ability is not understood (even by those who utilize it). A Soulbearer storing Investiture stores their ability to use their Investiture. Therefore, a Soulbearer could store their ability to use Feruchemy and another person tapping it would be turned into a temporary Feruchemist who has the ability to fill a metalmind (assuming the nicrosilmind was unkeyed). Among other things, a nicrosilmind can be used to store the [[Divine Breath\|divine Breath]] of the [[Returned\|Returned]] and the ability to use various [[Surge\|surges]] of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Filling a nicrosilmind as fast as possible hides a person from an [[Awakener\|Awakener's]] life sense.

### Compounding
A nicrosil [[Compounding\|Compounder]] would be able to use nicrosil to have a nearly infinite supply of stored Investiture.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, nicrosil steals [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. This does not steal powers—the ability to use Invested Arts like Allomancy or [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]]—but rather general Investiture, such as a piece of a person's soul or [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breaths]].

## Trivia
In the [[Mistborn Adventure Game\|Mistborn Adventure Game]] nicrosil can be used to convert between forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. This allows for a [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]] to convert between what is stored in their [[Metalmind\|metalminds]] (i.e. converting the mental speed in a zincmind into the strength in a pewtermind).
