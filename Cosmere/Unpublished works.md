This page lists all of [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson's]] works, written or unwritten, that have not been published. Some of these are written novels that have been "trunked", some of which have been re-written or cannibalized from. Some are ideas Brandon has talked about briefly but it is unknown if they will ever actually be written. The remainder are forthcoming works that, while unwritten, will come out eventually.
A list of those works that have been published can be found in the [[Bibliography\|Bibliography]] article.

## Forthcoming Works
### Cosmere works





### Non-cosmere works



## Potential Works
These are projects that Brandon has mentioned as possibilities but there are no firm plans in place.

### Cosmere Works


### Non-Cosmere Works

## "Trunked" Novels
These are works that are unlikely to ever be published either because elements have been co-opted for use in other books (as with *Mythwalker* and *Aether of Night*) or because the book has been re-written from scratch (as with *White Sand* Prime and *The Way of Kings* Prime).
