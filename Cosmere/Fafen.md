\-Fafen and Vivenna discussing Siri's departure from Idris.[2]


**Fafen** was a princess of [[Idris\|Idris]], the third child of King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]], with elder siblings being [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]], [[Ridger\|Ridger]], and her younger sister being [[Siri\|Siri]]. Of the three sisters, Fafen was the middle sister in almost every way. She was midway in height between Vivenna and Siri, and less proper than Vivenna, though not as careless as Siri.
Fafen was a monk of [[Austrism\|Austrism]], and so she wore white robes and was required have her hair completely sheared off. Her duty, as with all monks, is to grow food for the needy, do tasks around the city, and provide for those who could not provide for themselves. Fafen made the choice to become a monk before her tenth birthday, and has devoted herself to this task ever since. It was tradition that noble or rich families were obligated to send a child to the monasteries. Siri was happy that Fafen was the monk in the family and not her, and said she would have gone crazy living as a monk. Fafen also had a curvy figure, which attracted men around [[Bevalis\|Bevalis]], but her status as a monk kept suitors at bay, as they would have to become monks if they wished to marry her.
Fafen had taken lessons in court life and politics in case Vivenna died before marrying the God King of Hallandren. When Siri was sent to Hallandren instead of Vivenna, Fafen believed that Vivenna would inherit the throne of Idris instead of Ridger.
Fafen had a tendency to avoid thinking things through unless she was confronted with them directly, which meant that people often had to engage her with blunt comments to get through to her.
