## Appearance and Personality
Jochi is known to the world as a female philosopher, but in reality he is a potbellied baker in his sixties who runs a pastry shop in Thaylen City. Neither his true name nor the motivation for his anonymity have been revealed. He has a jocular personality, but can also be solemn.

## Attributes and Abilities
Jochi is a [[Veristitalian\|Veristitalian]] and a friend of [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] and [[Ethid\|Ethid]]. Jasnah notes that Jochi is extremely intelligent; he is one of the few people that is her equal as a historical scholar.

## History
It is not clear how long Jochi has known Ethid and Jasnah, but the three of them studied under the same master and seem to have a close relationship. They stay in regular contact using [[Spanreed\|spanreeds]], using passcodes to identify themselves.
After arriving in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Jasnah contacted both Jochi and Ethid through intermediaries at a spanreed hub in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]]. It was the first time that they had heard from her after her disappearance during the sinking of the *Wind's Pleasure*, as she lost her spanreeds at the time. Jochi was happy to hear from Jasnah and expressed a desire to visit Urithiru, although he did not want to risk revealing his true identity. The three colleagues discussed current events; Jochi was skeptical of Ethid's claim that [[Nale\|Nale]] was still alive and active on Roshar. Jochi mentioned a sighting of [[Axies the Collector\|Axies the Collector]] and reported on the state of Thaylenah, including the fact that [[Singer\|singers]] had stolen most of their fleet. He also gave Jasnah a description of the unnamed [[Spren\|spren]] of the [[Order of Truthwatchers\|Order of Truthwatchers]]. This later became relevant at the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] when Jasnah saw [[Glys\|Glys]] and knew that something was wrong with his appearance.
Upon meeting some of the [[Herald\|Heralds]] in person, Jasnah noted that her many historical debates with Jochi had been rendered irrelevant since the Heralds had actually lived through the entire known history of Roshar.
