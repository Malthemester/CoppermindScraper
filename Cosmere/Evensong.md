**Evensong** was an orbital [[Platform\|platform]] hanging between  and . It was the most remote of all the Outer Platforms, the farthest human outpost in deep-space. It is months away from Earth by ship.
Evensong was a flat piece of metal, fifty miles long, with buildings on both the top and bottom. The area on the top is called **Topside**. It was surrounded by a bubble of air, and ESG generators (Element-specific gravity generators) give it gravity, while fusion generators also help to make it habitable. Many of Evensong's skyrises and towers were linked by walkways. It was the frontier of humanity's conquest in space. But despite how futuristic and advanced it is, it still had slums. The slums have drying clothes and ragged drapes hung from the buildings and pedestrians walking more than in other areas. [[Orson Ansed\|Orson Ansed]] feels the area has a sense of despair to it.
The buildings on Evensong were built of rich [[Telanium\|telanium]], a super-light, silvery metal that does not corrode or fall apart. Most of the buildings had been prefabricated with the platform. The buildings were spacious, well constructed, and sleek. Most buildings were poorly-lit, and its distance from the sun kept it in a perpetual state of twilight.
Evensong has a police force. Orson Ansed is a captain on it and [[Ken Harris\|Ken Harris]] is a relatively new officer. Evensong also has a research facility for the [[Phone Company\|Phone Company]]. [[Denise Carlson\|Denise Carlson]] was a researcher there before she disappeared.
