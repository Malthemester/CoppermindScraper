## History
 by Matthew Johnson
Nicelle Sauvage claims she trained with [[Baz-Kor\|Baz-Kor]] monks, who taught her how to fight and get close enough to use her [[Chromium\|chromium]] on targets. She also supposedly studied ballet, which enhanced her balance. It is unknown whether any of these claims are true.
She reported briefly glimpsing a figure in a mountain range in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], describing it as having "piercing eyes, and a face like some otherwordly beast."
She later reports how she retrieved half of a map of [[New Seran\|New Seran]] from [[Nazh\|Nazh]] that contained a letter from her father. In the same excerpt, she also sees a white-haired storyteller who may be [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
Her adventures are published in the *The House Record* and *The New Ascendancy*. She learns the art of storytelling from [[Jak\|Jak]]. Like Jak, she embellishes her stories.

## Trivia
Nicelle Sauvage may be the main character in a future novella by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] tentatively titled '[[Boatload of Mummies\|Boatload of Mummies]].'
