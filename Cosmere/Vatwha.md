**Vatwha** is a [[Singer\|singer]] and one of the [[Fused\|Fused]], a member of the shanay-im. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], she wears long clothing.
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] danced with Vatwha thousands of years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], but later, she was trained--presumably by [[Odium\|Odium]]--to watch for Hoid.
Hoid saw Vatwha in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] after the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], hovering in the air, acting as a sentry. Despite her training to spot Hoid, she gave him barely a glance when he passed underneath her in disguise. Hoid decided to not take it as an insult.
