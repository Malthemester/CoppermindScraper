A **grandbow** is an incredibly powerful bow created by attaching an augmenter fabrial to a large bow. Invented by the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], they are sometimes called **Shardbows** because users typically must be enhanced by the strength of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] in order to fully draw them.

## Appearance and Functionality
Grandbows are constructed from steel and are about as tall as a man. A small gemstone attached to the bow by an [[Artifabrian\|artifabrian]] provides [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and ensures that the metal does not warp under the stress of being drawn. The arrows used with a grandbow are as thick as three fingers, and are quite long.

## History
Grandbows were designed by [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Artifabrian\|artifabrians]] led by [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. They were often used during [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]] hunts to injure the creatures before the hunters moved in for the final kill. In 1173, [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] used a grandbow to attack the chasmfiend that surprised the Alethi during a hunt, while Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] as well as [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] attacked it with their [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]]. Some of the Alethi that had Plate but no Blade (including [[Rust Elthal\|Rust Elthal]] and [[Serugiadis\|Serugiadis]]) sometimes practiced with grandbows as an alternative to a [[Shardhammer\|shardhammer]] or another melee weapon.
[[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]] used a grandbow during his fight with [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] at the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. Amaram lost the bow when Kaladin scared off his horse, and it was retrieved by [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]]. Lunamor was able to draw the bow and kill Amaram, who had been joined with [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]], with arrows through the head and chest. He is the only person to have drawn a grandbow without the aid of Shardplate, and it is not known how he did so. His daughter [[Cord\|Cord]] referred to [[Spren\|spren]] strengthening Lunamor's arm when he drew the [[Bow of Hours\|Bow of Hours]] in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], but Lunamor declined to speak about the subject.
Amaram's grandbow was passed onto Cord, who was also a skilled archer. [[Cord\|Cord]] used the grandbow to kill [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] before the assault on [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. During a [[Skybreaker\|Skybreaker]] attack at the Battle of [[Emul\|Emul]], Cord used the bow to shoot an arrow directly into [[Nale\|Nale's]] face, but he easily healed from the injury. Nale was also able to catch an arrow that Cord had fired from mere feet away.

## Living Shardbows
It is possible that a bonded [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] [[Spren\|spren]] may be manifested as a living Shardbow instead of a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], although this seems to be uncommon and has not been seen since at least the [[Recreance\|Recreance]].
