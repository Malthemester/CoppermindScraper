## History
### Life
The Strangler was an ordinary man. He had a good family and friends as well as a job that paid him a satisfactory wage. However, inexplicably, the Copper Strangler began killing women. He would strangle them with copper wire and then sink their bodies in the canals to hide them. He probably committed at least a few of these crimes in the Eighth Octant of Elendel. Eventually, Lord [[Peterus\|Peterus]], who was a simple constable at the time, joined in the investigation and captured the Copper Strangler himself.

### Legacy
The capture of the Copper Strangler led to acclaim, awards, and promotions for Lord Peterus, probably resulting in his position as chief constable of the Eighth Octant. Peterus was also invited to become a lord and a member of Elendel's high society.
Years later, the Copper Strangler was still a case that fascinated criminologists, such as Lady [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]]. The question of why such a normal man could do such terrible things for no apparent reason still puzzled them.
