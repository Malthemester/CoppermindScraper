This article refers to the cave system inhabited by the [[Kandra\|kandra]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].¬†For the region of the same name in [[Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell\|Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell]], see [[Homeland\|Homeland]].
The **Homeland** was the secret, underground nation of the [[Kandra\|kandra]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the Final Empire.
It was located in the same mountain range as the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]] and the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]], in fact many of its tunnels connected to the latter and had to be kept blocked and guarded. It was located close to Luthadel. After [[Harmony\|Harmony]] remade the world an entrance to the Homeland was placed directly under the [[Field of Rebirth\|Field of Rebirth]]. The caverns of the Homeland were said to be quite large, too large to be filled by the kandra, some members liked the solitude they provided after decades out on [[Contract\|Contracts]].

## The Trustwarren

The Trustwarren was one of the most important caverns in the entire cave complex, evidenced by the fact that it was one of the only rooms lit by oil lamps. It was circular and had metal walls. In the center there was a platform about a foot tall made of steel, with a small hole in the center. It served a number of functions such as a meeting room for the entire kandra people, a courtroom, and as the location of the Trust.
The Trust was the name given by the kandra to the Lord Ruler's [[Atium\|atium]] cache, which was part of [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] power. The vast majority of the atium mined in the Pits never left the complex but was instead smuggled into the Homeland, to be hidden under the platform in the center of the Trustwarren. This was done to deny Ruin access to a part of his power. The atium used to pay for service Contracts was also added to the Trust.
