The **Impossible Falls** was a waterfall located in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Location and Structure
The Impossible Falls are located in the southwest corner of the city of Kholinar, seemingly adjoining one of the [[Windblades\|windblades]]. Water flows down the Impossible Falls from tier to tier. Whether the Falls are a natural formation or manmade is uncertain, but it is said that when they are viewed from the correct angles the water seems to flow down the tiers and then back to the top.

## History

Three days later, [[Szeth\|Szeth]] assassinated Gavilar.
