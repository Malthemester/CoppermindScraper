>“* I offer you a boon. Name what you wish of me or of this court. It shall be yours.*”
\- King Elhokar to Adolin[1]


On [[Roshar\|Roshar]], the **King's Boon** is a privilege that can be granted to a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] who has performed an impressive feat before the King of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], such as winning a difficult duel. The limit of what the boon can grant is unknown, though it presumably must adhere to existing laws and traditions, meaning that a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] cannot demand it or use it to challenge a lighteyes. If a boon is granted that affects another subject of the king, that person must obey it as well.

## History
The origins of the King's Boon are uncertain. Much like the [[Right of Challenge\|Right of Challenge]], the King's Boon was a tradition that fell by the wayside in the centuries leading up to the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], although it remained well-known to the Alethi lighteyes. It was revived by King [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] when he sought to rid himself of a rebellious [[Highprince\|highprince]], [[Yenev\|Yenev]]. To assist Gavilar, [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] dueled an unknown man with the purpose of awing the crowd. Upon his victory, Gavilar offered Sadeas a boon; he invoked the Right of Challenge, demanding that Yenev duel him to the death. Sadeas then killed Yenev, paving the way for [[Aladar\|Aladar]] to replace him.
In the weeks preceding the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]] sought to entrap Sadeas in a similar way. Following his victory in a four-on-one duel, [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] was granted a boon by king [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], and used it to to demand the Right of Challenge from Sadeas. However, at the same time [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] also demanded a boon for participating in the duel and coming to Adolin's rescue. When it turned out that Kaladin wanted to challenge [[Amaram\|Amaram]], he was arrested for slander since he was a darkeyes, and Sadeas managed to weasel out of his own duel in the ensuing chaos.
