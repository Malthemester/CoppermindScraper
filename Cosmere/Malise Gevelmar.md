## Appearance and Personality
Malise is short and plump. She has "buttonlike features" and black hair with blonde streaks.
She is the youngest daughter of Brightlord [[Gevelmar\|Gevelmar]]. House Gevelmar is rural and not particularly notable. As a member of the nobility, she has some disdain for those of lower [[Dahn\|dahn]]. She is generally non-threatening, but is capable of significant anger.

## History
Shortly after [[Shallan's mother\|Shallan's mother]] died, her father married Malise and she moved into the Davar estate in [[Valam princedom\|Valam princedom]]. Around that time, the Davar family was going broke, the oldest son [[Helaran\|Helaran]] had deserted the family, and Lin was increasingly unstable, often throwing things at his servants or beating them severely. Over the next few years, Lin's sanity seemed to gradually decline despite the discovery of valuable quarries on Davar lands.
Malise initially accepted Lin's story that [[Shallan's mother\|Shallan's mother]] was killed by her lover in a murder-suicide, but later questioned whether this was true after Lin began battering her. When Lin later ordered [[Rin\|Rin]] to assassinate Lin's own son Helaran, Malise vehemently protested. Lin became enraged and beat her, breaking her arm and imprisoning her in her room. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] tried to arrange for [[Balat\|Balat]] and Malise to escape the house, but shortly before the planned escape, Malise revealed the plan and Lin killed her with blows to the head. Balat confronted Lin, but Lin severely injured him and attempted to attack [[Eylita\|Eylita]]. However, Malise's death prompted Shallan to give Lin wine poisoned with [[Blackbane\|blackbane]], which incapacitated him. Shallan was forced to kill Lin and the family discovered the broken [[Davar soulcaster\|Davar soulcaster]], setting events into motion that resulted in Shallan seeking an apprenticeship with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]].

## Relationships
### Lin Davar
Malise is sent to marry Lin by her father in an arranged marriage, and they are married less than a month after meeting each other. Approximately six months after her marriage to Lin, [[Wikim\|Wikim]] notes that Malise cries every other night. Lin beats Malise, scaring off one of Shallan's tutors named [[Hasheh\|Hasheh]]. Lin's behavior causes multiple tutors to quit, and Malise is stuck looking for replacements. As things devolve in the Davar household, Malise regrets the marriage. She tells Shallan that there is a "beast" inside Lin and that he cannot let things go. She believes he will ultimately kill the entire family.

### Shallan Davar
Malise oversees Shallan's studies despite her own lack of education. Since the Davars cannot retain tutors, Malise wants to teach Shallan, but she is not equipped to do so; her family ignored education like many rural [[Veden\|Veden]] houses. She is able to read [[Women's script\|women's script]] but has little knowledge about history or other subjects. Like Shallan's brothers, Malise harbors some resentment that Shallan is the only one in the family who avoids Lin's wrath. Shallan feels like she barely knows her stepmother despite years of living together, but does feel protective of her.
