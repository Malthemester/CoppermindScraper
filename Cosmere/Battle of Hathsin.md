The **Battle of Hathsin** was a seminal moment in the history of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], occurring near the cavern system containing the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] and [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It was the culmination of the slow war of attrition between the intents of the [[Shard\|Shards]] [[Preservation\|Preservation]] and [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. It resulted in the near-destruction of Scadrial, the consumption of most of the world's [[Atium\|atium]], and the subsequent remaking of the planet by [[Sazed\|Sazed]] during the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. It also resulted in the deaths of [[Elend\|Elend]], [[Vin\|Vin]], [[Ati\|Ati]], and many other people.

## History
In the early stages of life on Scadrial, [[Leras\|Leras]], the [[Vessel\|Vessel]] of Preservation, struck a deal with [[Ati\|Ati]], the Vessel of Ruin: that while Preservation could create humanity, a species with sentience and more Preservation than Ruin within itself, Ruin would eventually be able to destroy the world. The creation of humanity expended a portion of Preservation's power, giving Ruin a slight advantage and breaking the balance of the two powers. This imbalance, however small, would allow Ruin to gradually make good on their deal. However, Preservation could not allow his creations to be destroyed and broke the deal, imprisoning Ruin's mind and drastically limiting his ability to influence the world at the cost of Preservation's own.

## Lead-up
After the [[Siege of Fadrex City\|Siege of Fadrex City]], and [[Vin\|Vin's]] realization of Ruin's desire for [[Atium\|atium]] - a portion of his power hidden from him by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], she took off towards [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] in a feign to draw his attention, claiming that they had already found the cache. Ruin sent all of his [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitors]] after Vin, to stop her and capture the cache, but soon realized her trick as she fought the Inquisitors over [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]]. However, [[Marsh\|Marsh]], desperately holding on to a portion of his sanity under Ruin's influence, is aided by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], who has partial control of Preservation's power, is finally able to momentarily buck the control of Ruin, pushing out Vin's earring and allowing her to finally consume the [[Mist\|mists]] and draw in all of Preservation's power, defeating the Inquisitors and Ascending.
Shortly following Vin's Ascension, the coup, led by [[KanPaar\|KanPaar]], inadvertently reveals the true location of the Lord Ruler's atium cache: the [[Trustwarren\|Trustwarren]]. Located adjacent to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]], the Lord Ruler had cleverly hidden away the majority of the Atium mined there in a metal enclosed room within the [[Kandra homeland\|kandra homeland]]. Ruin immediately tried to claim the [[Kandra\|kandra]] though their [[Hemalurgy\|hemalurgic]] [[Blessing\|Blessings]], but the vast majority of the kandra population carried out the [[Resolution\|Resolution]] of their [[First Contract\|First Contract]], removing their blessings and Ruin's hold over their population, sacrificing their sentience and reverting to [[Mistwraith\|mistwraiths]]. However, a few rebellious kandra remained, and Sazed is able to pen them within the Trustwarren just long enough for Elend to arrive, guided by Vin and the trail of the [[Mistfallen\|Mistfallen]] soldiers he had sent to Luthadel.

## The Battle
 by  Hunter Bonyun  Vin fuels Elend's Allomancy
Not to be deterred, Ruin senot his army of several hundred thousand [[Koloss\|koloss]] to assault the Pits, only for Elend to realize that his Mistfallen battalion were all Seers, [[Misting\|mistings]] capable of burning atium. With a constant supply of atium dredged out by Sazed and other survivors, they fought spectacularly against seemingly endless waves of koloss. But in the end, their metal reserves begin to dwindle, and they started to fall, one-by-one. Marsh arrived from Luthadel, dueling with an exhausted and drained Elend, who eventually fought only via an infusion of Vin's power. Ruin, through Marsh, taunted Elend, gloating over his impending victory, but Elend revealed their true purpose has been fulfilled: Burning away all of the atium that was stored within the Trustwarren. Marsh beheaded Elend in a final outburst of anger and hacked apart his body. [[Demoux\|Demoux]], one of the few surviving Mistfallen, retreated to the entrance of the caves, watching with Sazed.
However, Elend's death left Vin no reason to continue living, and gave her the motivation to assault Ruin with the full force of Preservation. Her new status as a Vessel allowed her to ignore the Shard's Intent to preserve, and she gave up her life to assure their mutual destruction. Both her and Ati died from the clashing of their power. As the powers faltered, the koloss were left without direction and turned on one another, effectively ending the battle.

## Aftermath
After the conflict, Vin and Ati's bodies fell to the ground near Elend, and Sazed ran forward to find their lifeless bodies. In his grief, he came to a sudden realization, taking the power of the Shards leaking from their bodies, ascending to become [[Harmony\|Harmony]], and fulfilling the prophecies of the [[Hero of Ages\|Hero of Ages]], initiating the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], who had been observing the battle from the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], encountered the souls of Elend, Vin, and Ati after their deaths.
