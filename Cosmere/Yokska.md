## History
Yokska and her husband ran a tailor shop in Kholinar that catered to wealthy male customers; the shop had a showroom, a workroom, and separate living quarters. She had presumably lived in Kholinar for some time, as [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] was a dedicated customer. Yokska employed at least one maid in the shop.

>“*But oh! When that new storm came, the one with the red lightning, it left a gloom over the palace. So nasty! Dark times. I suppose … suppose those haven't ended.*”
\-Yokska[1]

During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], Adolin brought [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] rescue party to Yokska's shop; he trusted Yokska and thought it would be an inconspicuous place to hide. [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], and Adolin interviewed Yokska regarding the recent events in the city. Although she was a bit scattered, she was able to provide a significant amount of information regarding [[Aesudan\|Aesudan's]] strange behavior, the execution of [[Pai\|Pai]], the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], the [[Screamers\|screamers]], and the disappearance of the [[Palace Guard\|Palace Guard]]. She provided some hope when she mentioned that some [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] and the [[Kholinar Wall Guard\|Wall Guard]] had resisted Aesudan's orders. The three men kept asking questions until [[Shallan\|Shallan]] noticed that Yokska needed a break. While the interview was happening, [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]] searched Yokska's bedroom and did not find anything incriminating.
The shop was in an area of the city that had remained relatively unscathed by the events of the siege. It remained the rescue party's base of operations, and they held several meetings there. Yokska continued to provide information about the city—including Brightlord [[Velalant\|Velalant]], the food shortage, and the [[Cult of Moments\|Cult of Moments]]—while Elhokar and his party formulated their plan to open the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] adjacent to the palace. She also made Adolin a flamboyant suit to use as part of his disguise while in public.
Just before the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] assault on the palace, Adolin thanked Yokska for her help and instructed her to flee towards the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] if the city fell. Yokska was already unsettled by the recent turns of events in the city, and was shocked that she and her husband would have to travel so far.
After the [[Singer\|singers]] took over Kholinar Yokska was not able to continue working as a tailor, but she was able to maintain her reputation. When Lady [[Leshwi\|Leshwi]] needed an expert tailor to design new robes for her, she asked her [[Voice\|Voice]], [[Venli\|Venli]], to find an expert tailor to do it for her. Venli found Yokska and brought her before Leshwi, but the [[Fused\|Fused]] refused to have a human work for her and insisted on using a singer. Leshwi told Venli to have Yokska teach an [[Artform\|artform]] singer who could then do the job Leshwi needed done.
