## Acquisition and Properties
A singer can sing the [[Song of Prayer\|Song of Prayer]] to create a Voidlight sphere, though this would draw Odium's attention. It appears that this process is perhaps somewhat troublesome or time-consuming, as during battle, the [[Pursuer\|Pursuer]] would go to someplace to fetch stored Voidlight instead of creating it directly. In the past, [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] is said to have provided it. The [[Fused\|Fused]] enter the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] suffused with Voidlight. Leaving gemstones out in [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] doesn't infuse them with Voidlight.
Voidlight is stored in gemstones similar to Stormlight, but these two types of light cannot be stored in the same gemstone. Voidlight leaks significantly slower than Stormlight.
Voidlight takes the form of dark, purple-on-black vapor, glowing violet. When a person is infused with it, Voidlight spreads over the surface of their skin rather than sinking in. On the skin, it pulses, and when a person infused with Voidlight moves, they leave behind trails of violet light. However, Voidlight does not leak from the Fused.
Voidlight has an emotional effect similar to Stormlight, but instead of a need to move, it causes a feeling of enhanced passion, and emotions become more vibrant. When drawn into the body of a singer, it infuses mainly the gemheart, rather than the entire body as with Stormlight. Humans can draw in Voidlight if they learn the correct tone and rhythm.

## Uses

Historically, the [[Regal\|Regal]] forms of the [[Singer\|singers]] are associated with Voidlight, which is said to come from the king of gods. Voidlight powers some, if not all, of Regals' special powers. In the present day, it's used by the [[Fused\|Fused]] to access [[Surge\|Surges]], similarly to how a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] uses [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. Also similarly, Voidlight provides healing to the person infused with it. However, Fused do not lose Voidlight when not using it, and it can power their Surges for far longer, albeit more weakly. Holding it has some sort of emotional impact, though different from Stormlight's.
Several [[Unmade\|Unmade]] are associated with Voidlight. Bonding with [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]] causes a person to grow violet crystals, including a [[Gemheart\|gemheart]] pulsing with Voidlight. The sphere containing [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul]] glows dark purple. Moreover, when Dalinar sees [[Odium\|Odium's]] true nature, the fire it burns with has the same coloring.
[[Larkin\|Larkin]] are capable of feeding on Voidlight, with no apparent ill effects.

## Trivia
The appearance of Voidlight is inspired by , a type of chimerical colors. A chimerical color can be "perceived" when a person stares at one color until the cones in their eyes tire, then looks at another, with an afterimage causing the colors to mix into imaginary shades in the observer's brain. Stygian colors are a subset of those occurring when the second color is black.
