## Location
It is a part of the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]] in Hallandren's capital, [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]]. It located at the base of the court plateau and is connected to the rest of the complex by a long, covered walkway. A number of guards are posted inside and outside of the building to maintain security.

## Structure
The enclave is massive, with four huge warehouse-like spaces that each house around 10,000 Lifeless. There are viewing platforms built above the warehouse spaces for [[Returned\|Returned]] and priests to observe the soldiers. These spaces have no lighting, and lanterns must be used by visitors. The building includes exercise space and medical facilities for maintenance of the Lifeless. The compound includes twisting passageways intended to confuse potential invaders.

## Function
The Lifeless Enclave serves as a barracks for the 40,000 [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] that comprise the bulk of the [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] military forces. Because Lifeless do not require basic human needs like food or sleep, they can be efficiently maintained by a relatively small group of servants. The Returned who control the Lifeless give them instructions to obey the servants if they are requested to exercise or go to the infirmary. The servants can then ensure that the Lifeless stay in good condition and maintain their muscle tone; they also test and refresh the [[Ichor-alcohol\|ichor-alcohol]] of each Lifeless as needed.

## History
The Lifeless Enclave was presumably built after the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] and the establishment of Hallandren. It had been impossible to create and sustain large Lifeless armies prior to several discoveries made by the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]] during that conflict. The Lifeless army in the garrison grew over time until it numbered around 40,000; they were typically commanded by four different Returned, each holding the [[Command\|Command]] phrase to control 10,000 soldiers. Any Returned could visit the enclave at any time if they wanted to observe the operations there. However, doing so could be unsettling, as the fully armed Lifeless stand in completely silent ranks, and their eyes stay open despite being kept in the dark.

### Pahn Kahl Rebellion
During the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]], a tunnel system underneath the Court of Gods was extended to provide clandestine entrances to each of the four main chambers of the Lifeless Enclave. The newer tunnels and entrances had been built at the command of [[Bluefingers\|Bluefingers]], and [[Vasher\|Vasher]] was also aware of them. [[Awakener\|Awakeners]] loyal to Bluefingers used the tunnel entrances to break the Commands of some of the Lifeless in the enclave and insert hidden Commands of their own. [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] discovered the secret entrances after having unusual visions about the tunnels, although he did not immediately recognize their significance.
The enclave fell into the hands of the rebels, supported by the stolen Lifeless and [[Denth\|Denth's]] mercenaries. The rebels were able to take control of the entire Lifeless army by torturing and extorting [[Blushweaver\|Blushweaver]] and Lightsong for their Command phrases. Bluefingers planned to use the now-empty enclave as a setting to frame the two Returned for the rebel attack on the [[God King\|God King]]. The rebels sent the Lifeless army to attack [[Idris\|Idris]], but they were intercepted and destroyed by [[Kalad's Phantoms\|Kalad's Phantoms]]. The enclave presumably lost its usefulness, and its fate is unknown.
