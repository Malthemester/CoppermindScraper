>“* ...by tradition, he was more than just her master. He was her father, legally, until he pronounced her ready to become a merchant on her own.*”
\- Rysn discussing her babsk[1]


**Babsk** (plural *babsk*) is a term for a teacher or master in [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. Legally, a babsk is father to their apprentices as long as the apprenticeship lasts. Their apprentices follow them around, assisting them with their trade, and learning from them. [[Vstim\|Vstim]], [[Rysn\|Rysn's]] babsk, is kind to her and wants to teach her how to be a good merchant, but not all babsk are, and this may not be common behavior. Rysn's full name appears to be Rysn Ftori bah-Vstim; it is unclear whether this is a personal sign of respect or if all Thaylen apprentice merchants append their babsk's name.

## Known Babsk
Vstim is Rysn's babsk and takes her to places all around the world, such as [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] and the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]], in order for her to learn to trade.
Vstim is also [[Talik\|Talik's]] babsk before he is Rysn's; Talik attains the title of trademaster with him before moving to the Reshi Isles.
[[Iyatil\|Iyatil]] is [[Mraize\|Mraize's]] babsk and master. Both are members of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]].
