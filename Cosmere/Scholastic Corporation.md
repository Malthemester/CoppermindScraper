## Criticism
In July 2005, Scholastic determined that certain leases previously accounted for as operating leases should have been accounted for as capital leases. The cumulative effect, if recorded in the current year, would be material. As a result, it decided to restate its financial statements.
Scholastic has been criticized for inappropriately marketing to children, creating controversy. A significant number of titles carried have strong media tie-ins and are considered short in literary and artistic merit by some critics.
