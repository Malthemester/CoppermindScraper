>“*You will fall, Smedry! The Librarians will have your blood! It will be spilt on an altar to make the very Lenses we’ll use to destroy your kingdoms, break that which you love, and enslave those who follow you. You may have beaten me, but you will fall!*”
\-Kilimanjaro's last words before turning into a Curator [1]

## Appearance and Personality
Kiliman is about 7 feet tall and the entire left side of his body has been replaced with [[Alivened\|Alivened]] clockwork. His Alivened arm is much longer than his human arm. His left "eye" is made of dark Alivener's Glass. As a result of his transformation, he has a ragged voice. 

## Attributes and Abilities
Kilimanjaro isn't an Oculator, so he uses blood-forged lenses. His arsenal contains a Frostbringer's Lens, a Voidstormer's Lens, a Tracker's Lens and a Courier's Lens.
He is also a competent pilot, able to control an F15 fighter modified with ice-power dark Oculary.

## History
He is hired by an unknown Librarian to retrieve the [[Translator's Lenses\|Translator's Lenses]] that [[Alcatraz\|Alcatraz]] possessed at any cost; Alcatraz believed it was [[Shasta Smedry\|his mother]] who hired him. He chases Alcatraz from an airport in the hushlands in an F15 fighter that had been modified with dark Oculary. Alcatraz uses his breaking talent to completely destroy the jet, but he still manages to follow them to the [[Library of Alexandria\|Library of Alexandria]]. Alcatraz manages to lose him for a time by entering the library, but eventually Kiliman captures [[Draulin\|Draulin]], rips out her [[Fleshstone\|Fleshstone]] and uses her to force Alcatraz to hand over the Translator's Lenses. 
Alcatraz, [[Australia Smedry\|Australia]] and [[Bastille\|Bastille]] use the Discerner's Lenses to find the center of the library and thus also Kiliman. Australia uses her talent to change her form to resemble that of the [[Curators\|Curators]] of the library and sneaks past Kiliman to release [[Kazan Smedry\|Kaz]], who Kiliman has captured and tied up. [[Bastille\|Bastille]] cleverly uses a tripwire tied to one of the boots with Grappler's Glass to retrieve her mother's Fleshstone before tossing it to Kaz. Kaz then escapes with Australia and Draulin.
Alcatraz and Bastille continue to fight what appears to be a losing battle with Kiliman, but manage to retrieve the Translators lens when Bastille tackles him. Alcatraz finally defeats Kiliman by tricking him into pulling a book off a shelf by tying a piece of trip wire between the recovered Translator's Lenses and a scroll. As soon as Kiliman grabs the Translator's Lenses with his Voidstormer's Lens, the scroll falls from the shelf and Kiliman's soul is forfeit. Kilimanjaro becomes a Curator with half a skull and his mechanic parts fell apart.

## Trivia
His name is a reference to , the highest peak in Africa. The abbreviated form of his name could also be seen as a reference to his mission or purpose (Kill A Man).
