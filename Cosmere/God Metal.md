## Characteristics & Attributes
The God Metals are metals formed directly from a [[Shard\|Shard]] and can be made from any Shard. Creating a God Metal without a Shard is extremely difficult, but possible. They can be alloyed with the lesser metals to form sixteen different metals each, though few are known. They can also be alloyed with each other. Besides having an [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]], a [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]], and a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] property, each God Metal can also do something else. The existence of God Metals is one reason why metal is so weird in the cosmere.
A Mistborn could burn any God Metal, though doing so may require a [[Connection\|Connection]] to the metal's Shard. Some God Metals can be used by anyone.
If a Shard is [[Splinter\|Splintered]], God Metals that existed before will remain unaffected. The Vessel of the Shard can slightly change the properties of its God Metal over time, but not the main functions of what it does. The Ascension of a new Vessel will not necessarily cause the properties of the Shard's God Metal to change, though people might start calling the metal by a new name to reflect the new Vessel.

## Known God Metals
### Lerasium
[[Lerasium\|Lerasium]] is the God Metal corresponding to the Shard [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. A normal person burning lerasium becomes a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] of undiluted power. A Misting or Mistborn burning lerasium drastically increases their powers. [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] can use lerasium to store an unknown quality, and when used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, lerasium steals all abilities.

### Atium
[[Atium\|Atium]] is the God Metal corresponding to the Shard [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. An Allomancer burning atium is able to see into the future by a few seconds. Feruchemists can use atium to store youthfulness, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, atium can steal the power to use any Invested Art.


[[Malatium\|Malatium]] is an alloy of atium and [[Gold\|gold]]. An Allomancer burning malatium is able to see either who another person was in the past, or who they could have become if they had made different choices.

### Harmonium
[[Ettmetal\|Harmonium]] is the God Metal corresponding to the Shard [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. Called "ettmetal" in their native tongue, the Southern Scadrians use it to power their technology. Harmonium burns "with a pure whiteness" when used in Southern Scadrian machinery, and explodes when it is exposed to water (similar to the ) making it dangerous if not impossible to ingest for Allomantic purposes. Unlike alkali metal reactions, this reaction does not yield a "Harmonium oxide," but it will yield "something else relevant to the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]." Harmonium's atomic structure is that of a single element, rather than a compound or alloy.

### Raysium
[[Raysium\|Raysium]] is the God Metal of [[Odium\|Odium]]. Raysium can naturally conduct Investiture, drawing it in from any source.

### Trellium
[[Trellium\|Trellium]] is from a Shard currently known in the cosmere but which particular Shard is unknown. It is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust. Its Allomantic and Feruchemical properties are unknown. It can be used Hemalurgically to steal some, if not all, Allomantic and/or Feruchemical abilities and grant them to [[Kandra\|Kandra]]. It can also be used on humans to create Hemalurgic constructs. Kandra and Hemalurgic constructs with a single spike of trellium will be hidden from Harmony.

### Shardblades and Shardplate
[[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] are both made out of a mixture of the unnamed God Metals of [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. The precise proportion of the two differs depending on the type of [[Spren\|spren]] that forms the Blade, or the order to which the Plate belongs; as such, there are at least ten alloys. Like all God Metals, they are Allomantically viable, and thus burnable by a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], although it's yet to be seen what the effects would be. Presumably, they would also have Hemalurgic and Feruchemical effects.

### Honorblades
[[Honorblade\|Honorblades]] are made out of the God Metal of Honor.

### The Dor
The [[Dor\|Dor]] is the remnant of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion's]] combined powers after the Shards themselves were Splintered. There is a God Metal that comes from the Dor.

## Trivia
Striking a chime or bell made of a God Metal would not necessarily produce a similar note to that God Metal's corresponding Tone.
Brandon has indicated that the atium present in [[Mistborn Era 1\|Mistborn Era 1]] is actually an alloy of atium and [[Electrum\|electrum]].
