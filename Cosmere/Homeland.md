This page is on the homeland of the [[Forescout\|Forescouts]].¬†For the place where the [[Kandra\|kandra]] live, see [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]].
**Homeland** is the place of origin for many of the peoples who now live in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].
Its location is unknown, but it seems likely that it is across the sea from the Forests in the [[Fallen World\|Fallen World]].

## History
Three generations or more ago, the first people left Homeland to explore the Forests. These people took the surname [[Forescout\|Forescout]]. Sometime after that, the [[Evil\|Evil]] appeared in Homeland. It began to slaughter the people living in Homeland. The few people who survived fled Homeland and took refuge in the Forests. Some say that eventually the Forescouts will return to Homeland and defeat the Evil living there.

## Culture
Little is known about the way of life and culture of Homeland. People speak of it wistfully and tell fanciful stories about what it was like there, but most everyone who had ever seen Homeland have died. There is a general sense that ideals such as love and justice fell with the Homeland and have no place in the Forests.
The people of Homeland had a religion devoted to the [[God Beyond\|God Beyond]]. Its rites, doctrine, and even name are unknown. It was symbolized by a dagger. Some people had actual silver daggers as ornaments with symbols of the divine carved into it as a warding. Even in the Forests, some still worshiped the God Beyond and kept small altars to Him.
