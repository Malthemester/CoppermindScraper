**Destra** is a resident of [[New Seran\|New Seran]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
She lives with [[Templeton Fig\|Templeton Fig]], and it is implied that they are in a relationship. He does not see or treat her as his equal which is likely part of the reason she is timid and nervous around him. She is a thin, almost skeletal, woman, who has recently lost a fair bit of weight and outgrown her clothing.
