This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
[[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]], the former king of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and a member of the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]], possessed a collection of unusual spheres. Notably, he had several **black spheres** that glowed with a dark violet light.

For the sphere he considered "most important" and gave to [[Szeth\|Szeth]], see **Anti-Voidlight**
For the sphere he gave to [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]], see **Voidlight** or **Lights#Voidlight**
A [[Bav\|Bav]] worker named [[Took\|Took]] claimed to have stolen a similar dark sphere from the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. Took was known to exaggerate, and his story may be apocryphal.

## Trivia
The Anti-Voidlight sphere given to Szeth was first mentioned in the prologue of *The Way of Kings* in 2010. Fans often speculated about the contents of Szeth and Eshonai's spheres as subsequent books were released, usually theorizing that it was Voidlight or an [[Unmade\|Unmade]]. Brandon remained cagey on the subject and it was a decade until the contents of the spheres were confirmed in *Rhythm of War*.
