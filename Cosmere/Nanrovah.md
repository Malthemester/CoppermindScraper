\-Nanrovah[1]


**Nanrovah** is a priest in the [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]] prior to the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]].

## Appearance and Personality
Nanrovah wore the robes of a priest, in the colors of his god [[Stillmark\|Stillmark the Noble]], blue and gold.
Nanrovah is a traditionalist, like his god, and argues against most proposals brought forth in the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]]. He was well respected within the court. His father was one of the wealthiest merchants in Hallandren, and Nanrovah inherited his wealth from him, which means his gotes cannot be bought with coin.

## History
Nanrovah is high priest to [[Stillmark\|Stillmark the Noble]], and is notably the most outspoken of the priests against going to war with [[Idris\|Idris]]. He has met with [[Vasher\|Vasher]] previously, but did not immediately recognize him. Vasher asked him to oppose the war, a position he already held. Later, however, he unexpectedly changes his position, suddenly supporting the notion of war. This is due to a calculated attack on his carriage by [[Denth's crew\|Denth's crew]], who kidnap his daughter [[Misel\|Misel]], hold her hostage, and threaten to kill her if he doesn't stop openly opposing the war. After her rescue, Nanrovah is able to safely oppose the war again; however, because he had changed his opinion twice by then, the others don't take his arguments as seriously anymore.
