**Varanis** is a [[Listener\|listener]] lieutenant on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He serves under [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Varanis seems to be one of Eshonai's most trusted lieutenants. He is a disciplined, loyal soldier who typically wears [[Warform\|warform]]. After the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], he was one of the listeners selected by Eshonai to wear [[Stormform\|stormform]].

## History
Near the end of the War of Reckoning, Varanis was one of the soldiers tasked with creating paintings at the [[Hall of Art\|Hall of Art]] in [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]] in an attempt to attract [[Creationspren\|creationspren]] and perhaps learn how to take [[Artform\|artform]]. Eshonai chuckled at his game attempts to paint flowers while wearing [[Warform\|warform]].
After the coming of the Everstorm and Eshonai's transformation into stormform, she selected a very limited group of listeners to transform in the next storm, including [[Venli\|Venli]], other scholars, and two hundred low-level soldiers. She intentionally excluded officers and soldiers from her own division, who might have questioned her. However, Varanis was among the listeners that were scheduled for transformation in the next Everstorm. When [[Thude\|Thude]] and a group of dissenters (including [[Jaxlim\|Jaxlim]]) fled into the chasms, Varanis reported their escape to Eshonai, angering her.
Varanis presumably took on stormform alongside thousands of other listeners prior to the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and participated in the battle. [[Rlain\|Rlain]] was acquainted with Varanis and later mourned "losing" him along with Eshonai, Thude, and the other residents of Narak. However, it is unclear if Rlain believed that Varanis was dead or if he was speaking of loss metaphorically.
