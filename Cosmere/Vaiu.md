>“*Deadeyes cannot think, but they are still spren—bound to the spiritweb of Roshar herself. They can feel what is happening in this keep, that justice will finally be administered.*”
\-Vaiu[1]


**Vaiu** is an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] living in [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Vaiu is short with a full square beard and prefers to go around bare-chested, wearing only an old-style skirt a little like an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Takama\|takama]]. He carries a winged spear.

## History
Vaiu was one of [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] jailers in [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] when the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] tried Adolin for the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Along with [[Alvettaren\|Alvettaren]], he was one of Adolin's primary guards when Adolin walked around outside.
One day when they were escorting Adolin, Vaiu commented on the large number of [[Deadeye\|deadeyes]] gathered on the shore outside the capital. He explained to Adolin that they had let in as many as they could before having to shut out the rest. He wondered why so many deadeyes were congregating there, postulating that some [[Connection\|Connection]] to the [[Spiritweb\|Spiritweb]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] drew them to the keep to see justice done. After reminding Adolin that he had chosen to face his trial, Vaiu told him that he had better go study with [[Blended\|Blended]] for his defense.
