## Books
The first four books were originally published by [[Scholastic\|Scholastic]], one a year between 2007 and 2010. Scholastic would only agree to publish the first four books, not wishing to publish a fifth book with the Big Reveal which would then lead to a concluding sixth book written by Alcatraz's bodyguard. Brandon bought back the rights to the series and sold them to [[Tor\|Tor]], who agreed to publish all six books. The first four books were republished with new art during the first half of 2016. The fifth book, *The Dark Talent*, was then published in September 2016.

The end-node to *The Dark Talent* includes a letter penned by [[Bastille\|Bastille]], in which she states that there would an additional book written from her perspective in order to tie up everything properly. The tentative title for the final book is *Alcatraz Bastille versus the Evil Librarians: The Worldspire*. Brandon had some trouble getting Bastille's voice right, so he reached out to his long-time friend and former student, [[Janci Patterson\|Janci Patterson]], who agreed to help with the book. After that, the two made "significant progress," and the book is almost done.
