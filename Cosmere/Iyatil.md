\-Iyatil[2]


**Iyatil** is a member of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]], a secret organization on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She purports to be [[Mraize\|Mraize's]] master, instead of the other way around, and is thus presumably a high-ranking member of the organization. Though she currently lives on Roshar, she is originally from [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]]. She has Southern Scadrian ancestry, and the mask she wears is similar to those worn by the Hunters nation.

## Abilities and Attributes
Not much is known about Iyatil's abilities. She is confident that she can escape from an Alethi facility without assistance. After she attempts to assassinate [[Amaram\|Amaram]], she is described as moving "too quickly" to be chased. She has also been confirmed to be a worldhopper, supervising [[Mraize\|Mraize]].

## History
Roshar is not Iyatil's home planet; she is of Southern Scadrian heritage, though she comes from [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] rather than from Scadrial. At some point she was a member of the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]].
By 1173, Iyatil was a high-ranking member of the Ghostbloods and lived on Roshar. She was present at Shallan's first meeting with the Ghostbloods and followed Shallan after the meeting, trying to track her back to [[Tyn\|Tyn]]. She later accompanied Shallan on a mission for the Ghostbloods, investigating the recent arrival of [[Talenel\|Talenel]] to the Alethi warcamps. After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], she attempted to assassinate Highlord [[Amaram\|Amaram]] with a blowgun. Her attempt was foiled by [[Talenel\|Talenel]], but she managed to escape.
She was interested in speaking to [[Shalash\|Shalash]]. Her associate Mraize was charged with trying to contact her.
