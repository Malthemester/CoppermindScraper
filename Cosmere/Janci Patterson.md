## Works
Janci's first published novel was *Chasing the Skip* (later renamed *Skipped*) in 2012. She has written contemporary and science fiction books in the young adult category, and coauthored adult romance novels and adult fantasy novels.

## Collaboration
For years, Brandon has mentioned Janci as an influence on his female characters, notably [[Vin\|Vin]]. She helped Brandon fix a scene in *The Hero of Ages*, which led to him renaming a character Lady [[Patresen\|Patresen]] as a cameo.
She provided Brandon with feedback on the *Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians* novels throughout the series. The final novel in the series, *The Worldspire*, is written from [[Bastille\|Bastille's]] point of view, and Brandon had difficulty settling in on her voice. He thought of Janci as a good fit to help him coauthor the book, since he was seeking a different voice but a similar tone and spirit to the rest of the series. The duo worked on the novel from 2018 to 2020, with each author writing about half of the book. The book was completed and sold to Tor Books in 2020, and is expected to be published in 2022.
Janci also co-wrote three *Skyward* novellas that accompanied the release of *Cytonic* and was the one who selected which characters each of them will be focused on. The novellas are *Sunreach*, *ReDawn*, and *Evershore*; featuring [[FM\|FM]], [[Alanik\|Alanik]], and [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] respectively.

## Process
Janci and Brandon brainstormed the novellas together, then Janci did most of the outlining, tossing different ideas around with Brandon. Then Janci wrote almost all of the first draft, with Brandon doing a redline edit.
