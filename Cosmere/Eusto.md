**Captain Eusto** is an [[Eelakin\|Eelakin]] working for [[Northern Interests Trading Company\|Northern Interests Trading Company]] on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]].

## History
Eusto was the captain of the most recent [[Patji expedition\|Patji expedition]], commanding one of the Company's large steam-powered ships known as an [[Ironhull\|ironhull]]. Like previous expeditions, Eusto's team sailed from the [[Eelakin Islands\|homeisles]] to the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]] seeking to establish a permanent outpost on [[Patji (island)\|Patji]], due to the valuable [[Aviar\|Aviar]] that live there. [[Vathi\|Vathi]], who has a scientific background, noted that Eusto was not fond of her presence on the expedition because he was concerned that she would usurp his authority.
Historically, only [[Trapper\|trappers]] had been able to survive in the Pantheon due to an array of incredibly dangerous predators, but the Company had new weapons and other technology that originated with the [[Ones Above\|Ones Above]]. They were able to kill a [[Deepwalker\|deepwalker]] and build a fortress on Patji. A scouting team was sent to find a location for a second fortress, but it was destroyed, stranding Vathi in the jungle; she assumed Eusto was very happy that she did not return.
Eusto's expedition also brought a large, complex machine that originated with the Ones Above; it was capable of mapping the location of Aviar on the island. The crew did not understand the machine and inadvertently activated it, causing significant distress to the Aviar.
