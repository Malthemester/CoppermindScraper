>“*I'm … supposed to stay. I'm not supposed to talk. To you. To anyone.*”
\-Ala to Shallan[1]


**Ala** is a [[Seon\|seon]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Like all seons, Ala appears as a glowing ball of light, with its namesake [[Aon\|Aon]] at the center. It seems traumatized by the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] and acts like an abused child, reluctant to come out of its cube or speak to anyone.

## History
Ala was kept in a metal cube by [[Mraize\|Mraize]], and was given to [[Shallan\|Shallan]] for use as a communication device between realms before her expedition to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. After speaking with [[Hoid\|Hoid]], Shallan, with help from [[Kalak\|Kalak]], was eventually able to free Ala from the cube without harming it.
