**Pahn Kahl** is a small territory under the control of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. The Pahn Kahl form a distinct but often overlooked group within the culturally dominant Hallandren, with a separate language and religion. They were formerly an independent country, but were absorbed into Hallandren after their defeat in the [[Manywar\|Manywar]]. Three centuries later, many of the Pahn Kahl still longed for independence.

## Geography
For more information, see [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
Pahn Kahl is located on the shores of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]], an enclosed ocean within the continent. Originally, only the Pahn Kahl inhabited the valley between two mountain ranges. The land has a perpetually warm climate, and is dominated by tropical jungles and sandy beaches. Delicious fruit grew plentifully, as well as the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]], a flower that can be used to create brilliant dyes. Gradually, other peoples came to the area and founded a second kingdom, gradually restricting Pahn Kahl's territory and autonomy. By the year 321, all that remained of Pahn Kahl's territory is a small province in the south of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].

## History
### Early History
The earliest Pahn Kahl people lived in the jungles and on the shores of the Bright Sea. They were the first people in that region of Nalthis, and they controlled the land, although they had little in the way of a centralized government. Instead, they were a loosely organized group of fishing villages. With the explorations of the people of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]], the Pahn Kahl's homeland became better known. When [[Vo\|Vo]] was [[Returned\|Returned]], the first in the history of Nalthis, a second kingdom was founded in the valley by Vo's shipmates. They named the kingdom [[Hanald\|Hanald]] and crowned Vo's wife queen.

### Manywar and Subjugation
For more information, see [[Manywar\|Manywar]].
Years later, Pahn Kahl's neighbor Hanald gave control of its [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] army to a powerful [[Awakener\|Awakener]] named [[Kalad\|Kalad]], who was also Returned. After a vision of a coming war, Kalad wrested control of the nation away from Vo's royal descendants and started a preemptive war against other nations. The Pahn Kahl generally hold that this war was the fault of Hanald's royal family, who they accuse of seeking new [[Awakening\|Awakening]] techniques and [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] without realizing these could be turned against them.
Pahn Kahl joined the coalition of countries named the [[Pahn Unity\|Pahn Unity]], a group of kingdoms united in their desire to defeat Hanald. The Pahn Unity was defeated and the nation of Pahn Kahl was subjugated, its people made into workers and slaves.
Eventually Kalad, then known as Peacegiver, came to regret the bloodshed and ended the war. The former royal family of Hanald seceded, forming a separate kingdom called [[Idris\|Idris]] in the mountains, and the kingdom of Hanald, now ruled by the Returned, was renamed [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. Pahn Kahl remained under the control of Hallandren, and over time the Pahn Kahl people became heavily associated with their conquerors, with few outside of Pahn Kahl understanding or caring about the difference between the two peoples.

### Failed Rebellions
*For more information see Vahr, and the Pahn Kahl rebellion.*

>‚Äú* You're from Pahn Kahl, yet everyone always just assumes that your people are Hallandren. The Pahn Kahl people were here first, in this land, but it was taken from you. Now you're just another province, part of the kingdom of your conquerors.*‚Äù
\- Siri to Bluefingers[5]


Despite their defeat, the Pahn Kahl were not content to remain subjugated. Approximately three hundred years after the defeat of the Pahn Unity, around the year 321, a Pahn Kahl man named Vahr began to foment rebellion among the Pahn Kahl dye workers and dissidents. He convinced many of them to give him their [[Breath\|Breath]] and began to assemble an army. Little to Vahr's knowledge, a second group of Pahn Kahl, led by the God King [[Susebron\|Susebron's]] steward, [[Havarseth\|Havarseth]], were also independently plotting a rebellion. Havarseth, also known as Bluefingers, felt that Vahr's rebellion was drawing too much attention to the Pahn Kahl people. Bluefingers leaked information about Vahr into the [[Court of the Gods\|Court of the Gods]] resulting in Vahr's capture and the end of his rebellion.
Bluefingers's own rebellion was far more subtle than Vahr's. As he did not have his own army, he instead conspired to instigate a war between Hallandren and Idris, hoping that in the fighting Pahn Kahl could declare independence and break away. Due to his high-level position as the God King's steward, Bluefingers was in the perfect position to manipulate events, and his actions were often overlooked or ignored because of his race.
Bluefingers sneaked Pahn Kahl Awakeners into the Court through tunnels to begin Breaking the [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] in Hallandren's armies. He later used these Lifeless, along with mercenaries and Pahn Kahl scribes disguised as priests to take control of the God King's palace and capture both the God King and his wife, [[Sisirinah\|Sisirinah]]. He also gained control of the rest of Hallandren's forty thousand Lifeless soldiers by forcing the Returned gods [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] and [[Blushweaver\|Blushweaver]] to reveal their Commands. These Lifeless were then Commanded to march on Idris to start a new war.
Bluefingers intended to kill both Blushweaver and Lightsong then plant their corpses surrounded by Idrian bodies, making it appear as if Idrian rebels had killed them in retaliation for deploying the Lifeless against Idris. He also intended to kill both Siri and Susebron and make it appear as if the God King had his wife sacrificed on an altar and had been killed by vengeful Idrian assassins.
However, Lightsong thwarted these plans by healing the God King's maimed tongue with his [[Divine Breath\|divine Breath]], allowing Susebron to finally make use of his incredibly strong BioChroma to save Siri, and defeat the Pahn Kahl rebels. Peacegiver, who had been attempting to prevent this conflict on his own in the guise of Vasher, gave Susebron control of his ancient army of Lifeless, [[Kalad's Phantoms\|Kalad's Phantoms]]. Susebron used this army to defeat the Lifeless soldiers that were marching on Idris, preventing the war between the two kingdoms and quashing the Pahn Kahl rebellion.

## Culture
### People and Language
The Pahn Kahl are racially different from the dominantly Hallandren population. They have a different skin tone and facial features than the Hallandren. They are also shorter on average than the Hallandren as well. Pahn Kahl also have their own speech. Its words are full of airy sounds. Despite these differences, they are often mistaken for Hallandren, to their irritation.

### Role in Hallandren Society
Within the kingdom of Hallandren, the Pahn Kahl were often ignored, seen as second class citizens typically less trustworthy than the Hallandren. On the other hand, many not familiar with the Pahn Kahl may struggle to differentiate the Pahn Kahl from the other Hallandren; oftentimes they are not seen as their own distinct people. This confusion is a great annoyance to them. The Pahn Kahl are often marginalized by the Hallandren, and are very frustrated with being ignored and subjugated by them. This is especially infuriating to them as the Pahn Kahl were the first people in the region, and have been conquered by relative newcomers.
Many of the Pahn Kahl live a difficult life, working under harsh overseers in the dye fields. Some have managed to work their way into high importance but low prestige jobs, such as stewards and servants for the priests and Returned in the [[Court of the Gods\|Court of the Gods]]. This provides a far better life than working in the dye fields. This work is however unstable, anytime a new God King is chosen, all his workers lose their jobs. In addition to this, Pahn Kahl servants have to work harder to gain jobs within the theocracy, and those jobs are often more difficult than the Hallandren servants. They all required to wear brown robes and are forbidden to speak to or touch the God King himself. In fact they are not even permitted to be servants to the God King, although they may be servants for his wife. Pahn Kahl are also not permitted to serve as priests to the gods either.
All these things have led to their rebellious spirit and their desire for revenge and freedom. Consumed by their anger, as well as their desire for independence, the Pahn Kahl have lost much of their cultural identity..

### Religion
The Pahn Kahl religion has similarities with the [[Iridescent Tones\|Iridescent Tones]], but is more abstract and does not include worship of the [[Returned\|Returned]]. Rather, it involves a kind of nature worship where the storms of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]] are revered as manifestations of the unity of their five gods. Their religion also has more a focus on the Voice that calls the Returned, that is actually Endowment. It is uncertain how they relate this Voice to their five gods.
In their theology, the [[Returned\|Returned]] are those who lived just lives but died lacking in faith. They are forbidden entrance into heaven but are not sent to hell. Instead, they are given a second chance to find the true faith in life by Returning. Many of the Pahn Kahl do not mind the Returned, and accept the God King as monarch. They simply see the Returned as misguided. Since they do not see them as divinities, the only thing the Pahn Kahl find extraordinary about the Returned is the strength of their [[BioChroma\|BioChroma]].
Many outsiders consider the Pahn Kahl religion to be simplistic, especially in contrast with the elaborate doctrine of the [[Iridescent Tones\|Iridescent Tones]]. In fact, many people in Hallandren and beyond have no understanding of the religion or are not even aware that the Pahn Kahl have their own separate religion at all. Unfortunately, some aspects of the Pahn Kahl religion have been forgotten even by its followers, due in part to their single-minded desire for independence from Hallandren.

### Cuisine
Only one example of Pahn Kahl cuisine is currently known. The sweet pastries called [[Tinkfan\|tinkfans]] are considered to be a delicacy. They are even eaten by the Returned in the Court of the Gods. Tinkfans are traditionally consumed in small bites, with a small piece of bread eaten between each bite as a palate cleanser.

## Trivia
Brandon often adds an additional "h" to Pahn Kahl words in order to distinguish them and make them sound "airier".
One of Brandon's concerns is that he made the Pahn Kahl too forgettable to the reader as well, lessening the impact of their rebellion.
One of the things that would be explored further in [[Nightblood (book)\|Nightblood]], the sequel to [[Warbreaker\|Warbreaker]] is the Pahn Kahl and their culture.
