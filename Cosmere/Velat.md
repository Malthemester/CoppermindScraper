## History
### War of Reckoning
During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Velat likely lived in the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Towards the end of the war, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] was escorted onto the plateaus by [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] troops so that she could observe a [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]] chrysalis. When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and Shallan became stranded in a chasm, she told him that she did not have any maps with her because she had been using maps that she borrowed from Velat.
Velat was presumably among a large group of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] scribes and cartographers that accompanied him as he led a scouting expedition into the Shattered Plains. This group of scholars, including the royal cartographer [[Isasik Shulin\|Isasik Shulin]], was later co-opted by Shallan and [[Navani\|Navani]] as they attempted to determine the location of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] at [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]].
When the expedition approached [[Narak\|Narak]], Velat worked with [[Inadara\|Inadara]] and Isasik to interpret a map of the inner portion of the Shattered Plains drawn by Shallan. However, Shallan's map was not completely accurate, and new information from a scout ultimately allowed Shallan to pinpoint the location of the Oathgate.

### True Desolation
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], Velat moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and continued working as a cartographer for the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. She participated in early missions of the *Fourth Bridge*, working with engineers to chart out courses for the airship. She had some apprehension about flying on the ship, but she was the best cartographer available because Isasik was busy with other tasks. While the *Fourth Bridge* was underway, she tethered herself to the deck; she wished that Navani would do the same. She also provided maps to other members of the coalition, including [[Dieno enne Calah\|Dieno enne Calah]].
