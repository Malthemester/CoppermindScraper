**Ashe** is a [[Seon\|seon]], a magical being on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He is bonded to [[Sarene\|Sarene]].

## Appearance and Personality
Like all seons, Ashe is a sentient, melon-sized ball of light. The glowing character Aon Ashe forms the center of Ashe's body, although it is partially obscured by his light. He has a deep voice, always perfectly enunciating his words.
Ashe is reserved and cautious, and often displays displeasure when he perceives Sarene to be acting recklessly. He concerns himself with Sarene's safety above all and cares for her very much.
He considers [[Teod\|Teod]] his home, though he moves to [[Arelon\|Arelon]] with Sarene after her marriage to [[Raoden\|Raoden]]. He lived in Arelon for a brief time, long before being bound to Sarene.

## History
Ashe plays a key role in Sarene's efforts to thwart [[Hrathen\|Hrathen's]] takeover of Arelon. Among other things, Ashe deduces that Raoden is the one truly in charge of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], saves Sarene from [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jesker cultists]] by alerting [[Eondel\|Eondel]] of her whereabouts, acts as a courier between Sarene and [[Kiin\|Kiin]] while she is temporarily sequestered in Elantris, and gives Raoden the exact trajectory necessary for him to teleport to Teod and rescue Sarene from [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] and his [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]] monks.
