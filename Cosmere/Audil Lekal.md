**Audil Lekal** was the second king of the kingdom formed by [[Jastes Lekal\|Jastes Lekal]], who was his nephew.
In the months before the [[Siege of Fadrex City\|siege of Fadrex City]], [[Elend\|Elend]] sent [[Breeze\|Breeze]] and [[Sazed\|Sazed]] to King Lekal to have him officially bend the knee and swear his fealty to the empire. He did this reservedly, and [[Sazed\|Sazed]] noted how his signature on the treaty was incredibly cramped, as he knew he had been beaten and had no choice but to join [[Elend\|Elend's]] empire or die, regardless of his own problems with the agreement.
His kingdom was destroyed by lava from an ashmount
