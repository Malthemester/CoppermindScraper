**Snapping** is the process by which someone gains the powers of [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Snapping commonly occurs when a Misting or Mistborn undergoes heavy stress and pain, often in a near-death situation, causing them to trigger latent Allomantic abilities. According to [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]], this creates a crack on the soul which the power can fit into. There are some similarities on this to other magic systems, such as the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] all being "broken" as indicated by [[Syl\|Syl]].
In the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], children of confirmed noble bloodlines often undergo a planned beating as a test to see if they Snap. Later, however, the mists cause sickness in people, triggering their own Snapping; this process is started by [[Preservation\|Preservation]], but is manipulated by [[Ruin\|Ruin]] into killing people, thus raising superstitions about the mists being dangerous.
The length a person has "mist sickness" relates to their Allomantic powers and abilities. The most powerful [[Atium\|atium]] mistings are sick for the longest time.
During the time the mists are Snapping people in [[The Hero of Ages\|The Hero of Ages]], they also raise the Allomantic potential of the people they Snap so that exactly 16% are Snapped. The number is a hint left by Preservation for humans to understand.
At some point after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]], [[Harmony\|Harmony]] is disturbed by the process of Snapping and alters the way it operates, but it is not clear how Snapping works now.
