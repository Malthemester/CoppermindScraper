## Appearance and Personality
She is short, with a shaggy mane and brown coat. She is very calm and primarily interested in eating grass and other plants.

## History
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] chose her as his mount when he was learning to ride a horse. Spray was docile but somewhat stubborn, and she was unwilling to go faster despite Kaladin's urging. [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] was riding his [[Ryshadium\|Ryshadium]] [[Sureblood\|Sureblood]] nearby and lightly mocked Kaladin, remarking that Spray was fast in her youth, but was at least fifteen years old and was best suited to children.
Kaladin decided that he needed to try to ride a faster horse, and dismounted Spray in favor of [[Dreamstorm\|Dreamstorm]], despite [[Jenet\|Jenet's]] warnings against doing so. He was bucked off of Dreamstorm, and he returned to Spray.
