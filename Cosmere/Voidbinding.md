**Voidbinding** is a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] of which little is known. It is connected to [[Odium\|Odium]] and his [[Unmade\|Unmade]], and predicting the future is said to be of it. [[Khriss\|Khriss's]] writings in the [[Ars Arcanum\|Ars Arcanum]] states that there are ten levels of Voidbinding and that it is cousin to the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]].

## Prerequisites
Not much is known about how one becomes a Voidbinder under normal circumstances. It has been said that Voidbinding usually, though not always, originates with the Unmade. Parts of Voidbinding have been looked into in the past, but it likely has not been fully explored.
A possible example of a method of becoming a Voidbinder is by bonding with a corrupted [[Nahel bond\|Nahel spren]]. [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin's]] ability to see the future seems to be connected to Voidbinding, and it is likely he gained it through his bond to the corrupted spren [[Glys\|Glys]]. How much Renarin's abilities relate to Voidbinding is currently unclear.
It is "theoretically possible" for a [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] to imitate at least some parts of Voidbinding.

## Mythology
One of the most common powers associated with Voidbinding is prophecy and foresight. According to the [[Ardent\|ardents]], even the [[Herald\|Heralds]] denounced its use. Whether or not this is true or a myth is yet to be seen, although [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] believes this to be true. Regardless, in [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nations, *any* type of prediction is considered to be taboo. The ardents worried that [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] were connected to Voidbinding, although since the visions come from [[Honor\|Honor]], that was an unfounded concern.
The Vorin reluctance to guess the future led to the rise of games like breakneck, that don't require directly guessing the future. Many Vorins are distrustful of [[Stormwarden\|stormwardens]], since they predict when [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] are going to occur.

## Abilities
Very little is known about the abilities of Voidbinding. While Khriss says that there are ten levels to Voidbinding and refers to "Voidbindings", it is unknown what this means.
[[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin's]] ability to see the future is related to the Voidbinding chart, though the precise relationship between his powers and Voidbinding remains unclear.
While details on the ability are sparse, Renarin's future sight is shown to be imperfect, as the events he foresaw during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] did not come to pass. It seems to also in some way be fueled by [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]].

### Voidish Surges
There are glyphs on the Voidbinding chart that share position with and are variations of the Surge glyphs on the [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] chart. Instead of the axial symmetry of the Surge glyphs, the glyphs on the Voidbinding chart exhibit rotational symmetry. It may be that these glyphs represent either alternatives to, or variant expressions of, the Surges in Surgebinding.
As Renarin Kholin is apparently unable to use the Surge of [[Illumination\|Illumination]] in the manner normal [[Order of Truthwatchers\|Truthwatchers]] do, it is possible that his visions of the future come from this hypothetical "Voidish" expression of the Surge of Illumination.

### Regals
Nightform, one of the [[Regal\|Regal]] forms of power, was said to allow for foreseeing the future. This suggests a possible relation to Voidbinding, and may have implications about the other forms of power.
