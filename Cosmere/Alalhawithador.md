## Appearance and Personality
Alalhawithador's appearance is unknown; it communicates with the other Sleepless in a low, angry buzz. It is aggressive, and eager to rush to the most violent solution; [[Nikli\|Nikli]] considers it to be the most volatile of all Rosharan swarms. Nonetheless, Alalhawithador appreciates Nikli's fondness for humans, although this is mostly because it believes this will let Nikli blend in among them much better. When faced with failure, Alalhawithador is acerbic and accusatory.

## Abilities and Attributes
>“*More of us should spend time studying humans, to become like them.*”
\-Alalhawithador[1]


Alalhawithador is a [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]], a hive mind of hordelings, which it can breed to fulfill specific purposes. As its cognitive functions are spread across multiple hordelings, this makes it effectively immortal. Indeed, despite being the third swarm to have been Separated from the original, Alalhawithador is still alive.
Despite -- or perhaps because of -- its old age, Alalhawithador considers itself bad at imitating humans; or, at least, far worse at it than Nikli. However, it's confident in its combat skills, and believes itself capable of killing a whole crew of humans, including two [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].

## History
Alalhawithador is the third Sleepless to have been Separated after the species came to the planet, making it almost as old as the First, [[Yelamaiszin\|Yelamaiszin]]. Over the millennia, it remained loyal to Yelamaiszin and helped protect [[Akinah\|Akinah]] and its hidden [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]].
When *Wandersail* sailed for Akinah, Alalhawithador went along with Nikli's initial plan to simply warn them off with manufactured omens. However, after the second attempt failed, it lost patience and began to push for killing all humans on board. When the swarms got sidetracked into discussing humans at large, Alalhawithador pulled them back on track, and pointed out that *First Dreams*, the ship whose recovery prompted the expedition, was likely deliberately placed so that someone would find it.
Alalhawithador's plans for the crew of *Wandersail* involved letting them make landing on the beach and then letting its swarm kill them all. While this plan was initially dismissed, it's likely that Alalhawithador participated in the battle between the humans and the Sleepless before [[Rysn\|Rysn]] was able to forge a truce.
