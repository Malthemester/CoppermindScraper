The **Slatra** is a type of ship used by the [[DDF\|DDF]]. Although considered a [[Starfighter\|starfighter]], they are closer to cargo or shuttle ships than fighter jets. The Slatra has multiple shield igniters that allows for it to constantly have a barrier surrounding its cargo or passengers. They are bulky ships that are not suitable in battle against the [[Varvax\|Krell]] as they are slower and more cumbersome than enemy vehicles.
[[Spensa\|Spensa]] trained on a Slatra during flight school. She thought it was inferior to [[M-Bot\|M-Bot]], and found it to be slow and commonplace.
