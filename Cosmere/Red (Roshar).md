## Appearance and Personality
He is a lanky [[Alethi\|Alethi]] man with a beard, and does not have red hair. It is unclear where he gets the nickname Red from. He is tall and has light violet eyes. Before becoming a Lightweaver he was a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]]. He wears darkeyed worker's clothing (brown trousers, a buttoned shirt with sleeves rolled up, with bright suspenders).
Red likes to laugh, and gets a lot of Shallan's jokes. He enjoys doing his work well, but also like to chat and sit around. Despite this, he does want to be helpful, and is often the first to be working.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]], Red can use the Surges of **Illumination** and **Transformation**.

### Soulcasting
The [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] enters (or partially enters) the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] to convince the sentience of an object to change materials, transforming it into something else if successful. Some transformations are more basic than others, with more complicated transformations requiring a more skilled Surgebinder and more [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]].

### Lightweaving
Lightweaving deals in illusions. It involves the manipulation of waves of sound or light and has a strong [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] component requiring a certain measure of [[Connection\|Connection]] and a full mental picture of the desired illusion.

## History
Red is one of the deserters picked up by [[Shallan\|Shallan]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. He left Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] army because he felt like it stopped being a war of retribution, and was a game for spheres for the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]].
Red lived in Highprince [[Vamah\|Vamah's]] princedom, in the city of [[Farcoast\|Farcoast]], near [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. Highprince Vamah gave the call to arms to the citizens of Farcoast himself. Red joined the army with five of his friends to get revenge, but also because of the pressure. Every man of age in his area was signing up, so it almost marked you a coward not to have a recruit patch, according to Red. After leaving the army Red no longer thinks of himself as a real soldier, even after joining Shallan's Guard, where he has an official uniform he will usually wear..
Red makes an attempt at flirting with Veil, though gives up after not much time. Red is definitely a nice person, one that likes talking to people and making friends in general, going out drinking and gambling, though he does not like Horneater Lager, as most sane Alethi don't. He is very cheerful, and even after he accepts Veil as a friend offers to let her have one of the drinks on his ration. He likes Shallan the best out of the group, as he is the most friendly of them, being more friendly than [[Vathah\|Vathah]], [[Gaz\|Gaz]], or [[Shob\|Shob]]. When Veil is talking about how annoying and strange Shallan is, Red does not join in on the conversation, while others do. When Gaz is talking about his past as a bridge sergeant Red is encouraging him, saying that Gaz was the perfect sergeant. It is hard to tell if he is joking or not, but he seems to be, because he is smiling as he says this.

### Urithiru
Red spends his time in Urithiru lounging around in the common room gambling with the other men of Shallan's Guard. He doesn't seem to do much, mostly left to his own devices while Shallan does other things. Despite this, he still has a good time, and doesn't complain about not doing anything, as he doesn't seem to think he is worthy of his role as the Honor Guard of a [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]]. It is likely that he talks to the other soldiers in this common room, as he is a very nice, amiable person that is generally well liked. He also could avoid talking with them much, especially [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] soldiers because of his insecurities about his job and role in the Tower.
Red is one of the three men chosen to learn from [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]], who is a spy. He is chosen along with Gaz and Vathah. He mostly was interested in learning to use knives, calling them deevy. When training he is asked to close his eyes and describe the people in the tavern he is in. Instead of really doing this, he describes Gaz, calling him annoying, short and ugly, just to have some fun. After this he starts to try, because he wants to do what he is supposed to and help Shallan. After a while he is seemingly very confused, though acts like he is not, just nodding and trying to do what he can.
After being trained for a while Red is then chosen to go to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] with another of Shallan's Guards, Vathah. He is chosen because of his training and because of Gaz and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] relationship. He does not seem to have complaints about going, though we don't see him and Shallan's interaction when he is asked to go. It is probable that he went without complaint, though he likely asked some questions, because of his eagerness to be helpful and do things, really anything he is asked to do. It is not described how he reacts to flying all the way to Kholinar, except that he is bundled up like everyone else.

### Siege of Kholinar
The true purpose of bringing Red on the mission to Kholinar, as well as Vathah and Ishnah, is unknown to all but Shallan and King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], who insisted that he come. This reason is the fact that he has rudimentary training in espionage, and can hopefully help out with gathering information if necessary. Upon finding out that Veil and Shallan are the same person, he only laughs, as is characteristic of him. After this he doesn't seem to do that much, also just lounging around and hanging out with Ishnah and Vathah, learning some more. He may occasionally go out with Veil on her expeditions into the city, but usually not.
In Kholinar he continues his learning, and is able to let Veil and Vathah know when they can attempt their heist and when to hide without others knowing. When Veil is hit by a crossbow bolt, all he does is point out that the blood is staining her outfit, ignoring the fact that she was shot in the head and still perfectly fine. This seems to be a coping method, and he doesn't say anything after this for the rest of the day, as he was quite shocked. After this he does still help on her other missions to steal food from people, and it doesn't seem to change his overall opinions of Shallan or Veil, only put him in shock.
Red is left in Kholinar, along with Ishnah and Vathah. He does not seem to be showing signs of being a [[Squire\|Squire]] to Shallan, though it is possible. It is unknown what happens to him after Shallan leaves, though he is able to find a merchant with a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] and join him, eventually being picked up by Kaladin after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]]. This group consists of [[Skar\|Skar]], [[Drehy\|Drehy]], Red, [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]], [[Vathah\|Vathah]] and the little [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]].

### Pursuing the Sons of Honor
Red embedded himself in the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]] using the illusion of a dark-eyed woman. He is not considered important enough to warrant an audience with [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]]. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] disguised herself as [[Chanasha Hasareh\|Chanasha Hasareh]] in an attempt to get brought into the Sons of Honor, which succeeded. Red is amongst the group that interrogated Shallan. Shallan is later brought to the Sadeas warcamp and Red is not amongst the group.

### Singer occupation of Urithiru
Red is left in charge of the [[Unseen Court\|Unseen Court]] while [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Beryl\|Beryl]], [[Vathah\|Vathah]], and [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]] undertake the mission to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. He was called upon by [[Navani\|Navani]] to identify [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]], who was caught delivering a mysterious [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]. Red is among the first [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] to collapse due to the corruption of the [[Sibling\|Sibling]].
