## Characteristics & Attributes
### Realms
Visions are almost like glimpsing into the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], but viewed through the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. This is done by a person being pulled through the Realms into the Spiritual Realm, with the Cognitive Realm adding framework to seeds set in place. This allows the person to interact with the vision, and for the vision to respond, similar to an AI. Almost anything can be shown in a vision. Visions can also be used for meetings, creating a near empty void just for communicating with others.
Visions may be a type of pocket dimension in the Spiritual Realm and are considered a warping of the Realms. Due to this, time may slow in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] when a vision is occurring. Visions do not change the past or create alternate timelines.

### Creation
Those with the ability are able to induce visions on their targets. In order to bring a person into a vision, a strong [[Connection\|Connection]] must be made. This may require a conduit (such as the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], [[Highstorm\|Highstorm]], or access via someone else Connected to them) if the Connection between the two is not strong enough. For [[Shard\|Shards]], targeting lone individuals requires a high level on Connection.

### Mechanics
Those pulled into a vision have little control over it and often can't refuse. However, they may be able to pull in those they are bonded with. Those pulled into a vision manifest via their mind and soul, ignoring physical aliments.
Those who a brought into a vision can bring some things with them (such as the [[Thrill\|Thrill]], [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], or [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]]), though some things cannot be brought (such as [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]]). Things affected in a vision will carry over after exiting one, such as paper being torn in a vision remaining torn after leaving the vision. Likewise, some entities inside a vision can still be harmed or killed. Accents might not carry over inside of visions.


Some individuals are able to control the visions of others, entering, leaving, and removing others on their own without the creators authority. They can also be messed with under certain inhibitors, such as [[Suppression fabrial\|suppression fabrials]].

## Honor's Visions
For more information, see [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]].
[[Honor\|Honor]], via the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]], sent [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] to both Gavilar and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] during every highstorm. These visions feel real to them, and they experienced them as themselves, but other people in the visions see them as someone else, not as an outsider. At the end of every one of them, they hear the voice of Honor speaking to them, commanding them to "unite them." As the visions are pre-recorded, they cannot communicate with Honor. They were selected to see these visions as part of being on the path of becoming a [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]]. After [[Nahel bond\|bonding]] with the Stormfather, Dalinar was able to control and chose who experiences the visions and able to bring other people into the visions with him.

## Odium's Visions
[[Odium\|Odium]] can bring others into vision, which he used often to communicate with them directly. When used for communication, Odium typically creates a vast field of golden light and stone.
Notably, Odium was demonstrated to be vulnerable during his visions, allowing him to be slayed by Nightblood. This shattered the vision, leaving a dark void, within which [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] was able to ascend to the Shard of Odium.

## Preservation's Visions
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], as [[Preservation\|Preservation]], was able to pull a semi-comatose [[Spook\|Spook]] into a "half dream" of how the world once was to communicate vital information to Spook about how to defeat [[Ruin\|Ruin]].

## Renarin's Visions
[[Renarin\|Renarin]] is able to show a person an alternate version of themselves, similar to the effect of [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]] [[Gold\|gold]] or [[Malatium\|malatium]]. This manifests as an illusory image of the target's alternate self standing within a cloud of bright white light.
