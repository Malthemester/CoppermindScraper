## Appearance and Personality
She is very short. She has a sense of humor, unlike many scribes.

## History
She was on duty at the [[Narak\|Narak]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] on the day that [[Skar\|Skar]] and [[Lyn\|Lyn]] became Radiant squires. She used a ledger to note who traveled through the Oathgate, and chided a tardy [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] on behalf of the waiting merchants. When he said to tell them that the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] are not "their doormen," she smirked and wrote something down, as if to tell the merchants exactly that.
Skar liked her sense of humor, and the two later started dating. Because Kaladin liked intelligent women and did not care about height, [[Adolin\|Adolin]] thought Ristina could have been a good match for him had she not been with Skar.

## Trivia
Skar is a cameo for Brandon's friend [[Ethan Skarstedt\|Ethan Skarstedt]], and Ristina may be a cameo for his wife Kristina.
