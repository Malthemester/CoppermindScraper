**Ked** works for Brightlord [[Paladar\|Paladar]] in the human bunker in [[Revolar\|Revolar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during its occupation by the [[Singer\|singers]].
They are presumably [[Alethi\|Alethi]] and [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]], as they were put in charge of organizing the guards in Paladar's tents and were responsible for placing [[Guff\|Guff]] on guard duty. After Guff brought [[Moash\|Moash]] to see the Brightlord and Moash did not respond to questioning, Paladar had Guff beaten and ordered Ked to post a new guard. Paladar threatened Ked with a beating if Guff's replacement also proved incompetent.
It is unclear if Ked was a guard, or if they were just in charge of their organization.
