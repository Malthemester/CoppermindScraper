## Appearance
Stormshelters are constructed out of durable materials, such as stone or bricks. Some are built, while others are [[Soulcasting\|Soulcast]]. They are designed to give the storm as little purchase as possible, with rounded, low roofs, making them look like loaves of bread. While they're made to be secure, at least some of them are built with windows.

## Usage
The primary purpose of a stormshelter is to protect the people and livestock inside from a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] -- and, later, the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. Though most people hide in their homes, the government maintains a number of public stormshelters available to the travelers and the homeless, although they have limited capacity. Moreover, the stormshelters are of paramount importance in warfare. Armies on the move are housed in them, and any force planning a siege will focus on constructing them as fast as possible. During battle, civilians hide in them while soldiers fight.
Apart from that, stormshelters are a place of social interaction. Some storm bunkers are built specifically for rich people who come there to enjoy themselves and mingle during highstorms, with many becoming popular hangout spots. For the people of lower classes, the stormshelter can serve as a public meeting spot or a dance hall.

## Trivia
The name "stormshelter" was first used to describe those buildings in *Oathbringer*; until then, they were only known as "storm bunkers".
