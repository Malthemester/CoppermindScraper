The **Deepest Ones** are unknown beings in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].
It is unknown if the Deepest Ones actually exist or are just a myth, but Silence fears them. If her fears are any indication, they seem to be drawn by fighting, perhaps specifically fighting between [[Shade\|shades]] and humans, and seem to be far more dangerous than even a large number of shades.
They will be heavily involved in the Threnody novel.
