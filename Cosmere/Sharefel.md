>“*I will not lift the Blade against other listeners.*”
\-Sharefel[1]


**Sharefel** is a [[Listener\|listener]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is an older malen with mostly black skin.
When Sharefel's listener family conquered one of the eight proper listener cities of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], the defeated family relinquished the city's [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] to Sharefel's possession. On the day that [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] and several others first successfully adopted [[Warform\|warform]], they went to speak with him immediately afterwards, as one of the other listener families had come to try to win the city. Sharefel was astonished at their accomplishment and asked how they had done it; after proclaiming that he would do the same on the next [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], he asked which of the new warforms would take his Shards. [[Melu\|Melu]] was the most eager to take them, but as [[Thude\|Thude]] held her back, Eshonai realized that a fight might break out over the choice. She instead asked Sharefel to wear the Plate out when they went to speak to the attackers. He agreed, although he insisted that he would not attack them.
It is unknown what his fate ended up being, although, as Eshonai bore the Shards during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], it seems likely that he died around that time.
