**Wax's earring** is a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgically]] charged [[Pathism\|Pathian]] earring, created from the melted-down spikes of a [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitor]]. It was given to him by the [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]]. It is small and simple, with a head stamped with ten interlocking rings, the symbol of the Path.
It allows [[Harmony\|Harmony]] to communicate with Wax, speaking through [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and hearing Wax's thoughts through [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. Although the earring is a Hemalurgic spike, it has very little charge and grants practically no abilities.

## History
MeLaan personally delivered the earring to Wax many years before his return to [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. He wore it frequently, especially when praying or doing something important, and often touched it while thinking things over. He began to wear it less after finding out it was a Hemalurgic spike and becoming angry at Harmony for letting [[Lessie\|Lessie]] die.
In order to take down [[Paalm\|Paalm]], Wax asked [[Ranette\|Ranette]] to reforge the earring into a bullet. He shot Paalm with it, delivering a second Hemalurgic spike into her body and allowing Harmony to start taking control of her, though she committed suicide to avoid falling under his control again.
After that, Harmony and the kandra attempted to deliver him a new earring, but he refused to begin wearing one again.
