For the field commander under [[Adolin\|Adolin]] during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], see [[Perel\|Perel]].
**Vedekar Perel** is a [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] [[Alethi\|Alethi]] officer in the [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]] army on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He moves to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and is murdered by [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]].

## Appearance and Personality
He has bulbous features. His build is similar to that of [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], who is described as "stout".
He is quiet and well-liked. Although he is in the military, he is known as an administrator and not a soldier. He is not a particularly prominent member of the Sebarial army, as he is not known to either [[Shallan\|Shallan]] or [[Adolin\|Adolin]] before he is murdered.

## History
Perel presumably lived at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], as he was present in Urithiru shortly after the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] at [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]] was activated.
Not long after the move to Urithiru, his body was discovered by a scouting party that included several members of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]]. He was found in a bathing chamber in a remote part of the second level of Urithiru, close to where the corpse of Torol Sadeas had been found a few days earlier. Perel's corpse was found with a bloodied face, positioned in the exact same way that Sadeas was found. He was stabbed through the eye, also paralleling Sadeas, and his clothing was disheveled and showed signs of a struggle. Several people (including [[Navani\|Navani]] and Shallan) assumed that the same person killed both men.
In the absence of [[Niter\|Niter]] and [[Malan\|Malan]], [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] assigned Adolin to oversee the investigation of the murders. Adolin enlisted [[May Aladar\|May Aladar]] and others to interview Perel's family and friends, but was unable to find any connection between the two victims. After a series of other copycat murders, Shallan reviewed her sketches and came to the realization that a twisted spren killed Perel because of his physical resemblance to Sadeas; this led to a confrontation between Shallan and the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] known as [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] after Shallan realized that Re-Shephir had been trying to gain a better understanding of human behavior by mimicking their violence.
