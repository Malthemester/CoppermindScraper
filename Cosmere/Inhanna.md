**Inhanna** is the high priestess of the [[Returned\|Returned]] known as [[Blushweaver\|Blushweaver]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].

## History
At some point after joining Blushweaver's service, Inhanna approached her to ask if she wanted the storage tunnels under her palace connected to the main system of tunnels; Blushweaver declined, as she didn't want to have to put up with the digging noises.
During the events of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]], Inhanna argued with [[Nanrovah\|Nanrovah]] in the Court Assembly because she was in favor of war between [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] and [[Idris\|Idris]]. She considered Idris to be a rebel enclave and resented the fact that they controlled the northern passes for trading as well as all of the workable copper mines. Inhanna was also concerned by the Idrians' continued claim that their king was the rightful ruler of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] and the fact that Idrian armies were so close to Hallandren.
