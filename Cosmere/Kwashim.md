**Kwashim** is a [[Terris\|Terris]] girl from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. She was a teenage student in [[The Village\|The Village]] at the same time as [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is dark-skinned and slender. She is rebellious and does not seem to take her studies seriously. She has gone into the city many times to drink.

## History
Around the year 314 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Kwashim, [[Forch\|Forch]], and [[Idashwy\|Idashwy]] shirked a meditation assignment and waited in the forest for Telsin, intending to sneak out of The Village and go drinking in a different part of [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. Wax followed Telsin into the forest, and Kwashim was disappointed to see him. She thought of Wax as a teacher's pet, and she was worried that he would give them away. The group spied on the [[Synod\|Synod]], and Kwashim seemed to delight in Wax's nervousness. When the group confirmed that [[Vwafendal\|Vwafendal]] was preoccupied with an emergency, Kwashim thought that it would be easy to sneak out of the [[Elendel\|Tin Gate]]. Kwashim left with Forch and Telsin, but Wax did not join them; he returned to see what was happening with Vwafendal.
