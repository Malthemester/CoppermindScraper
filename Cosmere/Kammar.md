**Kammar** is an ancient fighting stance developed on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Kammar is designed to defeat enemies without harming them, and so is considered a peaceful form. It focuses on grabbing people and immobilizing them by using their own weight against them. Only the hands are used in kammar.
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] is trained in kammar, so it is possible that this is a [[Shin\|Shin]]-specific art. The grabbing motions are ideal for [[Surgebinding\|infusing]] people with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], so Szeth is dangerous even with it alone, and without a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
