**Twist** is a [[Taynix\|taynix]] that [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] discovers in a cavern on [[Detritus\|Detritus]] along with several other taynix. FM thinks of Twist as being female. Twist is of the yellow and blue variety of taynix, meaning she can use her [[Cytonics\|Cytonic]] abilities to teleport. Twist likes to roll over to get her belly scratched, which leads to [[Rodge McCaffery\|Rig]] giving her her name.
Twist goes with [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] on their rescue mission to [[Sunreach (station)\|Sunreach]]. With Jorgen’s direction, Twist uses her cytonic abilities to teleport into [[T-Stall\|T-Stall]]’s starfighter and bring him into the station, saving him.
