## Appearance and History
 by  Esther Schrader 
For more images, see [[Chanarach/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Though Chana is likely of similar age to other [[Herald\|Heralds]], Vorin artwork tends to present her as a young woman. She was born on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]], and left it for [[Roshar\|Roshar]] when the planet was struck by a catastrophe.
When humans and [[Singer\|singers]] went to war, she and nine other people were made Heralds by [[Honor\|Honor]]. Following every [[Desolation\|Desolation]], she would travel to [[Braize\|Braize]] and be tortured there until either she or one of the other Heralds broke, sending them back to Roshar and starting a new Desolation.
At [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], Chanarach, like the rest, abandoned the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], leaving her [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] at the location of the final battle and departing for parts unknown. What happened to her afterwards is unknown, though she is still alive.

## Abilities

For the abilities all Heralds share, see Herald#Abilities.
As a [[Herald\|Herald]], Chanaranach is immortal and capable of returning from death, though at the cost of a Desolation. She was a capable fighter, and wielded an [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] that made her a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]], granting her the use of the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Division\|Division]] and [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]]. She has discarded her Blade, however, leaving her without Surgebinding.
Perhaps due to her power over Abrasion, Chanaranch is known for being incredibly fast, as [[Fleet\|Fleet]] beating her in a foot race is considered a noteworthy achievement.

## Culture
 by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]]
In [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], Chanarach is known under the symmetrical name **Chanaranach**, though the diminutive Chana is also used. **Chan-a-rach** is a far rarer spelling, only seen used in a song. She is associated with the number 3 (chach), the [[Ten Essences\|Essence]] Spark, and the divine attributes of Brave and Obedient. Her body focus is the soul. Phrases such as "Chana knows..." and "Chana help (somebody)" are common, and typically related to threat or protectiveness. The name [[Chanada\|Chanada]] is likely derived from Chana.
As with the other Heralds, there is a temple to her in every modern city. This tradition appears to go back to the [[Desolation\|Desolations]], as there was once a temple of Chanaranach in [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]].

## Trivia
Chanarach's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the Guard by the [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] staff.
It is possible that [[Liss\|Liss]], the assassin, is Chanarach.
