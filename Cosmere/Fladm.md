**Fladm** is a guard at the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]] in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
In early 1174, he was part of a guard rotation stationed at the door to the queen's personal sphere vault within the inner vault of the Gemstone Reserve. [[Rysn\|Rysn]] was familiar with Fladm since she often entered the vault to perform her accounting duties. He was on duty during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] when Rysn and [[Vstim\|Vstim]] entered the queen's vault to work on an audit, accompanied by another vault guard named [[Tlik\|Tlik]] and a member of the Queen's Guard. Fladm waited near the entrance to the vault.
The Queen's Guardsman revealed himself to be a [[Fused\|Fused]] in disguise; he murdered Tlik, took his crossbow, and stole the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]] ruby. Fladm was the first guard to hear the commotion, and quickly arrived in the vault while raising the alarm. He shot the infiltrator in the back twice, but the Fused seemed to heal himself. The thief then shot Fladm with Tlik's crossbow, and Rysn encountered Fladm's corpse a short time later. Rysn took Fladm's crossbow and used it to avenge him and the other guards by shooting the Fused through the chin while [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri]] prevented him from healing.
Fladm's body was presumably lost in the rubble of the Reserve after [[Yushah\|Yushah]] destroyed it during her search for the King's Drop.
