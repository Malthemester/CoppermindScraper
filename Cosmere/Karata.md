**Karata** was an [[Arelene\|Arelene]] [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] from [[Sel\|Sel]].

## Appearance and Personality
She led one of the gangs in the [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] prior to [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] arrival. She lived in the Elantrian palace, where she sheltered the children who had been taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]].
She personally approached each new Elantrian arrival that entered her territory first, taking their offering but rarely if ever harming them.

## History
Karata had lived in [[Kae\|Kae]] with her husband, who was a Royal Guard, and had a little daughter, [[Opais\|Opais]], before she was taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. She first met her husband while serving as a nurse for a group of mercenaries. Upon being thrown into Elantris she became one of the three gang leaders within the city. She took over the former palace, her territory bordering closely to that of [[Aanden\|Aanden]]. The food of anyone thrown into Elantris who took their first step forward instead of left or right was considered the property of her gang. She would personally go to the gate and take the food from them, trying not to use force unless it was necessary unlike [[Shaor\|Shaor]] and Aanden's men.
When [[Raoden\|Raoden]] was cast into the city he learnt that she had escaped Elantris three times in the past and had been caught trying to break into the palace of Kae, causing rumours she wanted to assassinate King [[Iadon\|Iadon]]. When Raoden began to form [[New Elantris\|New Elantris]] it was closest to Karata's territory and she sent her ment to attack them, destroy what they had built and steal their food, thinking he was trying to start a rival gang. Raoden asked her to call off her men if he snuck her out of Elantris and got her into the palace. She agreed and they escaped via a well. When outside the palace he asked her not to hurt Iadon, causing her to realise he was Prince Raoden. She revealed she didn't want to kill Iadon, she only wanted to see her child. Once inside Karata was able to spend time with her child before her husband, whilst on patrol, spotted them. He didn't recognise Karata due to the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] altering her appearance and he attacked her, although Raoden tricked him into believing they cast a spell on him which would kill him if he moved. With Karata's husband terrified of moving they were able to get away and Karata thanked Raoden for resolving the matter without killing her husband.
Karata then took Raoden to the palace within Elantris and showed him a room. In the room, Raoden found that Karata had been taking all the children thrown into Elantris and giving them a safe place to play and enough food to eat.
Karata became one of Raoden's closest companions and allies within Elantris, watching closely over New Elantris and warning him about the movements and actions being taken by and against the other gang leaders, [[Aanden\|Aanden]] and [[Shaor\|Shaor]].
She also took Raoden to the structure with the secret library beneath it that led to the pool that dissolved Elantrian bodies.
During the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]], Derethi soldiers and [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]] monks attacked New Elantris. Only Karata and [[Galladon\|Galladon]] escaped. They went into Kae, looking for Raoden and found he had already been [[Hoed\|Hoed]]. Karata and the distraught Galladon agreed to take Raoden, dissolve him in the pool and then dissolve themselves too. However, when they placed Raoden in the pool he got back up and began to charge down the hill.
Frantic, Raoden was drawing the [[Chasm\|Chasm]] into the base Aon in [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] when Fjordell soldiers tried to stop him. Karata and Galladon where uncertain what he was trying to do but agreed that they couldn't let the Fjordell soldiers stop him so attacked the soldiers. In the fighting Karata was beheaded, one of the few ways to permanently kill an Elantrian. A few seconds later Raoden completed the Aon, restoring the Elantrians to full power.
She is buried in beside [[Eondel\|Eondel]], [[Roial\|Roial]] and [[Saolin\|Saolin]] in one of the graves dedicated to those who had fought for Arelon
