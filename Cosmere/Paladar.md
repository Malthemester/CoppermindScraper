## Appearance and Personality
Paladar is tall and bald. He is lighteyed, and his title as highlord implies that he is of the third [[Dahn\|dahn]]. He is known to be greedy, corrupt, and notoriously harsh.

## History
### Regent of Vamah Princedom
Paladar held power over Vamah princedom as regent both during and immediately following the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], while Highprince Vamah was in the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. He lived in [[Revolar\|Revolar]], the largest city and seat of power in Vamah princedom.
Revolar suffered under his leadership due to his greed. Many [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] who attempted to travel to the city were driven away, despite holding the [[Right of travel\|right of travel]]. [[Moash\|Moash]], who hailed from [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], frequently visited Revolar with caravans and noted that Paladar's corrupt policies were well-known.

### True Desolation
Paladar was among the human population that was enslaved after the [[Singers\|singers]] captured Revolar in early 1174. However, Paladar was able to exert influence over his fellow captives and set himself up as a leader, avoiding labor while hoarding food and resources for himself and other favored lighteyes. He was particularly interested in recruiting soldiers from amongst the captives, and he also held sway over a number of darkeyed guards and merchants. Caravaneers captured by the singers also worked under Paladar's directives, despite their past dislike for him. Paladar's goal was to restore his place within the city, and he seemed to hold out hope that the Alethi armies would recapture Revolar.
Old [[Guff\|Guff]] brought Moash to Paladar per a standing order to find soldiers; however, when Moash appeared to exhibit mental problems, Paladar told [[Ked\|Ked]] to have Guff beaten for incompetence.

## Trivia
Paladar's specific familial relationship to Vamah is unclear, but he is likely also related to Vamah's cousin, [[Kalanor\|Kalanor]].
