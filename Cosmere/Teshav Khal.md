## History
Teshav is married to [[General Khal\|General Khal]], one of Dalinar's officers. Dalinar often utilizes her skill as a scribe and attendant. She often relays reports from [[Adolin\|Adolin]] about how his tasks are going, such as the investigation into [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] girth strap.
Teshav also investigates things herself on Dalinar's orders, such as the actions of other highprinces, banditry statistics, or the king's accounts. She will also draft missives and notices on Dalinar's orders.
Dalinar has Teshav read various histories, seemingly so she can better understand the needs of the [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].
Teshav is also present as an advisor during Dalinar's first attempt to contact the other monarchs to unify [[Roshar\|Roshar]] against the [[Voidbringers\|voidbringers]].
She was present in the command post at the top of the city during the battle of Thaylen City, and afterwards makes Shallan tea. Shallan notes that the tea is bitter and likely has something in it to keep Teshav on her feet, noting scribes always know the best tea for those type of purposes.
