## Geography
Alm is a small nation bordered by [[Yezier\|Yezier]] and [[Liafor\|Liafor]]. It is also adjacent to [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], although the two nations are separated by the [[Misted Mountains\|Misted Mountains]]. Most of Alm's territory lies between a large river and the mountains. It also has a small coastline on a bay connected to the [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]].

## Culture
As a member of the Azish Empire, Alm is self-governing, but recognizes the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] as their emperor and generally follows Azir's lead in international politics.
Since Alm's population is ethnically Makabaki, its people generally have dark skin and hair, and the local language is presumably a variant of Azish. Alm and the nearby nation of [[Desh\|Desh]] are considered to be more rural than other Azish nations, and local fashion consists of clothing that is lighter than that of their neighbors.

## History
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Alm was part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. During the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], it joined other Makabaki nations to form the Azish Empire.
At some point after the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] and the subsequent [[Scouring of Aimia\|Scouring of Aimia]], Alm experienced an influx of refugees from Aimia, although it is not certain when exactly this occurred and at what rate. It is also unclear how many refugees immigrated to Alm and what impact this might have had on the local culture and population.
[[Lift\|Lift]] once visited Alm and enjoyed her time there, since relatively few people tried to kill her.
Due to their location on the western edge of Roshar, [[Steen\|Steen]] and Alm were the first nations to report the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], which worried [[Ghenna\|Ghenna]] and the government of [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]].
Both Alm and Desh had ambassadors in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] when [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] agreed to visit [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
