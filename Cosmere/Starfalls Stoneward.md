## Appearance and Personality
The Stoneward has light tan skin, similar to that of a modern [[Alethi\|Alethi]]. She has light tan eyes that seem to glow, and wears her hair in a bun. She wears "delicate" [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] that glows with an amber light, and is able to summon and dismiss the helm. She is very calm and focused in dangerous situations. When Dalinar asks her questions about who she fights for, she emphasizes her duty to protect the world by training in the arts of war.

## Attributes and Abilities
For more information, see [[Order of Stonewards\|Order of Stonewards]].
The Stoneward exhibits the typical abilities of the ancient [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], including a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] that she is able to summon or dismiss at will. Although Dalinar does not observe her using Stoneward abilities, the amber color of her armor places her in that Order. She is a skilled fighter and was able to fend off an attack by the [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] with the help of Dalinar and her [[Starfalls Windrunner\|Windrunner companion]].
She also is in possession of a healing [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] that consists of a large [[Topaz\|topaz]] and a large [[Heliodor\|heliodor]] entwined in a metal cage. By using the fabrial and touching someone, she is able to heal serious wounds almost instantly. She makes reference to the fabrial's use of [[Regrowth\|Regrowth]].

## History
She and a Windrunner companion rescued Dalinar's embodiment [[Heb\|Heb]] and his family from an attack by the [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] in their village. She appeared suddenly during the attack and used a fabrial to heal both "Heb" and his wife [[Taffa\|Taffa]] after they were injured defending themselves. She then summoned her Shardblade and joined her companion to defeat the monsters. She was shocked when Dalinar joined the fight skillfully wielding a fireplace poker, but the three of them quickly formed a defensive position; after a difficult battle, they destroyed all of the creatures.
The Windrunner flew away, leaving the Stoneward to guard the family, and Dalinar used the opportunity to ask her a few questions. She was a bit confused by the nature of his questions, but explained that they were in [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]] during the Eighth Epoch. She explained that the attacking creatures were not [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]], but rather the Midnight Essence (which she called one of the [[Ten Deaths\|Ten Deaths]]), although she did not know who had released it.
She also briefly discussed the Knights Radiant; at that time, the Orders were centered in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] but the Knights lived in [[Alethela\|Alethela]]. She emphasized that it was the duty of the Knights to train in the art of war and stay vigilant for the [[Desolation\|Desolations]], and that they gave their lives to keep the world safe. She urged Dalinar to come train with the Radiants, since they had could teach people how to manage the burden that came along with fighting and killing. She mentioned that [[Harkaylain\|Harkaylain]] had predicted that a Desolation would be coming soon before quickly departing when she heard screaming nearby.

>‚Äú*Every pasture needs three things. Flocks to grow, herdsmen to tend, and watchers at the rim. We of Alethela are those watchers‚Äîthe warriors who protect and fight. We maintain the terrible arts of killing, then pass them on to others when the Desolation comes*‚Äù
