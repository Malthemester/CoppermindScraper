**Peacegiver's Treasure**, also called the **Treasure of Peacegiver** and the **Light of Peace**, is a store of over fifty thousand [[Breath\|Breaths]] that the [[Returned\|Returned]] [[Peacegiver\|Peacegiver the Blessed]] left to the [[God King\|God Kings]] of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].
The priesthood now believes that Peacegiver died when giving them the Breath, but that he may one day Return again to reclaim it. He gave the priests a commission: to protect the Breath, and never to use it. For this purpose, the priests created the succession of the God Kings--whenever an infant Returns, the priests believe this is a sign to change God Kings. They find a wife for the God King, preferring to use the child he fathers if possible; they take the child and cut out his tongue, then pass on the treasure of Breaths to the child, making him God King. However, if old God King fails to produce an heir, the stillborn infant [[Returned\|Returned]] would be used as a backup plan.
The vast store of Breaths raises the God King to the Tenth [[Heightening\|Heightening]], which is the secret to the old God King's ability to pass on his Breaths despite his missing tongue: at this Heightening, one can learn to give Commands mentally. This system essentially turns the God Kings into storehouses in order to fulfill the task left by Peacegiver. In addition, the priests provide each God King with two or more Breaths per week, steadily adding to the amount of Breath Peacegiver's Treasure actually contains.
