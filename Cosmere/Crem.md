## Appearance and Properties
Crem is a light brown, sediment-like substance. It falls along with the heavy rains during [[Highstorm\|highstorms]], while the lighter rainfall during the [[Weeping\|Weepings]] does not carry it. It gives stormwater a metallic taste. Consuming it can cause sickness, making highstorm water unsafe to drink; however, after about a day, it will settle on the bottom of the container, leaving clean water above. When dried, it can turn into dust. Water mixed with crem is known as **cremwater**. **Cremslime** - a thicker mud formed of water mixed with crem - has an unpleasant stench. Densely-packed, accumulated crem forms **cremstone**, which is tannish brown in color.
Highstorms cause crem buildup on all structures, whether unnatural or natural, such as buildings, plateaus, and even corpses. Unless cleaned regularly, everything on Roshar eventually becomes covered with crem, and any overhangs will grow crem stalactites. In fact, the entire continent is slowly "migrating" leeward, thanks to the highstorms depositing crem as they travel.
Despite being above the storms, even [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] has some crem built up on the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] platforms. This is because the height of highstorm varies periodically, sometimes being higher than Urithiru.
Crem is currently influenced by [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], despite predating her.

## Applications
### Ecology
Crem is utilized by native [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] flora as source of nutrients, as well as structural reinforcement. [[Jella\|Jella]] trees absorb crem to strengthen their wood against [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. [[Shalebark\|Shalebark]] feeds on crem, and [[Lavis\|lavis]] polyps grow from seed-crem (which can be presumed to be crem mixed with lavis seeds).
Rosharan fauna derive the minerals used to grow [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] from drinking crem-infused water.

### Human uses
Crem is one of [[Roshar\|Roshar's]] most versatile materials. Historically, humans have used it in construction, in the form of bricks. **Crembrick** buildings can be found even in the present day, and some cities, such as [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], have walls plastered with crem for insulation. [[Singer\|Singers]], too, utilize crem and stone as building materials.
To filter crem out of rainwater, the people of Roshar use storm cisterns, which can do so automatically. The crem filtered out of water is often used as clay. Among others, the people of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]] are renowned for their expert crem pottery.
Crem is also utilized in farming. When growing [[Lavis\|lavis]], crem is added as fertilizer. It's also used when deworming fields to close the holes after removing worms, so that no new pests can infest the field again.
In scholarship, crem can be used for geological and archaeological dating, by measuring the strata and the crem buildup. However, this isn't practical in areas that experience strong winds, as crem pools unevenly there.

## In culture
Crem is a go-to derogatory term for most Rosharans, and features in a number of insults, such as "cremstained", "crem-crusted" or "the crem of something". The small crustaceans of Roshar are collectively called [[Cremling\|cremlings]]; this, too, is used as an insult. This being said, while it is generally considered a nuisance, [[Rysn\|Rysn]] finds crem superior to [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] soil, if only slightly.
One of Roshar's "where babies come from" myths claims that they are crafted from crem clay.

## Trivia
The word "crem" is a transliteration, rather than translation, of the Rosharan word for it.
