The **Broadsider Faction** is one of the six pirate factions in the [[Belt\|belt]] of the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]]. They are a somewhat ragtag group, with under twenty members and nine starfighters. They stole their ships from the Superiority. They are split up into flights, including [[Cutlass Flight\|Cutlass Flight]] and .
The Broadsider territory is a wedge of the belt tapering inward, bordered by other pirate factions on either side. Their territory ends at the Superiority-controlled area. Their territory shares a border with the Cannonade Faction, with the Broadsider base being fairly close to the border. Their territory is home to two portals that are steps on the [[Path of Elders\|Path of Elders]]. The Broadsiders have thoroughly searched the ruins surrounding the portal for salvage, but aren’t aware of the portal’s significance.

## Assets
The Broadsiders have a miss-matched assortment of spacecraft, including at least two modified civilian ships, at least two purposefully made combat fighters, and a heavily armored shuttle. They soend a large amount of time maintaining their ships, figuring out how to make replacement part out of salvage material. They have a long range scanner, a rare find. It allows them to spot enemy craft entering its radius and give them advance warning. They use nonlethal destructors like the other groups in the nowhere, so their destructors will cause the enemy ship to power down and lock up.
