>“*The Shards are not God, but they are pieces of God. Ruin, Preservation, Autonomy, Cultivation, Devotion...There are sixteen of them.*”
\-Khriss[1]


The **Shards of Adonalsium**, or **Shards** for short, are sixteen pieces of the power of creation. They are each named after a specific characteristic or ideal that represents the Shard's primary purpose or motivation. A person who has taken up the power of a Shard is the **Vessel** of that Shard.
The Shards are the most powerful known entities in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], and for all intents and purposes, serve as the gods of the cosmere. Most if not all magic systems are related to them.

### Power
Each Shard is a piece of the power of creation with a specific motivation, such as to destroy or to preserve. Those fragments each began their existence with equal level of power; however, over time many have diminished, whether through conflict or by the act of Investing a world -- imbuing it with [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Each Shard has its own Investiture; while a Shard can co-opt the Investiture of another Shard, that Investiture can become noticeably red.
Investing in a world will produce numerous effects, most notably the creation of a magic system tied to the Shard. While a Shard doesn't have complete control over how the magic system functions or what it does, it can manipulate its mechanics to an extent. Moreover, the presence of a Shard leads to the formation of a [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]], a well of the Shard's Investiture that pierces all three [[Realmatic Theory\|Realms]], allowing for [[Worldhopping\|worldhopping]]. The Shard's Investiture can also manifest directly in the world in other ways; examples of such manifestations are [[Atium\|atium]] and [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], or the many [[Spren\|spren]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

### Vessel
To function properly, a Shard requires a **Vessel** -- a mind to control it, belonging to a sapient creature from the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], such as a human. Currently, there is only one Shard held by a Dragon ([[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]). One doesn't need to be able to use Investiture in order to become a Vessel, but the ability does help. What becoming a Vessel requires above all is [[Connection\|Connection]] to the Shard in question, whether forged artificially or driven by a natural inclination towards the Shard's intent. Upon Ascension, a Vessel loses its connection to its former species -- for example, a human who Ascended is no longer considered human. However, it is possible for Vessels to reproduce.
The act of becoming a Vessel is called **Ascension**, and causes the Vessel's body to vaporize and mind to expand. From then on, the Vessel and the Shard are intertwined; the Vessel gets to set some general course of how the Shard's power is defined, and feeds off the Shard's power to remain alive, but the Shard's power is the driving force between the two. Over centuries, the Vessel's mind begins to change to fit the Shard's intent more perfectly. If a Vessel fights against their Shards intent, they can be left vulnerable. If the Vessel were to give up the Shard, the Shard's influence on their mind would fade over time.
A Shard can be killed by Splintering it, breaking its power down further into smaller pieces, called [[Splinter\|splinters]]; the easiest way to achieve that is by killing the mind. The actual death of a Vessel, however, can take up to hundreds of years. If the Shard is taken up before the Vessel dies completely, splintering can be prevented; if not, the power will become wild and dangerous. A Shard without a Vessel will eventually gain sentience. When a Vessel dies, the person's original body materializes and falls to the ground as a corpse. However, it does not age rapidly, since Shardic immortality is different from other methods like atium compounding.
It is possible for Vessels to be separated from their Shards without dying or Splintering the Shards they held. If this happens, then after the Vessel's death, it is able to resist the pull into the [[Beyond\|Beyond]].
A mentally ill Vessel can affect the Shard's intent.

## History

>“*I have delved and searched, and have only been able to come up with a single name: Adonalsium. Who, or what, it was, I do not yet know.*”
\-Sazed[28]


It is unknown what precisely [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] was, though it has been referred to numerous times as the power of creation, suggesting it to be the progenitor god of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. At some point in the distant past, on the planet of [[Yolen\|Yolen]], sixteen people conspired to kill it, and succeeded in an event known as the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]]. Some of those people were romantically involved; others were related to each other. All of them were mortal at some point.
Following the Shattering, the power that comprised Adonalsium broke into sixteen pieces, each polarized to one particular aspect of it, such as [[Ruin\|Ruin]] or [[Endowment\|Endowment]]. Those pieces, each equal in power, became known as the Shards. The sixteen killers of Adonalsium each took up one of the Shards, Ascending and becoming the first Vessels. Following their Ascension, each of the Vessels departed Yolen. Some settled on various planets, henceforth dubbed [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]]; others set no roots. At this time they all had an equal amount of power.
Originally, the Shards made an agreement not to interfere with each other, but they did not make a formal oath and many of the Shards chose not to keep to the agreement. Additionally, [[Honor\|Honor]] felt he did not break the agreement by traveling with [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], suggesting the wording of the agreement may not have been as precise as Shards like Endowment thought.
Over the millennia, several Shards have passed away, one way or another. The most common cause of death for them were actions of one specific Shard, [[Odium\|Odium]], who went on a killing spree, splintering [[Ambition\|Ambition]], [[Devotion\|Devotion]], [[Dominion\|Dominion]] and [[Honor\|Honor]] before eventually being trapped in the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]] by the remnants of the latter. The death of [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] Vessel, [[Leras\|Leras]], led to the power being passed between several hands before it was eventually combined with [[Ruin\|Ruin]] to form [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. By contrast, [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] spread, creating avatars to inhabit numerous Shardworlds, including [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]] and [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]].
At least one of the Vessels regrets taking up a Shard, though which one that would be is unknown. There are living descendants of some of them still alive. At least one Shard other than Odium has been forced to leave their Shardworld after its destruction.

## Known Shards
There are sixteen original Shards, with fifteen Shards (including Harmony) currently known. Two of the original Shards are currently unknown.
While most [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]] have only one Shard, [[Sel\|Sel]] and [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] are both dishardic, hosting two Shards each. [[Roshar\|Roshar]], on the other hand, is the only known example of a world influenced by three Shards.

### Hybrid Shards
Several of the known Shards are dead in the current time, with [[Ambition\|Ambition]], [[Honor\|Honor]], [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]] all being [[Splinter\|splintered]], with the remnants of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]] having been combined together in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] as [[The Dor\|the Dor]]. [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]], on the other hand, have blended together into [[Harmony\|Harmony]], albeit they remain somewhat separate within this unified construct.

### Unnamed Shards
>“*Some men, as they age, grow wiser. I am not one of those, for wisdom and I have always been at cross-purposes, and I have yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks.*”
\-Hoid possibly implying the existence of another Shard[69][70]


There remain two Shards that have not been named, nor referred to explicitly in text.
One of these two Shards has an intent similar to Wisdom or Prudence. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] and this Shard may be antagonistic towards each other, though this appears to be something of a common thread in his relations with the original Vessels. There is a Shard that "[[Survival Shard\|just wants to hide and survive]]," though it has realized over time that that may not be the most desirable course of action; this may be the "wisdom" Shard.
At one point, there was an unknown Shard that does not inhabit a planet. Since then, however, the Shards [[Ambition\|Ambition]], [[Invention\|Invention]], [[Mercy\|Mercy]], [[Valor\|Valor]], and [[Whimsy\|Whimsy]] have been revealed; it is unclear if any of them are this Shard. Similarly, at one point there was at least one unknown Shard that had been Splintered by Odium, though the Splintered Shard Ambition has been revealed since then.
In addition to these unknown Shards, Harmony believes there are Shards that are hidden to him that are encroaching on Scadrial. This likely refers to the entity [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trell]], which is associated with one of the nine Shards that were known when [[Trellium\|trellium]] first appeared, possibly Autonomy.

## Powers and Abilities
>“*The power of ancient Adonalsium permeates him. And controls him. Odium is a force like pressure, gravitation, or the movement of time. These things cannot break their own rules. Nor can he.*”
\-Stormfather[82]


Shards possess incredible power -- a single Shard can easily move entire planets and alter people down to the genetic level. They exist in all three Realms, but unlike other living beings, the vast majority of their power is concentrated in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] and [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]]. Shards do not appear in the Cognitive Realm like other entities (such as a bead on Roshar). Time matters little to Shards, and they can bend and stretch it as they wish.
As [[Investiture\|Investiture]] never truly goes away, a Shard has access to a functionally-endless supply of it; however, there is a finite amount that a Vessel can command at any one time. This means that while all Investiture in the cosmere is assigned to one Shard or another, a Shard cannot truly command all of it at once. As such, while powerful, Shards are not omniscient, omnipresent, nor omnipotent.
A Shard's power can be temporarily diminished, either by assigning it to living creatures (such as people or [[Spren\|spren]]), or sending it back to the Spiritual Realm (e.g. burning [[Atium\|atium]]). Moreover, Shards are, as powers, bound to follow higher rules; a deal, once made by a Shard, cannot be broken, and they must absolutely obey the rules that govern them. Breaking such deals will leave holes in them that another Shard can exploit to kill them.
Each Shard appears particularly predisposed toward acting in line with their intent; for example, [[Preservation\|Preservation]] finds it nearly impossible to destroy, while it's extremely easy for [[Ruin\|Ruin]] to do so. This is partially influenced by the personality change brought about by the Shard. However, whether intentions provide Shards with actual unique powers is unknown.

### Individual Powers

Shards are capable of appearing in various parts of their own Invested worlds instantaneously. They can also travel to other planets by willing themselves to do so. However, when a Shard Invests its power in a world, it's bound to it and will have difficulty leaving the system it is in. Shards can also trap each other in systems, though the precise mechanics of that are unknown.


Shards have several ways of communicating with people. Some Shards can speak directly into the minds of others, while others can listen. A Shard can also communicate with a person directly through dreams or visions, and even take on a physical form -- a puppet of sorts, serving as a Physical outlet for communication. While the use of visions and speaking directly into a mind are limited to a single person, a puppet can be seen by many people.
A Shard can also communicate directly with [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]].


Upon Ascension, the [[Vessel\|Vessel's]] mind will be greatly expanded, allowing a far greater capacity to think than a mortal could. A Shard is capable of bilocation -- being present in several places at once -- within its sphere of influence. As moments can pass like years to a Shard, they can also appear to think far faster than normal minds. Fundamental understanding of the cosmere, to the point of [[Axi\|axi]] and anti-axi, also comes as a result. They seem to possess flawless memory, with no obvious upper limit, as [[Sazed\|Sazed]] is able to absorb the tremendous amount of knowledge in his [[Metalmind\|metalminds]].
However, contrary to what many believes, Shards are neither omniscient nor omnipresent. They can only appear at limited places at once, and can be distracted, deceived or surprised. It is also possible to block a Shard's senses away from a certain area. They are incapable of breaking a formal contract, at least not without seriously wounding themselves.


Shards can use their power to create complex **constructs**, capable of continuing their function past the Shard's death. Examples of such constructs are the snapping mists of [[Preservation\|Preservation]], and the vision journal of [[Honor\|Honor]]. Shards can also create sapient beings from their power -- this is most commonly seen on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], with its overabundance of [[Spren\|spren]]. Many of them, like the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]], [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]], and [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] were created by local Shards.
Shards can also create **avatars**, personas that can act independently of them. Avatars can be of any gender, race, and species, regardless of the original Vessel creating them, and can be formed at a considerable distance from the main body of the Shard, with many different avatars able to exist on a single [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]]. Though a Shard can create them directly, avatars can also form without a conscious decision on the Shard's part, though the Shard is still aware of what is happening. When created directly, however, they can be instilled with specific traits. Some avatars are self-aware, while others are not, although the parent Shard will always be aware. Though some would call these avatars Splinters, it is not clear whether they truly fit the definition.
Avatars are, in a way, considered to be Shards in their own right. Known ones include [[Patji (being)\|Patji]] and the [[Sand Lord\|Sand Lord]], both of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]]. It is difficult but possible for someone to become a Vessel of an avatar.
Shardic power is also directly related to sentience and sapience. The close presence of a particular Shard, such as [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], can lead to some beings developing higher levels of sapience. Shardic power can also grant sentience directly -- [[Scadrian\|Scadrians]] are sapient due to Preservation's power within them, and [[Nightblood\|Nightblood's]] sapience is partially derived from his large quantity of [[Breath\|Breaths]]. [[Splinter\|Splinters]] can also become sapient. Even the raw power of a Shard, if left alone and without a Vessel, will eventually begin to form a rudimentary mind.


When a Shard Invests a world, it will begin to fuel the local magic system. Each Shard can do this differently, though much of the system is dictated by the planet itself. Because of this connection to the magic, a Shard is able to directly interact with its users and provide Investiture when necessary, without the need for intermediaries.
While not all magic systems in the cosmere are directly tied to a Shard, Shardic presence greatly influences the shape a magic system takes. On a [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]], magic forms as a result of the interactions between a Shard's power, [[Realmatic\|Realmatics]], the world's natural inclinations and, in some cases, even genetics. For this reason, the exact function magic performs will not always be related to the Shard's nature -- for example, [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], despite being powered by [[Honor\|Honor]], is capable of manipulating [[Division\|Division]], which controls separating things. However, how the magic is *obtained* is tied to the Shard. [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] demands that a person be destroyed, in line with the intent of Ruin, while Surgebinding demands forging bonds.
Shards are capable of tampering with Investiture that does not belong to them.


This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

>“*It's as if the future is a shattering window. The further you look, the more pieces that window breaks into. The near future can be anticipated, but the distant future… I can only guess.*”
\-Honor[104]


Shards can perceive the future, although it can be difficult for them. Some are better at it than others, with [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]] being noted as particularly excelling. Like all seers, Shards can be wrong about both what they see and how they interpret it, although as a general rule they see further than non-Shards. Shardic power can also be utilized by others to perceive the future as they do: examples of this are [[Atium\|atium]], as well as the visions of the [[Returned\|Returned]].
Both [[Preservation\|Preservation]] and [[Honor\|Honor]] describe seeing the future as not one set path, but a tangled web of linked possibilities, as well as the circumstances necessary to bring them about, with some being more likely than others. As a result, predicting the future is not a straightforward process, and is not equally useful to all seers. Upon Ascension to [[Odium\|Odium]], [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] realized that there are possibilities of future that Rayse had not seen, implying the future sight ability may be related to the Vessel as well.
It is theorized that a Shard's intent may be tied to its proficiency with future sight. Preservation, as a Shard dedicated to keeping things existing, and Cultivation, a Shard dedicated to growing something in a desired form, would hold a natural interest in predicting what the future will hold which may make them more proficient with this ability. By contrast, a Shard like Ruin, which is interested only in destroying things, and Honor, about holding to one's oaths, would not have "seeing ahead" as part of their nature.

## Forms and Subdivisions
 by  Kyle Pearson  [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] with her daughter-[[Spren\|spren]], the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]
>“*I'm still a spren. I’m a little piece of God.*”
\-Syl[120]


The raw Investiture of a Shard can take distinct forms and states. As a solid, the Investiture is metallic, and is thus sometimes referred to as a **God Metal**. Examples of God Metals are [[Atium\|atium]], [[Lerasium\|lerasium]], [[Raysium\|raysium]], and the alloy of [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] that forms [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]]. God Metals typically have properties within the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]], regardless of what Shard they're aligned with.
Shardic power is the most potent as a liquid. It typically coalesces in one place on a planet, forming a **perpendicularity**. A perpendicularity represents a tremendous amount of power, enough so to pierce all three Realms, allowing people to slide between them. Examples of such perpendicularities are the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]], or the [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Lake]].
As a gas, the Shardic power can take on a number of different functions. Examples of Investiture in gaseous forms include [[Breath\|Breath]], [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], and Preservation's mists. All can serve as fuel for magic. In both [[Awakening\|Awakening]] and [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], gaseous Investiture is, in fact, the primary source of magic, but even in systems that use other substances, like [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], gaseous Investiture can serve the same purpose.

### Slivers
For more information, see [[Sliver\|Sliver]].
A Sliver is a person who has held the power of a Shard, and then released it. This "stretches" a person's [[Spiritweb\|spiritweb]], noticeably altering them. There is some grey area as to how much power one needs to have to be considered a Sliver; however, a person who directly handled Shardic power is the most straightforward example. The [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] and [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] would both be considered Slivers, while [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] and [[Returned\|Returned]] would not.

### Splinters
For more information, see [[Splinter\|Splinter]].
A Splinter is a fragment of a Shard's power, similar to how a Shard is a fragment of Adonalsium's power. Unlike Slivers or [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]], Splinters don't generally have a Physical component. They often have a mind of their own, separate and distinct from that of their parent Shard. They can form in two distinct ways: either by the Shard being splintered (killed), or by the Shard directly splitting off splinters of itself.
Splinters can be comprised of the Investiture of one or more Shards. Examples of splinters include the divine [[Breath\|Breath]] of the [[Returned\|Returned]], [[Aon\|Aons]] within [[Seon\|seons]], and [[Spren\|spren]]. It is possible to create a new Shard from splinters of multiple other Shards, though it is much more difficult than it sounds.

## Champion
It is possible for a Shard to name a "champion" when making a deal with another Shard. Honor encouraged [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] to try to get Odium to agree to a contest of champions; Odium eventually agreed and attempted to name Dalinar as his champion, though Dalinar declined. The Heralds are similar to champions and Shards outside of the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]] have also had champions.
