## Appearance and Anatomy
Greatshells refers to a variety of creatures both aquatic and land-bound. They do, however, share a number of physical characteristics. They are uniformly massive, vastly larger than a human; the largest creatures on the planet, both on land and in the water, are greatshells. They possess an exoskeleton, and multiple legs. They have no tongue, and a complex set of jaws; though it's unclear if they're all carnivorous, it is unlikely. Their blood is violet, and has a musty, moldy smell.
Greatshells breed slowly, and for most species, their populations are generally small. They all reproduce the same way: an adult greatshell transforms (pupates) into a chrysalis, which eventually produces a number of young. They do not seem to have a singular biome they thrive in; they can be found as far east as the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], as far west as [[Aimia\|Aimia]], and as far north as the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]]. Their sheer size makes domesticating most species unfeasible, although there are stories of greatshell riders in places like [[Kadrix\|Kadrix]]. If the [[Chull\|chulls]] are considered greatshells -- which is unclear -- it would make them the only case of widely-spread domestication of greatshells.

### Spren bonds
The greatshells maintain their enormous size by bonding with [[Mandra\|mandras]], a type of [[Spren\|spren]]. Mandras decrease their weight, allowing them to exist and move their bulk in defiance of square-cube law. Aquatic greatshells may not need a bond. Perhaps to facilitate this bond, greatshells possess [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]], massive gemstones, within their bodies. For this reason, they're often hunted; some species, like the [[Lanceryn\|lanceryn]] and [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]], have been hunted down to extinction or near-extinction over their gemhearts.
