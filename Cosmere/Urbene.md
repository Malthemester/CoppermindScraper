**Urbene** was a small village in the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The village consisted of ten large wooden hovels built in a loose circle with a well in the center, and a [[Noble\|nobleman's]] manor a little farther up the valley. The [[Skaa\|skaa]] of Urbene were herdsmen. The village itself lay in a quiet hollow amid the rising landscape. It was described as picturesque. 
[[Sazed\|Sazed]] visited Urbene on his way to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. He found the village full of corpses of skaa that had died from starvation and dehydration. They were too scared to leave their hovels as the [[Mists\|mists]] were out during the day, and had already killed skaa like [[Jell\|Jell]] who went outside. Only one of them survived because of cannibalism, and this crazed villager explained Sazed what had happened there.
