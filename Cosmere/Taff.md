**Taff** is a servant in [[Mercystar\|Mercystar's]] palace in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
Taff is in a hallway with three other servants when they are attacked by [[Vasher\|Vasher]] as he infiltrates the palace. Taff is immediately tied up with an [[Awakening\|Awakened]] rope. [[Rariv\|Rariv]] and another servant run for help; [[Lolan\|Lolan]] becomes distracted by [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] and is knocked unconscious by Vasher. When help arrives, the rope binding Taff is no longer Awakened, but he has been stabbed and killed. After interviewing the witnesses, [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] deduces that the initial assailant (Vasher) was not the murderer. The killer was [[Denth\|Denth]], who was tailing Vasher. Taff was presumably killed because he was the only person who would have been able to identify Denth.
