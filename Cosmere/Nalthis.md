## Geography
The major settings of *Warbreaker* are [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]], the capital city of Hallandren, and Hallandren's bordering mountain state of Idris. The jungles are situated in a large valley surrounded by mountains and a sea.
Not much is known about the geography of Nalthis. There is an inland sea that is valuable for trade, and at least a third of the coast is owned by Hallandren.
Hallandren is unique in the known world of Nalthis as being the only place that [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] will grow, as well as being the only jungle climate.
Idris is located to the north of Hallandren. It controls the passes through the mountains, which are very profitable for trade. It can be inferred that a few well-populated nations are located past these mountains and beyond the reach of the inland sea. Idris also contains some copper mines.

## Flora and Fauna
Nalthis has diverse species of palms, savanna animals, and the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]]. Elephants and Zebras are said to be exotic creatures from "the South." Whether this means they come from southern Hallandren or south of Hallandren is unclear.

## History
Nalthian history is mostly unknown. [[Vasher\|Vasher]] remarked that the planet is young enough that it does not have fossils.
At some time in the far past, [[Vo\|Vo]] traveled over the sea and became a [[Returned\|Returned]], creating Hallandren, which occupied the location of the previous Pahn Kahl nation. The Returned created a religion and nation with themselves as the focus of both. After some time, the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]] came together and catalyzed the [[Manywar\|Manywar]], which resulted in the separation of the Idrian nation (after the royal family deserted Hallandren for Idris, for disputed reasons) and the rise of the [[God King\|God Kings]] and absolutism of the [[Iridescent Tones\|Iridescent Tones]].
About 300 years after the Manywar, the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]] occurred. This was also when the Idrian princess [[Siri\|Siri]] married the God King [[Susebron\|Susebron]], bringing a member of the royal family back to Hallandren.

## Cosmere
The [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Endowment\|Endowment]] has been confirmed to be present on Nalthis. This has had the effect that every human born on Nalthis is born with one [[Breath\|Breath]], the source of energy for [[Awakening\|Awakening]] and Returning. Endowment is related to the [[Tears of Edgli\|flowers]] which grow around T'Telir, the capital city of Hallandren. Endowment has been known to revive recently deceased people, awarding them a single [[Divine Breath\|Divine Breath]] under the requirement that they consume a normal Breath once a week to stay alive. It is believed, and confirmed for at least three characters, that all [[Returned\|Returned]] come back to fulfill some divine goal. It is unknown what Endowment's purpose is, or how long she has been doing this. *Warbreaker* accounts for only a brief history, which mentions [[Vo\|Vo]] as being the "first Returned", according to the [[Idris\|Idris]] religion.

## Trivia
Nalthians know what [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragons]] are.
