## Location and Layout
 by  Isaac Stewart  The Outer Market is visible at the crossroads near the center of the warcamps
The Outer Market is located near the center of the warcamps, just north of [[Vamah\|Vamah]] and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] camps. It is not far from the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]], although it is separated from the palace complex by a steep hill.
The market consists of ramshackle buildings built from stone blocks quarried nearby. It is not well-organized, nor does it have a defensive wall like the warcamps. It includes many different shops, including multiple wine shops and some restaurants. Because the market is situated on a hill, some shops have patio terraces that provide views of the warcamps. The market also contains stables and a menagerie. When a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] approaches, merchants quickly take down their tents and close up doors and windows; the market provides stone bunkers where patrons can wait out the storm.

## Operation
The Outer Market is largely unregulated; it falls under the purview of the [[Highprince of Commerce\|Highprince of Commerce]], but this position was vacant during the reigns of [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]]. It is among the few places where people from multiple warcamps mix, as it is considered to be neutral territory. The customers are therefore very eclectic; many of the merchants are [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]]. It competes with the markets that are inside each warcamp.

## History
The Market‚Äôs disorganized nature was due to the fact that it was built quickly during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] without the planning that went into the warcamps themselves. Because it was still new, the ornamental [[Shalebark\|shalebark]] used in landscaping was only a few inches high.
Although some parts of the market were a bit seedy, it also had luxurious establishments that were frequented by high-ranking [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] from different princedoms, providing opportunities for social interaction. However, due to the lack of regulation, crime in the market began to increase, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] assigned several battalions of his troops to patrol the Outer Market and areas between the warcamps. Although these patrols cut down on bandits, they weakened Dalinar's ability to go on plateau runs to capture [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]]. When Kaladin was promoted to the rank of captain, he suggested that the former [[Bridgemen\|bridgemen]] in his command be assigned to these patrols to gain experience, to the amusement of [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]]. Despite its chaotic nature, Dalinar wondered whether the Outer Market would become more permanent as the Alethi solidified their control over the Shattered Plains.
The fate of the Outer Market after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] is unclear. Most of the population of the warcamps moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], presumably including some of the merchants who set up shop in the [[Breakaway\|Breakaway]]. When [[Shallan\|Veil]] visited the warcamps looking for [[Ialai\|Ialai]], she noted that even the markets within the warcamps had fallen into disrepair; the Outer Market likely suffered a similar fate.
