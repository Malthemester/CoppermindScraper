>“* The more successful Szeth was, the more audacious Makkek became. How long before he stopped using Szeth to kill minor rivals, instead sending him to kill Shardbearers or powerful lighteyes?*”
\- Szeth on his master[1]


**Makkek** is a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] criminal in [[Bavland\|Bavland]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He owns [[Szeth\|Szeth]] for a short while before being killed by one of [[Taravangian\|Taravangian's]] assassins.

## Appearance and Personality
Makkek is a short, lean man, although he grows more plump before his death. He's extremely ambitious and self-confident, to the point of recklessness, and has no problem flaunting his wealth. He has a flair for the dramatic, even when it's highly impractical. At the same time, he's extremely paranoid, and has no compunctions against having people who stand in his way killed. This being said, he does not demand that Szeth murder everyone even remotely connected to his target, though this might be a matter of carelessness rather than mercy.
Like all [[Bavland\|Bavlanders]], he has a habit of saying "I" as "Oi".

## History
Makkek was a part of a group of footpads operating in the town of [[Ironsway\|Ironsway]] in Bavland when they killed [[Took\|Took]], Szeth's master at the time. When Makkek noticed Szeth holding Took's dead body, he called him over, intending to quiet him if the need arose, but while searching Took's belongings, he picked up Szeth's [[Oathstone\|Oathstone]]. Upon learning how it worked, he decided to keep it. Shortly afterwards, he ordered Szeth to kill his fellow footpads in order to keep the Oathstone's existence a secret.
For some time afterwards, Makkek had Szeth assassinate his rivals and act as his bodyguard, building the [[Shin\|Shin's]] reputation as a deadly shadow -- and his own reputation as a criminal mastermind by association. He moved to [[Bornwater\|Bornwater]], the largest mining town in Bavland, and used Szeth's skills to suborn or destroy pretty much every business and criminal in the city. This allowed him to amass considerable wealth, which he flaunted with silk clothes and numerous lovers. His ambitions stretched further, as he intended to move to [[Kneespike\|Kneespike]], the residence of a local lord. Throughout that time, Szeth never told him about having a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], although Makkek eventually began to figure it out after rumors of burned-out eyes began to spread.
At one point, a man named [[Gavashaw\|Gavashaw]] opened a tavern in Bornwater and ignored Makkek's demands, having the favor of the lord in Kneespike. This prompted Makkek to send Szeth to kill him; however, the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] had been waiting for such an opportunity. As soon as Szeth left to kill Gavashaw, their assassin murdered Makkek and took the Oathstone, then brought it and Makkek's head to Szeth.
