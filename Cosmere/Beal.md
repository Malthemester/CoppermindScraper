**Beal** is one of [[House Davar\|House Davar's]] guards before [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar's]] later association with the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]].
By the year 1172, Beal was no longer one of House Davar's guards. [[Balat Davar\|Balat Davar]] noticed his absence, and compared the old guards, Beal and [[Ten\|Ten]], with [[Levrin\|Levrin]] and [[Rin\|Rin]], the newer ones. Balat considered Beal a soldier one could joke with, and almost a friend, unlike the new guards.
