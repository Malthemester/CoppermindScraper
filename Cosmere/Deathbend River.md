The **Deathbend River** is a river in southern [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. It runs through the [[Eastern Crownlands\|Eastern Crownlands]] and flows into the [[Mevan Bay\|Mevan Bay]]. It is one of the most consistent rivers on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and does not dry up, even during the [[Midpeace\|Midpeace]]. It is on a good caravan route.
There are six or seven villages along its southern fork including one town of note.
[[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] were exploring a tributary of the Deathbend when they discovered the [[Listener\|listeners]].
As a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] of the fourth [[Dahn\|dahn]] [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] rules a section of land along the south fork of the river. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] chose to give that plot for him since its local brightlord had died causing the land to revert to the crown.
