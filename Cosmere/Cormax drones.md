The **cormax drones** are a species or peoples known to the [[Superiority\|Superiority]].
Next to nothing is known about them, other than that they're highly aggressive, but not as capable as humans, and that they do not produce many [[Cytonics\|cytonics]]. The manner in which they're referred to -- "*a* cormax drone" -- suggests that drones may be a caste or a group within some greater cormax species, similar to some bug populations, and their aggression may be due to protecting other cormax; however, this is purely speculative.
