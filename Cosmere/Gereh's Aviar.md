## History
 by  clarinking  With [[Lift\|Lift]]
It is unknown how Gereh obtained his Aviar. He did not keep it with him commonly during his duties as a steward; however, he did bring it with him during his everyday life in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. During the pair's stay there, [[Mraize\|Mraize]] murdered Gereh for unknown reasons. The Aviar of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] operative then attempted to kill Gereh's Aviar, mortally wounding it as it mourned over Gereh's corpse. Lift took it with her, only to be captured by Mraize. However, she kept it for the duration of her captivity, and took it with her when [[Venli\|Venli]] rescued her.
