## Appearance
Like all [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]], Firestorm is about six feet long and very broad. It has a long, straight handle with a ring pommel and no crossguard. The blade is symmetrical, and shaped like flames burning in the direction of the handle, broad near the base and coming to a sharp point at the very tip. It's appearance is sometimes described as "wicked". In low light, it seems to almost glow.

## History
It's unknown when [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] bonded the blade; it's possible he inherited it, as the Kholin household had a number of wooden practice Shardblades in his childhood. He already has it at the [[Rift\|Rift]], and wields it throughout the entire war of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar's]] unification.
Gavilar uses Firestorm to defend himself from [[Szeth\|Szeth]] when the latter arrives to assassinate him, but to no avail. Following his death, Firestorm becomes a practice Blade for [[Alethi\|Alethi]] who don't posses their own Shards. Any [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] can loan it from King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], as the Shardblades are difficult to master and should a Shardbearer fall, another must be able to immediately pick up and use their weapon. In addition, Firestorm is often used for dueling by brightlords who do not have a Blade. Among others, [[Resi\|Resi]] wields it in a duel against [[Adolin\|Adolin]], as does [[Eranniv\|Eranniv]].
Its fate after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] is unknown. Presumably, it was taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with the rest of the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] warcamp.

## Trivia
Gavilar has a habit of summoning and dismissing Firestorm time after time when he's about to engage in battle. His nephew [[Adolin\|Adolin]] does the same with [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]].
Firestorm is never named in the text proper of *Stormlight Archive*, only in Shallan's sketch of the royal Shardblades. As such, it's unclear whether Gavilar called it by that name or if it only came to be known as Firestorm after his death.
The reason for the above seems to be that the Firestorm was named by [[Ben McSweeney\|Ben McSweeney]], the author of [[Shallan's sketchbook\|Shallan's sketchbook]] illustrations, when he was told to draw the royal Blades, rather than by Brandon himself.
