**Classical Scadrial** or the **classical era of Scadrial** refers to the period of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial's]] history directly preceding the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]] and the beginning of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].
The general level of technology at the end of this era was more advanced than that of the Final Empire. Before [[Rashek\|Rashek's]] Ascension, the people of Classical Scadrial had achieved steam technology, and were close to achieving locomotive technology.
During this time period, [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] was almost entirely unheard of. Towards the end of the era, when the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] arrived, it began to snap people into Mistings; Mistborn did not appear until Rashek discovered and used the [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] was the most wide-spread of the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]], and even that remained isolated with the [[Terris\|Terris]] people. The Terris [[Worldbringer\|Worldbringers]] in particular were known for using Feruchemy to record lore. [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] was entirely unknown of, though the Hero of Ages did wear Hemalurgically-charged piercings as a result of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] manipulating the [[Terris Prophecies\|Terris Prophecies]].
There were many different societies and nations on classical Scadrial, including ancient [[Terris\|Terris]], the [[Astalsi\|Astalsi]], the [[Khlenni\|Khlenni]], [[Kordel\|Kordel]], and the many religions that [[Sazed\|Sazed]] taught of during his life as a [[Keeper\|Keeper]]. Notable individuals born in this time period included [[Rashek\|Rashek]], [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]], [[Alendi\|Alendi]] and [[Haddek\|Haddek]].
