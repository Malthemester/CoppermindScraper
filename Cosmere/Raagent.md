\-Raagent to Kenton after he killed the second KaRak.[3]

He goes on a hunting trip to the deep sands in an attempt to avoid [[Kenton\|Kenton]], but Kenton and [[Aarik\|Aarik]] chase after him. When they arrive Raagent invites Kenton to join him on his deep [[Sandling\|sandling]] hunt. On the ride to the deep sand they discuss the different types of sandlings, and Raagent asks Kenton how much it will cost him to hire the sand masters. He says that the reason he wants to dismantle the Diem is so he could have their prestige for himself, and he cares nothing for their power. He then says that he has changed his and simply wants the Diem destroyed. He goes off to deal the killing blow to the [[KaRak\|KaRak]] his soldiers captured and weakened for him. Kenton starts to walk away and suddenly a woman comes flying towards him and he turns around to see a much larger KaRak, the first one's mother, attacking Raagent and his soldiers. Kenton distracts the sandling, giving Aarik an opening to ride in on his [[Tonk\|tonk]], saving Raagent's life. Kenton then goes back and uses his sand to kill the creature. Raagent is impressed by Kenton's showing, and after Kenton agrees to give the Tower a contingent of sand masters to use, Raagent agrees to vote for the Diem. Kenton leaves, and Aarik and his father eat together for the first time in years.
He tries to set up a meeting with Senior [[Trackt\|Trackt]] [[Ais\|Ais]] to betray [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]]. Sharezan finds out and traps the building, but Raagent realizes in time and escapes safely.
Presumably as revenge for his attempted betrayal, Sharezan personally executes Raagent in a brutal fashion. He sneaks into Raagent's sleeping chambers in the Tower, uses Raagent's [[ShalRim\|ShalRim]] bed sheets to tie him up, and then brings him down into the Tower's wine cellar where his cries for help won't be heard. Sharezan props Raagent up against a wall and lights candles to provide some light in the darkness of the cellar. He then dosed him with [[Kamo\|kamo]], an emotional stimulant, and cut off his eyelids. Since, like all Daysiders, Raagent was afraid of the dark, the kamo, combined with the growing darkness from the candles burning out, caused Raagent's mind to conjure up all sorts of horrors. Since he couldn't close his eyes he was forced to endure these nightmares until he died from the fright. [[Baon\|Baon]] theorizes that the murder was done in order to lessen Kenton's chances of winning all of the [[Taishin\|Taishins']] votes, since Raagent was one of Kenton's supporters.
After Raagent's death, at Kenton's request, Aarik reluctantly becomes the new Lord General in his father's place and votes in favor of the Diem.

## Relationships
He is the father of [[Aarik\|Aarik]], whom he disowned at some point in the past.
He was dealing with [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]]. It is unclear what exactly their relationship was.
## Trivia
In the [[White Sand (prose)\|prose]] he was named Reegent.
