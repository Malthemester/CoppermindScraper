>“*She is speaking to my father, and he is laughing. Laughing and holding her. We are all there, including Helaran. He never left. The people my mother knew... Dreder... never came to our home. Mother loves me. She teaches me philosophy, and she shows me how to draw.*”

**Dreder** is an associate of [[Shallan's mother\|Shallan's mother]].
Dreder's association with her mother is one of the things [[Shallan\|Shallan]] wishes never happened. It is possible that they are the [[Skybreaker\|Skybreaker]] acolyte who Shallan's mother is intimate with, or the person with Shallan's mother when she died.
