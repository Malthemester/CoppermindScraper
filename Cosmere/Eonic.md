**Eonic** is a blacksmith who lives in New Elantris in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].
Eonic is one of the "incomplete" [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] living in the crumbling city during the period after the [[Reod\|Reod]]. As an Elantrian, he is of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] descent, and his name is based on Aon Eon.
He is among the skilled workers enlisted by [[Raoden\|Raoden]] to help improve the quality of life in New Elantris, and is noted as one of the few Elantrians to remain committed to Raoden's plans after [[Sarene\|Sarene]] begins handing out food at the city gates. When Raoden asks Sarene for steel, she spitefully sends him thousands of bent nails, but he believes Eonic will find a use for them. It is not known if Eonic survived to see the restoration of Elantris and [[AonDor\|AonDor]].
