## Gameplay Focus
Compared to many other role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, the Mistborn Adventure Game has a light focus on rules and a strong focus on storytelling and player character development, using a semi-theatrical approach. Items are called "Props," and there are separate combat rules for dealing with enemies that have names and enemies without names, termed "Extras" (and are much easier to plow through). One striking gameplay mechanic is the rule that player characters will gain experience and strength more quickly if they suffer serious setbacks (and survive), even if they may also be temporarily or even permanently crippled by the experience. This both encourages pushing the limits of a character and aids richer storytelling as characters grow and develop through their adventures.
As would be expected, all flavors of Scadrian play prominent roles in character creation and gameplay.
