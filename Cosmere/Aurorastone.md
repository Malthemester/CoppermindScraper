**Aurorastones** are magical stones found in [[Alornia\|Alornia]] that are used to power various mechanisms. The stones are capable of being charged via [[Lancing\|Lancing]], and are used to maintain Lancing feats without [[Kairominas\|Kairominas]] needing to be around. It is implied that the power of an Aurorastone diminishes over time, and that Kai must then recharge them with Lancing.
The known uses for Aurorastone include weather control, automated carriages resembling cars within Alornia cities, and enchanted swords.
