**Firestorm Flight** is one of three cadet flights training at the [[DDF\|DDF]] [[Flight School\|Flight School]], alongside [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward]] and [[Inkwell Flight\|Inkwell]]. [[Remark\|Remark]] and [[Drama\|Drama]] may be some of Firestorm members.

## History
Firestorm Flight was formed at the start of the new [[Flight School\|Flight School]] year, with presumably ten members. Unlike Skyward, which began with light-lances, Firestorm's training focused on dogfighting. Over time, Admiral [[Judy Ivans\|Ivans]] began sending them up to support full pilots, as a way to alleviate the staffing shortages.
Much like the other flights, Firestorm suffered tremendous losses, although whether this was mostly due to combat or parents pulling their children out is unknown. [[Spensa\|Spensa]] and [[FM\|FM]] ate dinner with members of Firestorm and [[Inkwell Flight\|Inkwell Flights]] near the end of the course; at this point, the two flights totalled six members, meaning Firestorm had lost at least half of their original squad. This included their original flightleader.
Following the graduation, the surviving members -- if there were any -- were placed into other, fuller flights.
