The **Field of Rebirth** is the site at which the survivors emerged after the reshaping of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] following the ascension of [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. It is also the last resting place of [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]].
The field is covered with [[Marewill flowers\|Marewill flowers]] all year round thanks to a hot spring underneath. The tomb is capped by statues of the "Last Emperor" and the "Ascendant Warrior," Elend and Vin respectively.
At the time of [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] the field is at the center of [[Elendel\|Elendel]] forming the hub for the system of canals radiating out of the city. It is also the point through which [[Scadrial\|Scadrial's]] prime meridian passes, as measured by the [[Canton of Cartography\|Canton of Cartography]].

## Tombs
Both [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend\|Elend]] are buried there, in a crypt under the statues in their honor. The crypt was set above the main entrance to the [[Kandra Homeland\|kandra Homeland]] as well as the storage caches people used to survive the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
They serve as both a museum dedicated to the [[Originators\|Originators]] and a mausoleum for [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]]. The museum is composed of a network of caves that Originators hid in during the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]]. The subjects covered by the museum include the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]], works by the Originators, [[Kelsier\|The Survivor]], and the [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] metals. The museum also has replicas of [[Sazed\|Sazed's]] armbands and the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]].
An entrance to the [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[Kandra Homeland\|Homeland]] is hidden within the room dedicated to [[Atium\|atium]].
