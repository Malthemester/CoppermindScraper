The **Mastrell's Path** is the name of a test used by the [[Diem\|sand masters]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. The rules do not restrict who may take the test, although it is meant only for those who have already achieved the highest rank of mastrell. The test is not mandatory and many mastrells choose not to take it. The Path was created by the very most powerful and egotistical [[Sand mastery\|sand masters]] as a way of showcasing their superiority and is therefore extraordinarily challenging.
The Path consists of five spheres hidden around the [[Kerla\|Kerla]]. The challenger is not allowed to take any [[Qido\|water]] and must find as many spheres as he can within a [[Dayside\|Dayside]] hour, or 100 minutes. The challenger is monitored by a group of mastrells; he may request help at any time, but if he does, his run is automatically terminated. There is no "pass" or "fail", as one's performance is judged by how many spheres he is able to obtain within the time limit.
Central to the Path is a massive deep [[Sandling\|sandling]], specifically a Marken, normally only found in the deep sands but isolated on the Kerla for unknown reasons. This sandling is even more rare because it is [[Terken\|terken]], or immune to the powers of sand mastery. The Mastrells have fed the creature for centuries and use it as the final guardian for the fifth sphere.
The intended solution for the Marken was to slatrify sand into water and use it to scare the creature away. Kenton, who could not slatrify, was forced to use his sword instead to kill the creature, forever ruining the Path.
When [[Traiben\|Traiben]] ran the Path he only found three spheres. When he slatrified and frightened away the sandling, its digging buried his last sphere deep beneath the sand, preventing him from retrieving it.
