>“*This is what you do, killing spren. You should feel ashamed.*”
\-The inkspren to Adolin[1]


The **inkspren shopkeeper** lives and works in [[Nameless\|Nameless]] and is business partners with [[Testament\|Testament]]. He sells books.

## Appearance and Personality
>“*Do you know something of this, human? The danger that is?... New deadeyes. Radiants should not have started again.*”
\-Inkspren to Adolin[1]

Like other inkspren, the shopkeeper has a jetblack stonelike body, with a top sheen that looks like oil on water and reflects color based on the direction of light. He has a nasally accent.
He does not enjoy talking to humans and is rather cold towards them during interactions. He thinks poorly of them due to the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] and particularly the death of his friend and business partner. The inkspren believes that it is in humans nature to kill their spren.
He is a bookseller and takes care with his wares, setting them out neatly on shelves instead of in piles or stacks.
He appears to be relatively familiar with [[Alethi\|Alethi]] or [[Vorin\|Vorin]] culture; he speaks Alethi and is aware of the divide between masculine and feminine arts.

## History
>“*A friend she was… My partner in business, once.*”
\-The shopkeeper talking about Testament[1]


The inkspren shopkeeper and Testament met and began a business together centuries before Testament's death. In 1165, Testament departed from their business to pursue [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and bond her.
In 1174, the inkspren found Testament alone on an island, in the eastern section of [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. After their reunion, Testament insisted on heading west, and the inkspren followed her, eventually setting up his bookshop in Nameless.
The inkspren was approached by [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Maya\|Maya]] during their visit to Nameless in 1175 where they asked him questions about Testament and what happened to her. He frostily explained to them that she was a new [[Deadeye\|deadeye]] and had been killed a decade prior when her [[Nahel bond\|nahel bond]] was broken.
