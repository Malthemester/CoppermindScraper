\-Tift to other kids in Hearthstone[1]

**Tift** is a resident of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. His father is a farmer, and is apparently good at that.
He plays with the other children in the village, including [[Jost\|Jost]], [[Jest\|Jest]], [[Mord\|Mord]], [[Naget\|Naget]] and [[Khav\|Khav]].
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] uses his name as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' names, unlike his own.
