**Timewasters Guide** or **TWG** was the official fan forum for Brandon, up until its collapse in 2011. It was also the fansite of other authors up to that time, such as [[Dan Wells\|Dan Wells]] and [[Howard Tayler\|Howard Tayler]]. It was initially set up as a means of communication between Brandon and various other friends, and wasn't repaired in 2011 due to the availability of other software such as Facebook.
