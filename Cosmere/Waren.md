Lord **Waren** is a noble in [[Arelon\|Arelon]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. His conversion to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] is an important part of the gyorn [[Hrathen\|Hrathen's]] plan to convert all of Arelon.

## Appearance & Personality
Waren is thin and has nearly-white blond hair. [[Daora\|Daora]] considers him young. He is intelligent and shrewd, with a keen understanding of power and political advantage. He carries himself with an air of accomplishment and control. Before his conversion to Shu-Dereth, he was widely known in Arelon as a pious [[Shu-Korath\|Korathi]], which had gained him notoriety among the nobility. Many people believe that his extreme piety was more opportunistic than genuine, and used for political gain.

## History
Waren is the oldest son of Baron [[Diolen\|Diolen]], the owner of Kie Plantation. His deceased mother's name is unknown, but she was an acquaintance of [[Eshen\|Eshen]], who considered her a decent woman and an excellent knitter.
When [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] came to Arelon with the intention of converting the nation to Shu-Dereth, he began by meeting with several young nobles in [[Kae\|Kae]], including Waren. Hrathen was surprised that he had accompanied his cousin [[Idan\|Idan]] to the meeting because of Waren's reputation. Hrathen realized that Waren could be a valuable tool to him, and set to work convincing him that converting would bring him power and influence. Waren was concerned that it would take too long to unseat the power of Shu-Korath in Arelon, but Hrathen convinced him that the decline of Shu-Korath had been happening for a long time, using the fall of the [[Duladel Republic\|Duladel Republic]] as an example. Waren left the meeting with a newfound respect for Hrathen.
Later, Waren claimed to have seen a vision of [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] commanding him to convert to Shu-Dereth. His abrupt conversion after years of strict adherence to Shu-Korath caused a stir among the nobles of Arelon. At one point, he was the topic of gossip among the women in [[Eshen\|Eshen's]] retinue, including [[Sarene\|Sarene]]. When Sarene attended a ball at Duke [[Telrii\|Telrii's]] estate with [[Shuden\|Shuden]], Waren was in attendance as part of Hrathen's group. Though he wasn't technically supposed to be in [[Iadon\|Iadon's]] more exclusive room at the party, Waren used his proximity to Hrathen to attend anyway. Shuden noted to Sarene that Waren's conversion was worrisome due to his reputation, which Shuden believed to be opportunistic rather than genuine. Sarene took Waren's conversion as a dangerous sign for the nation, since it marked an important step in Hrathen's plan.
Eventually [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] took Waren and many of Hrathen's other key supporters as [[Odiv\|odivs]] as part of his move to destabilize the gyorn. After Hrathen wrested back some control over the church in Arelon, he made Dilaf relieve his odivs, including Waren, of their oaths. Waren then became a krondet to Dilaf instead.
