>“*We will stop this from going further, Cuna. We’ll resist Winzik. Clean up his mess.*”
\-Zezin to Cuna[1]


**Zezin** is a [[Figment\|figment]] who serves Minister [[Cuna\|Cuna]] in the [[Superiority\|Superiority]].
Zezin uses a variety of scents to portray their emotions, including wet soil to indicate anger and rotting fruit for sorrow and anguish.
Zezin did not initially believe Cuna when they suggested that [[Winzik\|Winzik]] would attempt to summon a [[Delver\|delver]], and were shocked and angry when [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]] was attacked by one of the beings. Despite the situation at hand, Zenzin did not believe that Winzik intended for the delver to assault the space station, or that he was using it to destroy the Superiority government for his own gain. Cuna urged Zenzin to escape Starsight without them as they would be unable to keep up with the figment. Before departing, Zenzin promised Cuna that they would continue to resist Winzik and try to rectify the situation.
Some time after escaping the Superiority, Cuna mentioned having allies among the figments that they had been unable to contact, possibly referring to Zezin.
