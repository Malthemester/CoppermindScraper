An **Oculator** is someone that can activate and control an Oculatory Lens.
The [[House Smedry\|Smedry]] family is one of the most renowned groups of Oculators. Oculatory powers are primarily hereditary, though they can be inherited either through the bloodline or through marriage. There are two known exceptions to this hereditary limitation: Warrior's Lenses and Blood-Forged Lenses can be used by anyone.
Among the [[Librarian\|Librarians]], there are [[Dark Oculator\|Dark Oculators]], who often use offensive lenses and [[Alivened\|Alivened]].

## Oculatory Lenses
Lenses are only usable by , unless they are forged in the blood of an Oculator, such as the ones used by the [[Scrivener's Bones\|Scrivener's Bones]]. [[Dark Oculator\|Dark Oculators]] sometimes use a monocle instead of the classic glasses shape, in order to focus the lens' power. Powerful oculators can use different lenses in each eye, and exceptionally skilled oculators can push power through multiple sets of lenses, up to 7 or 8, causing them to hover in front of one another. The oculator can choose between using all of them at once, or firing off alternating blasts of power.
The [[Highbrary\|Highbrary]] has defenses that causes any Oculator using a lens to glow.
Lenses include:

















































[[Fitzroy\|Fitzroy]] is seen wearing a pair of green and orange striped glasses when upon entering the Royal Archives (not a library).
A pair of Lenses heightens [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry's]] awareness of enemy locations. These may be Oculator's Lenses, but it is unclear.
