**Elashe** is a historic [[Aonic\|Aonic]] princess on [[Sel\|Sel]].
She was a descendant of [[Raoshem\|Raoshem]], the first king of [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. A few decades after Arelon was founded, people began to be taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] and becoming [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]]. Elashe was among the first to be taken, and the first of Raoshem's line.
Elashe claimed to have seen Aon Ehe inscribed on a coal in her hearth the day after she transformed. This has led to the belief that a rock or piece of coal inscribed with Aon Ehe is good luck and provides protection against winter spirits.
