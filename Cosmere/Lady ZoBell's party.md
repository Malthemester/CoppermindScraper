**Lady ZoBell's Party** is an event that takes place in [[ZoBell Tower\|ZoBell Tower]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]].
This is the first party held in the penthouse of [[ZoBell Tower\|ZoBell Tower]] and was planned around the governor‚Äôs spring dinner and policy speech. Invitations were sent to the upper crust of the society, both in Elendel and beyond.
As [[Steris\|Steris]] predicts, the coach attendants at the entrance of the tower were not properly prepared to handle all of the traffic and it backs up significantly. This is complicated by increased security due to the assassination attempt on the governor earlier that day. As a result they are turning away anyone who is not specifically on the guest list, even if they have procured an invitation.
[[Wayne\|Wayne]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] both end up on the list of people who are not to be let in under any circumstances. Wayne uses a time bubble to sneakily examine the guest list and determines that he should impersonate Professor [[Hanlanaze\|Hanlanaze]]. Marasi aids him in this disguise.
While Wax and Steris are talking to Governor Innate, Bleeder begins to talk mentally to Wax. The conversation includes a threat to Wax's father, who Wax takes to mean [[Jackstom Harms\|Steris's father]]. After carefully studying the movements of everyone else in the room, Wax concludes that Bleeder is impersonating a particular waiter. There is a scuffle in which Wayne tackles the waiter and is dog-piled by the governor's guards. The waiter escapes in the confusion and Wax spots him near a window. Bleeder tries to distract Wax by mentioning Lessie, but Wax shoots at the waiter anyway and misses, hitting a window instead. The waiter smashes the window and leaps out. Wax follows.
