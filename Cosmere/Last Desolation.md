>“*The stories are wrong, aren’t they? We didn’t defeat the enemy for good, as the Heralds claimed. They lied.*”
\-Dalinar to the Stormfather[1]


The **Last Desolation**, also known as **Aharietiam** in [[Vorin\|Vorin]] tradition and the **Day of Glory** in [[Azir\|Azir]], is believed to be the last [[Desolation\|Desolation]], when mankind's hard-won victory over the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] ended the cycle of [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. In reality, nine of the ten [[Herald\|Heralds]] abandoned their [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]] in an attempt to leave the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] and avoid further torture on [[Braize\|Braize]]. [[Talenel\|Talenel]] was the only Herald not to break the Oathpact. Dalinar Kholin visited this [[Desolation\|Desolation]] in one of the visions left by [[Honor\|Honor]].

## History

>“*A…a decision has been made. It is time for the Oathpact to end.*”
\-Jezrien to Kalak[4]


There was less than a year between the last two Desolations.
During the fighting, only one Herald, [[Taln\|Taln]], who was the only one to have never broken under torture, died. The surviving Heralds were afraid of the torture they would suffer on returning to [[Braize\|Braize]]. Eight of the Heralds, all the survivors except [[Kalak\|Kalak]], met at the appointed meeting place. Rather than return, they drove their blades into the ground and walked in different directions. [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] waited for Kalak to arrive and they both left as well. Although they had been warned remaining on Roshar would lead to a new Desolation immediately starting, [[Ishar\|Ishar]] believed Taln alone would be enough to uphold the Oathpact. Whether or not this is true was irrelevant to them by this point, as they only wished to avoid more torture. They chose to tell humanity that they had finally won, in hope that it might become true. 
The lie was uncovered 4,500 years later, when Talenel returned to announce the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].

## Culture
According to Vorin tradition, mankind, led by the [[Herald\|Heralds]] and their chosen [[Knights Radiant\|knights]], fought off the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] ninety and nine times, until finally, Aharietiam came and the Voidbringers were cast back into the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]]. The Heralds followed to force them out of heaven as well, and Roshar's Heraldic Epochs ended. Songs and paintings depict the final conflict as a grand clash between lines of brave soldiers and giant monsters.

## Trivia
The name Aharietiam is based on the hebrew words אחרית הימים (*Acharit Hayamim*) meaning the end of days or the apocalypse.
