\-FM to Kauri[1]


**Dreamspring** is the capital city of the [[Kitsen\|kitsen]] planet, [[Evershore (planet)\|Evershore]]. Its full name is **The Burrow from Which Spring Dreams Both Sweet and Sorrowful**. The city has been the captial for at least several centuries and predates the disappearance of the kitsen [[Cytonics\|cytonics]]. It is built on an island like most kitsen cities. It is sheltered by tall sandstone cliffs, worn over time into fins and ridges. There‚Äôs a wide road leading from the beach to the main city, the road lined with small mound-shaped houses, some cut into the rock. They are often decorated with archways or flowers. Much of the city is built into the cliff, with many tunnels burrowed into the rock.
