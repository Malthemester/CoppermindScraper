**Miliv** was Citylord [[Wistiow\|Wistiow's]] head steward in [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Miliv disliked [[Lirin\|Lirin]], the local surgeon from Hearthstone, for unknown reasons. [[Lirin\|Lirin's]] son, Kaladin, believed that many of the rumors about their family in Hearthstone were started by Miliv.
Miliv was married to a woman who worked as a nurse to Brightlady [[Laral Wistiow\|Laral Wistiow]]. After Laral's father died, the nurse didn't let [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] visit Laral because she believed that the boys from the town were inappropriate friends for Laral.
Sometime after Citylord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] arrived to replace Wistiow, Miliv died and was replaced as steward by [[Natir\|Natir]].
