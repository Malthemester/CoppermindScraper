For a different Epic used in a squad against Larcener, see [[Fuego\|Fuego]].
**Puños de Fuego** (Spanish for **Fists of Fire**) is an [[Epic\|Epic]] based in Hermosillo, Mexico.
He has super strength and can lift practically anything, even things that ought to break apart as he does so. He has enhanced endurance and thick elephant-like skin, but is not a [[High Epic\|High Epic]]. He is killed in a hit by the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]]; though he avoids [[Sam (Reckoner)\|Sam]], somehow figures out where their operations station is, and breaks it open by throwing a tank through the wall, he is killed by [[Valentine\|Val]], who gets in the tank and shoots him with its main gun. Sam later finds his arm seven streets away.
This encounter seems to have gained some notoriety among Reckoners, as [[David\|David]] immediately asks Val if she was in the job in Hermosillo after learning she had been stationed in Mexico.
