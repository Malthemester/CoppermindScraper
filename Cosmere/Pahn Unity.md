The **Pahn Unity** was the coalition of nations that were united against Hallandren during the [[Manywar\|Manywar]]. It is possible many [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] joined in the Unity to oppose the Hallandren who had long occupied their land, hence the name of the coalition. It may have been referred to as a "unity" because the Pahn Kahl religion had five gods in a unity.
It may have included [[Gys\|Gys]], and almost surely included [[Tedradel\|Tedradel]].
The leader of the Pahn Unity was killed in the [[Battle of Twilight Falls\|Battle of Twilight Falls]].
