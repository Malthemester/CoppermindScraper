>“*Fiksin was a boot-licker, not a scholar.*”
\-Ellista on Fiksin.[1]

**Fiksin** is a scholar of [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
[[Urv\|Urv]] said Fiksin concluded that all Dawnchant books came from a central location, so [[Ellista\|Ellista's]] effort in recording where each text was found was not worthwhile. However, Ellista discarded that notion and insulted Fiksin, claiming Fiksin was not a true scholar. Then, she provided evidence that the Dawnchant writing system was used all across Roshar.
