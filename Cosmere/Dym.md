**Dym** is one of [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] elites.
He is present during the battle where they recruited [[Teleb\|Teleb]] and threw [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] a poleaxe after he lost his longsword during his battle with [[Yezriar\|Yezriar]]. Dalinar gives the poleaxe back to Dym while talking to a wounded soldier, and then gestures for Dym to end the soldiers suffering. When another soldier approaches with Dalinar's sword, Dym chides him for breaking it and asks if he's ok when Dalinar doesn't respond jovially.
