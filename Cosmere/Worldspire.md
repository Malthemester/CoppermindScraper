## Structure
It runs from the upper atmosphere down into the center of the planet, which is made of glass. It is a recreational activity to skydive off of it. It is located somewhere around the Kalmarian Wilds. There is a city built at the base of the Worldspire and wooden scaffolding going all the way to the top.

## Magical Effects
What happens to the spire is transferred to a random number of people, with different people each time. This can happen by tapping it, which causes a ringing sensation in the ears of some people, wind blowing on it, which can cause a cold chill, or striking the spire, which causes headaches.

## History
The previous fact is said by Alcatraz to be foreshadowing if the autobiography goes beyond [[The Dark Talent\|The Dark Talent]]. Apparently the events involving the Worldspire were hard to ignore, even in the [[Hushlands\|Hushlands]]. [[Attica Smedry\|Attica Smedry]] planned to use the Worldspire's properties to give the [[Smedry Talent\|Smedry Talents]] to the everyone in the world.
