**Triax** is a small nation in southern [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Geography and Ecology
The country lies in the southern part of central Roshar, between an unnamed mountain range and the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]]. It borders [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]] to the west and [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] to the east. A single river splits the country in two. There are no settlements of global importance there. However, its position at the edge of western and eastern Roshar lends it great strategic importance. For anybody seeking to cross the country to invade its neighbors, the northern mountains and the southern coast form a bottleneck that makes moving troops through it highly difficult.
The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] shows [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] the area around Triax and [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]] in a vision. Dalinar has little experience with Triax, and describes lush valleys with flora and fauna that look alien to him.

## History
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, the region was split in half between [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] and [[Valhav\|Valhav]]. At some point during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the area that would later become Triax was invaded by the Veden king [[NanHar\|NanHar]], although he died during the war and was succeeded by his brother, [[NanKhet\|NanKhet]]. As NanKhet died only three months later, giving way to a new dynasty, it's likely the Veden conquest never succeeded.
[[Vstim\|Vstim]] has purchased wormy grain in Triax at a large discount knowing that he could sell it for a profit in other lands.
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] struck at the strip of land bordering the Tarat Sea, including [[Marat\|Marat]] and Triax. Contact with the country, including its [[Spanreed\|spanreeds]], was lost mere weeks after the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], implying that it was one of the first states that fell to the enemy. Following the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Triax remained under control of [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. Dalinar and his coalition desired to recapture the area in order to reinforce their naval superiority in the south of the continent.
