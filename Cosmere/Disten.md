**Disten** is a member of [[Camon\|Camon's]] [[Camon's crew\|thieving crew]] in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He serves as a head pointman for the crew. He is missing one hand, but is considered to have very keen senses.

## History
After [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and [[Dockson\|Dockson]] intervened in the crew's attempt to scam the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]], Disten expressed curiosity about what Kelsier had discussed with [[Vin\|Vin]]. Disten and a few other crew members then recounted various rumors about Kelsier's history to Vin, mixing fact with fiction.
Disten was presumably killed when the Ministry discovered the crew's lair and slaughtered everyone inside.
