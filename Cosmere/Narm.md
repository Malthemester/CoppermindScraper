**Narm** is a member of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is skinnier than most of the other bridgemen. Narm is also one of the loudest complainers about [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]‚Äôs leadership, alongside [[Moash\|Moash]] and [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]].

## History
During his first run as bridgeleader, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] sought to find and heal the wounded bridgemen best he could. He asked Narm to make a fire, handing over his own shirt for tinder. Narm struggled to get the fire going while Kaladin worked on [[Gadol\|Gadol]]. Despite his efforts, Gadol died, but Kaladin yelled at Narm to keep the fire going and not to let it die in case others come. To his surprise, Narm actually got a small flame going which they used to treat other bridgemen.
When [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] is assigned chasm duty, Narm was working beside [[Moash\|Moash]] who was taunting Kaladin. Kaladin performed a kata which left them all, including Moash and Narm, stunned. Impressed with Kaladin, three-quarters of the bridgemen joined Kaladin for training in the morning, except for some of the loudest complainers including Narm.
Later, on a bridge run, Narm was injured alongside [[Peet\|Peet]]. It was a fraction of what other crews lost, but Kaladin argued that was still too many.
During the bridge run in which Kaladin first employed the carapace armor, the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] fell into formation, nocking some fifty arrows at Kaladin and the rest of Bridge Four. They are saved by the timely arrival of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] and his honor guard. After the close call, Kaladin sent Narm and [[Leyten\|Leyten]] to find good scouting points and watch the field for any Parshendi movement towards the chasm.
Narm was one of three casualties during the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], alongside [[Malop\|Malop]] and [[Earless Jaks\|Earless Jaks]]. He died trying to hold the bridge against the Parshendi while the Kholin army retreated.
