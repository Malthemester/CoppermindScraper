Arbiter **Frava** is the seniormost [[Arbiter\|arbiter]] and leader of the [[Heritage Faction\|Heritage Faction]] of the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. During the time of [[Ashravan\|Emperor Ashravan's]] reign, she was accounted the second most powerful person in the empire.

## Appearance and Personality
Frava has a sharp, nasal voice, long fingers, a long face, and moved with grace. She rarely smiled. She maintains a long standing rivalry with Gaotona, and has attempted to remove him from his position in the past. She is confrontational, manipulative, and tends to take the initiative.

## History
During the illness of [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]], Frava extorts [[Wan ShaiLu\|Wan ShaiLu]] into providing notes on the creation of the [[Soulstamp\|Soulstamp]] for her own Soulforgers to try and replicate. It is possible that Frava has connections with the underworld of the [[Imperial Seat\|Imperial Seat]], and enough influence to put people of her choosing in positions of influence among their ranks. She offered such a position to Shai, though it is suspected she did not intend to honor the deal.
Frava curates the [[Imperial Gallery\|Imperial Gallery]], and her offices are adjacent to it. She owns several notable pieces of artwork, one of which Shai replaces and destroys as a favour to [[Han ShuXen\|Han ShuXen]].
