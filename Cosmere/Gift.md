**Gift** is [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] and [[Tuaka\|Tuaka's]] eldest son, and twin brother of [[Cord\|Cord]]. The young boy is very tall and pale-skinned. He is [[Vorin\|Vorin]], and wears a [[Glyphward\|glyphward]] tied to his arm.
Like his father and sister, Gift may be able to [[Sighted\|see]] [[Spren\|spren]]. Gift is the only one of his siblings who speaks enough [[Alethi\|Alethi]] to manage a passable greeting.
Gift was converted to Vorinism, with his father's blessing, by [[Veden\|Veden]] monks who came to the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]]. He arrived at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] with his family in Jes 1174 after traveling for months to meet with Lunamor, who had sent them a message shortly after his arrival. Gift's caravan was attacked by [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] and his family barricaded themselves behind a pile of furniture. During the attack a member of his family shot a Voidbringer with an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrow. They were found by [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] during a patrol and taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Lunamor was surprised by how much Gift had grown during the time he was away. After settling in Urithiru, Gift helped his father serve food and drink to Bridge Four.
Along with his sister [[Cord\|Cord]], Gift stays with those at Urithiru, when Lunamor returns to the Peaks.
Gift likes [[Lift\|Lift]] and leaves food out for her to "steal".
