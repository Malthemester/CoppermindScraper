The **Kholins** are the ruling family of the kingdom of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. [[Kholin princedom\|Kholin princedom]] is their ancestral home, with [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] being their capital city.

## History
Like all Alethi princes, the Kholins are descended from the [[Sunmaker\|Sunmaker]] Sadees. The title of the Kholin Highprince has been held by 34 generations. However, they did not begun their expansion until around roughly 1139, when [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] Kholin led a conquest against the other [[Highprince\|Highprinces]] of Alethkar, eventually consolidating the whole nation into a kingdom in the year 1148.  
Gavilar Kholin took the Alethi crown, and married [[Navani\|Navani]], siring [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] and [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]], while Dalinar, as his younger brother, married [[Evi\|Evi]] and had [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Renarin\|Renarin]] with her. Following Gavilar's [[Szeth\|assassination]] in 1167, Elhokar, as the sole male heir, succeeded the throne. Some time before his father's death, he had married [[Aesudan\|Aesudan]] and had a single son, [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]] in the early years of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]].
In 1173, during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Navani attempted to court Dalinar, picking up their mutual interest in each other from their younger days, that had only been allowed to lapse because Dalinar had stepped aside in favour of Gavilar. Their courtship was frowned upon by the [[Ardentia\|ardentia]] but nevertheless maintained and culminated in them being married in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] by the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]], as no ardent was willing to perform the rites. Afterwards, Dalinar was titled a highking, giving up his claim to the princedom and making Adolin the Kholin highprince.
The [[Siege of Kholinar\|siege of Kholinar]] claimed the life of Elhokar at the hands of [[Moash\|Moash]], but his child and heir, [[Gavinor\|Gavinor]], was rescued by [[Skar\|Skar]] and [[Drehy\|Drehy]]. Around the time of Elhokar's death, his wife perished as well, being consumed by the power of [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]], with whom she had entered a bond shortly before and proved unable to control the overwhelming power of the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] within her.
After the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|battle of Thaylen Field]] Dalinar asked Adolin to be king, but as he did not believe himself to be capable, Jasnah was crowned queen instead.
When [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] becomes Jasnah's ward, in order to protect Shallan's family from their creditors and political adversaries, Jasnah orchestrates a causal betrothal between her ward and Adolin. This eventually culminated in their marriage after the battle of Thaylen Field.
