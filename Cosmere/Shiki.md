**Shiki** is an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] drink on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Characteristics
It is brown in color, and mixed in large metal bins and chilled overnight. It is served cold from a large pot or cauldron.

## History
[[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] once tried making shiki for [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]]. Bridge Four mostly declined to drink the shiki, choosing to drink beer instead.
During a training session in [[Narak\|Narak]], Lunamor tried making the drink again. [[Huio\|Huio]] added some [[Lazbo\|lazbo]] to a batch, annoying Lunamor. However, Lunamor was surprised to find that the spices complemented the drink perfectly, and it became a very tasty drink. He had the members of Bridge Four try the shiki again and this time they loved it, partly because it was so refreshing after they had exerted themselves during the training.
