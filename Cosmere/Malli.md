**Malli** is a scribe on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is married to a [[Scadrial\|Scadrian]] [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]] named [[Felt\|Felt]]. Malli's own origins are not known, and it is not clear if she shares (or is even aware of) Felt's abilities.

## Attributes and Abilities
She is able to use a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] and write in [[Women's script\|women's script]]. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Adolin\|Adolin]] both trust her, as she is assigned to be the primary scribe on at least two important journeys, including one that required significant discretion.

## History
In approximately 1169, Malli and Felt accompanied [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] on his expedition to [[The Valley\|the Valley]] to visit the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. She was part of a small group that traveled from their ship to the Valley, serving as its scribe. She was present in Dalinar's stormwagon when he exited the Valley; she sent a message via [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] to the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] ship that he had returned. Dalinar also asked Malli to tell the sailors to find him a copy of *The Way of Kings* in the port, so he could hear it read to him again after having [[Evi\|Evi]] erased from his memory.
Malli and Felt moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] at some point after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. In 1175, they were selected as members of the diplomatic mission to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. Malli, who was working in the quartermaster's office, again served as the mission's scribe. She traveled with the team through Shadesmar, sometimes looking after [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]] on Adolin's behalf. She was one of the few members of the team that remained in camp outside of Lasting Integrity during Adolin's trial.
