## Appearance and Personality
He has the characteristic dark skin and hair of the [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] people. He is taller than his cousin [[Baxil\|Baxil]].
Av is a confident man who gets mildly annoyed by his jumpy, timid cousin. He carries a large sword in a sheath slung over his shoulder. He is somewhat surly, and maintains a nonchalant attitude in stressful situations.

## Attributes and Abilities
Av is presumably a relatively skilled thief, since Shalash was willing to hire him. Their small team is able to avoid detection even in heavily guarded buildings. He likely has some experience with swordfighting.

## History
Av and Baxil were hired by [[Shalash\|Shalash]] to assist her in infiltrating homes and palaces with the goal of destroying artwork, particularly artwork that depicted her. They were not aware of her true identity and simply referred to her as "mistress"; they noticed that she did not seem to fit in with typical Rosharan ethnicities, and Av assumed that she was of mixed heritage. Baxil was infatuated with her, but Av simply saw her as a well-paying, if dangerous, employer.
During the break-ins, Shalash prohibited Baxil and Av from stealing anything. Av primarily served as a lookout and a guard while Baxil assisted Shalash as she performed acts of vandalism. Av and Baxil helped Shalash break into the palace of [[Ashno\|Ashno of Sages]], who was said to be one of the richest and holiest men in Emul. The pair may have also been present during Shalash's destruction of artwork in other places, such as the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] and [[Gavilar\|King Gavilar's]] palace in Kholinar.
Av was knowledgeable regarding the boons and curses of the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. His parents and several brothers had all visited the [[Valley\|Valley]]. Av told Baxil that the Nightwatcher did not try to trick you or twist your words, despite rumors to that effect. She simply used the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]] to give you the boon that she felt you deserved, accompanied by a curse that could not be predicted. His family had generally regretted their visits, except his father. His father's boon had been valuable cloth that allowed the family to survive a [[Lurnip\|lurnip]] famine; his curse was viewing the world upside-down, but he was able to get used to it. Based on his family's experiences, Av did not plan to visit the Valley himself.
