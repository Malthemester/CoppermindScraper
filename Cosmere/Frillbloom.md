**Frillbloom** is a family of plants native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is common in the chasms of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], and grows larger there than it does in other places.
Frillbloom leaves are fanlike fronds that wave gently in the air. When startled, they fold in on themselves like a hand folding into a fist. They also close up when a storm is approaching.
Colors vary between different frillbloom species, and include yellow, orange, red, and violet. In some varieties, the fronds are veined. Other varieties have spines on the tips of the leaves.
