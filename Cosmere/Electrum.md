**Electrum** is the internal temporal pushing metal alloy made from gold and silver. An Allomancer burning electrum is able to see possible futures of oneself, up to several seconds. Feruchemists can use electrum to store determination, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, electrum steals Enhancement Allomantic powers.

## Alloy Composition
The electrum used in the Metallic Arts is forty-five percent gold, fifty-five percent silver.

## Allomantic Use
A electrum [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as an **Oracle**. Burning electrum will reveal possible futures of the Oracle up to several seconds, by casting shadows of oneself like [[Atium\|atium]] shadows. One use of electrum is its ability to counter [[Atium\|atium]], in this regard and the fact that gold and silver are relatively cheap compared to atium. [[Elend\|Elend]] called it "poor man's atium".
While burning electrum the Oracle's future will not be revealed to enemy Allomancers burning atium. Instead, it will cause the Oracle's observed atium shadow to split, preventing the enemy Allomancer from predicting one's actions.
If burned with [[Duralumin\|duralumin]], it would likely have a similar effect to atium, in that the user would be able to see into the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]].

## Feruchemical Use
An electrum [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Pinnacle**. Electrum is used to store determination. A Pinnacle filling an electrummind will become depressed, and can tap it later to enter a manic state.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, electrum steals Enhancement Allomantic powers ([[Chromium\|chromium]], [[Nicrosil\|nicrosil]], [[Aluminum\|aluminum]], and [[Duralumin\|duralumin]]).

## History
The [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] hid electrum from public knowledge since it would completely destroy the value of atium and the system of atium economy. Vin later found descriptions of this metal on a metal plate in the [[Urteau\|Urteau]] [[Storage cavern\|storage cavern]].

## Trivia
Brandon made a mistake while writing [[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]]. The Feruchemical effects of [[Brass\|brass]] and electrum were to be swapped. By the time he realized this was forgotten, however, the book was already in print. Brandon didn't want to retcon this, so the effect of electrum was canonized.
