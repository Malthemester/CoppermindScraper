**Ten** is one of [[House Davar\|House Davar's]] guards in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] prior to [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar's]] association with the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]].
Ten had worked for the Davars for a number of years, but by 1172, [[Luesh\|Luesh]] had taken over as house steward and purged all of Lin's old guardsmen. [[Balat Davar\|Balat Davar]] compared the old guards such as [[Beal\|Beal]] and Ten with the newer, more violent guards including [[Levrin\|Levrin]] and [[Rin\|Rin]]. Balat remarked that Beal and Ten were friendly and liked to joke around.
