**Melu** is a [[Listener\|listener]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
Melu was one of the first volunteers to try to take on warform after [[Venli\|Venli]] successfully petitioned [[The Five\|the Five]] for permission. She and a dozen others were successful in adopting the new form; immediately after the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], the group heard battle drums announcing an attack on their family's city. Melu was excited at the prospect of a conflict and wanted to take the family's set of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and their [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] from [[Sharefel\|Sharefel]]. [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] stopped her and instead resolved the conflict with the opposing family by a show of strength that convinced them they could not win. Melu and the others headed back to the city to train in their new forms. She expressed some irritation that she hadn't had an opportunity to show off her newfound strength but did agree that Eshonai's peaceful resolution had been better.
After the listeners unified and moved to [[Narak\|Narak]], Melu gained some level of command among the army. She helped Venli and Eshonai count the listener population, troops and civilians alike, requiring each to adopt stormform. Like the rest of the listener stormforms, she likely then participated in the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. Melu survived the battle to later be possessed by the [[Fused\|Fused]] [[Aharat\|Aharat]], effectively killing her. Just prior to her death, she questioned [[Ulim\|Ulim]] if the group of singers following [[Venli\|Venli]] should seek shelter from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] which brought the Fused.
