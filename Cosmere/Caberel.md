Lieutenant **Caberel** is a member of the [[Elendel\|Elendel]] constabulary on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is stout. She rolls her eyes at [[Claude Aradel\|Claude Aradel's]] micromanaging, but [[Marasi\|Marasi]] believes that Caberel is fond of him. She is not particularly principled.

## History
Caberel worked in the Fourth Octant precinct offices under Constable-General Aradel. Caberel was one of a small number of female constables, and one of the few people who treated Marasi with respect.
Aradel told her that increased constabulary presence was needed at pubs during the night due to striking workers congregating nearby, and Caberel agreed to increase patrols.
Caberel was present during the interrogation of [[Rian\|Rian]] after the attempted assassination of [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate]]. She tried to determine whether Rian could be connected to the murder of [[Winsting Innate\|Winsting Innate]]. Since Rian was not
cooperating, Caberel suggested coercing information from him through physical violence or by threatening his daughter; Marasi was forced to remind her that such tactics were illegal.
