**Granite Joe** was a [[Koloss\|koloss-blooded]] criminal in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
He had many people in the roughs in his pay, making him extremely dangerous to hunt. He told Wax that he and other lawmen should leave the Roughs, as the whole point of the Roughs is to get away from the laws of [[Elendel\|Elendel]].

>“*We came here to escape folks like you. Your rules. Your assumptions. We don’t want you.*”
\-Granite Joe to Wax during their standoff


During his first year in the Roughs [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] hunted him for killing somebody's son. Joe had discovered that Wax was [[Allomancer\|metalborn]] and laid an ambush in [[Weathering\|Weathering's]] saloon. During a standoff with Wax in the basement of the bar he was killed by [[Lessie\|Lessie]] with a crossbow, believing her to be on his side after paying her off.
