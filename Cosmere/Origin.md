The **Origin of Storms**, often referred to as simply the **Origin**, is an area on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] where [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] are thought to be formed. Although it has never been reliably documented, it's believed to exist far to the east of the planet's main landmass, possibly in or across the [[Ocean of Origins\|Ocean of Origins]].

## Significance
As the presumptive source of highstorms, the Origin is hugely important to Rosharans. The nature of the flora and fauna on Roshar is heavily influenced by local climates that are dominated by the storms, which are strongest in the east where they make landfall. Many buildings, particularly those in eastern Roshar, have features such as doors, balconies, patios, and gardens facing away from the Origin, so as to protect them from storm winds and debris. In contrast, the tower-city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] has a tall column of windows directly facing the Origin, possible only because it's located above the storms.
Several of Roshar's major [[Spren\|spren]] are connected to the Origin. When not in a highstorm, [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] feels the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather's]] presence in that direction. [[Cusicesh\|Cusicesh]] forms a face and looks towards the Origin every day at seven forty-six in the morning.

## Legends
There is some disagreement on Roshar as to the Origin's true nature. While ancient myths state that every [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] begins there, modern [[Stormwarden\|stormwardens]] believe that a single highstorm continuously circles the planet. However, the term "Origin of Storms" is used by both humans and [[Listener\|listeners]], and the belief that the storms originate there is still widely held. According to [[Lirin\|Lirin]], there have been a few attempts to sail east to the Origin, but of all the ships to set out for it, none have ever returned.
A [[Natan\|Natan]] named [[Puuli\|Puuli]] and his grandfather believe that there are people living on a hidden island at the Origin. Per their story, those people, once sailors who were lost while sailing the Ocean of Origins, are to return with "Light in their pockets" and restore the fallen kingdom of [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]].
Additionally, some stories suggest that there may be an "origin" that can be reached by sailing west from the Rosharan continent. One such myth is *Derethil and the Wandersail*. In the story, King Derethil, sailing far to the west in hopes of finding the source of the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]], finds a whirlpool where the ocean drains, likely known as the "Great Abyss". The whirlpool was ringed by islands populated by the [[Uvara\|Uvara]] people. Derethil is said to have escaped the islands with an Uvara named [[Nafti\|Nafti]], but nothing more is known of their story.
Although the historicity of these stories and legends are unclear, it is geographically feasible that the same place could be reached by sailing in either direction from the main continent, as Roshar has no other large landmasses.
