**Toorim** was a soldier in [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He was a member of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] squad.
Toorim searched the brightlord that Kaladin killed for spheres, but did not find any. Toorim thought the brightlord either brought no spheres or they were hidden under his breastplate. Stealing from the dead was prohibited, but Kaladin did not mind Toorim searching for the spheres.
Toorim also alerted Kaladin to an unknown [[Veden\|Veden]] [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]], which killed him, along with [[Acis\|Acis]], [[Hamel\|Hamel]], [[Raksha\|Raksha]], [[Navar\|Navar]] and eleven other members of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] squad. It was later discovered by [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] by identification of his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], in the current possession of [[Amaram\|Amaram]], that the Veden Shardbearer was [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]].
