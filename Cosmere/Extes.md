**Extes** is a man from [[Vorin\|Vorin]] mythology on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
According to the myth, Extes sacrificed his son to the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] in exchange for knowledge about the day of his death. He was punished by being made immortal, and then having his arms torn off every day. This tale was well-known in Alethkar, often told among the [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]].
His story was one of many involving men made immortal and then tortured for eternity. This is potentially related to the [[Herald\|Heralds]], who were immortal and tortured in [[Damnation\|Damnation]] after every [[Desolation\|Desolation]].
