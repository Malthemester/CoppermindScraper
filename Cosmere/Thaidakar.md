>“*We will need to find how much he knows. You will bring these pages to Master Thaidakar. We are close, but so--it appears--are Restares's cronies.*”
\-Mraize upon receiving information about Amaram and the Sons of Honor's plans[1]


**Thaidakar** is a leader of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], sometimes referred to as Master Thaidakar by Ghostbloods. Thaidakar, along with the Ghostbloods, is often mentioned opposing the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]].
As [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]]--a prominent [[Sons of Honor\|Son of Honor]]--lay dying, he told [[Szeth\|Szeth]] to "tell Thaidakar he was too late."
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] killed [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]] in [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army, Amaram--another Son of Honor--thought Thaidakar and the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] were behind the attack, saying the Ghostbloods were growing more bold.
Prior to the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] brought [[Mraize\|Mraize]] pages that transcribed text from Amaram's room discussing the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] and the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Then, Shallan overheard Mraize saying that they should bring these pages to Master Thaidakar, and that [[Restares\|Restares's]] cronies--the Sons of Honor--were also growing close to the answers of the Shattered Plains.
[[Ialai\|Ialai's]] notebook mentioned that, like "Mraize", it seemed to be a title rather than a name.
