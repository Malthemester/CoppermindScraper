The **Battle of Teoras** took place on the planet of [[Sel\|Sel]] just before [[Raoden\|Raoden]] and [[Sarene\|Sarene]] were crowned king and queen of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]].
King [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]] of [[Teod\|Teod]], faced with the death of his daughter Sarene, capitulates to the demands of [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] and agrees to the full surrender of Teod to the armies of the [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] Empire.
Dilaf, [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] and Sarene are transported to Eventeo's throne room by the sacrifice of some of his monks. Hrathen and Sarene escape, and are pursued through the city by Dilaf.
Raoden arrives in Teoras and is nearly defeated by Dilaf, until Hrathen uses Dilaf's own magic against him.
The rest of the Elantrians arrive and battle the troops of Fjordell. Then they all jump back to Elantris.
