**Lamentation Winebare** is a horse thief in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].

## Appearance & Personality
Lamentation has a long and slender neck and a potato-shaped head.
He speaks with a [[Lastport\|Lastport]] accent, and is a very jumpy, sweaty, and nervous person, most likely due to his past crimes as a horse thief.

## History
At some point in the past, Lamentation steals some horses, earning him a tiny bounty of two measures of silver.
Later, under the name of Earnest, he speaks to [[Daggon\|Daggon]] in [[Silence\|Silence's]] [[Silence's waystop\|waystop]] about the [[White Fox\|White Fox]]. Lamentation buys Daggon drinks to get him to tell stories about the White Fox, such as how he caught [[Makepeace Hapshire\|Makepeace Hapshire]]. Daggon assures him that the White Fox would not go after such a petty criminal as Lamentation.
Some time after Silence's capture of [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]], Lamentation takes work on a homestead. However, he pays to spend each night in Silence's waystop because he cannot get used to how the homesteaders allow shades to float around the homestead, and even inside the buildings.
Lamentation has a cousin who claims to have seen the [[Shade\|shade]] of Silence's husband guarding her waystop.
