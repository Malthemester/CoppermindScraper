The Pinnacle stands on a hill above all the other warcamps, about an hour's march from the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] warcamp. It is surrounded by a sheer drop of approximately a hundred feet. One road leads to the main entrance, while a smaller side route goes down to the stables at the feet of the hill. Likewise, the [[Feasting basin\|feasting basin]] sits beneath the palace, with a short climb between it and the Pinnacle gates. The [[Outer Market\|Outer Market]] is also located nearby.
The palace is made of sculpted, [[Soulcasting\|Soulcast]] stone. A broad gateway leads inside, though there is also a back entrance atop a flight of steps. Within, the Pinnacle has several floors containing vast, cavernous halls, and numerous rooms serving a variety of purposes. A large part of it is dug straight into the hill, with windows cut out facing leeward. There are shutters on the windows to keep them closed during bad weather, though they tend to rattle and leak.

### Notable rooms




## History
The palace was constructed by the royal [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. Elhokar eventually dubbed it the Pinnacle, and the name stuck.
During its existence, the place served as Elhokar's home, as well as the place where strategy and planning meetings were conducted, making it effectively the centre of [[Alethi\|Alethi]] government. In addition, the Pinnacle saw several failed attempts to assassinate the king - once by the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]], through a sliced railing in the royal quarters, once by the [[Assassin in White\|Assassin in White]], and once directly by [[Moash\|Moash]] and [[Graves\|Graves]]. Following that last attempt, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] temporarily relocated Elhokar to [[Little Herdaz\|Little Herdaz]].
After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], most Alethi relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. As with the other structures on the Shattered Plains, the Pinnacle was all but abandoned.
