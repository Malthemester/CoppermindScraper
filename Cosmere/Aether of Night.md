## Plot
It follows a character named Raeth as he pretends to be his identical twin, taking over the throne of the Imperium and attempting to lead his people to victory against a foe they don't understand and have little hope of defeating. "Aether" was a term used as part of the magic system.

## Publication History
### Original Version
The original version of the book was abandoned, as Brandon felt that it didn't strike a consistent tone between the almost Shakespearean comedy aspects and the utter destruction of the world. As a result, elements were incorporated into later works, such as "Decay" becoming the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Ruin\|Ruin]] in the [[Mistborn series\|Mistborn series]]. An attempt was also made to adapt the aethers into *The Liar of Partinel*, but that was abandoned. Brandon has also mentioned incorporating a character named Darro into a potential *Warbreaker* sequel named *Nightblood*.
Since the draft version of *Aether of Night* is unlikely to ever be published, Brandon's team used to send a copy to people who requested it via email, provided that they agreed to not share it or discuss it on public forums. As of July 2017, Brandon gave the file to the  to distribute. They will send out the file after it is requested; however, the wait can still be several weeks due to high demand.

### Potential Rewrite
It remains possible that the book will be published in some form, but it would be a complete rewrite. Brandon has mentioned that the general mechanics of the magic system would be retained. A substance called "[[Aether\|aether]]" appeared in *Oathbringer*, leaving the door open for the story to take place in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], and Brandon continues to list it as a cosmere work in his annual [[State of the Sanderson\|State of the Sanderson]] posts. However, it is not high on the priority list since the story would fall outside of the "main" cosmere series.
