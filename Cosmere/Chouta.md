## Ingredients
The flatbread used in chouta is very thick. The meat often used in the warcamps is [[Flangria\|flangria]], which is mixed with ground [[Lavis\|lavis]], formed into small balls, battered and fried. The meatballs are then stuffed into the fried bread and covered with a generous amount of dark gravy. The chouta stands in [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] warcamp also sell a variety that is stuffed with fried [[Cremling\|cremling]] claws instead of meatballs, and there may be other variations. Chouta is flavorful, but not spicy.

## History
[[Lopen\|Lopen]] introduced [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] to chouta in the warcamps. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] initially thought it looked disgusting, but [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] and [[Rock\|Rock]] tried it and enjoyed it. Kaladin eventually broke down and bought some chouta from a street vendor; he was annoyed to discover that he actually liked it. The love of chouta spread throughout Bridge Four, and [[Teft\|Teft]], [[Skar\|Skar]], [[Leyten\|Leyten]], and [[Drehy\|Drehy]] were all later seen eating it.
Chouta was sold at a tavern in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] visited by [[Hoid\|Hoid]] and [[Shallan\|Shallan]]. It was also commonly eaten in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].

## Trivia
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] has noted that chouta are not inspired by burritos and are closer to "deep-fried meatballs in a ". Brandon is fascinated by the rapid development of portable street food during the industrial revolution, and devised chouta to reflect this concept.
