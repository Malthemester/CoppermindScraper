**Wulfden the First** is a former [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] of the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].
Wulfden the First lived over three hundred years before the [[Reod\|Reod]], during the First Empire of Fjorden. The empire had conquered almost all of [[Opelon\|Opelon]] through military might, but collapsed due to its rapid expansion.
Fjorden originally had a pantheistic religion, but after the collapse, Wulfden converted to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and made it the state religion of [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]], elevating [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] from a minor god to a primary deity. Early Derethi leadership, presumably under Wulfden's guidance, also instituted the system of propaganda that led their priests to alter historical works such as *Wyrn the King*.
Within a generation, all of Fjorden was Derethi, and the militaristic structure of their society was adapted to an aggressive policy of religious conversion of neighboring states. The resulting [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]], also known as the "New Empire", eventually gained more power than the First Empire had once held.

## Trivia
"Wulfden" is a name used by several Fjordell Wyrns, including the current ruler, [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]]. However, there is no confirmed familial relationship between these leaders.
