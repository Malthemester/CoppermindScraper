**Maria** is the IRL/[[Snapshot (event)\|Snapshot]] liaison officer who texts with [[Chaz\|Chaz]] and [[Anthony Davis\|Davis]] while they are in the Snapshot. Chaz and Davis talk to Maria in the back of the 42nd precinct, where the snapshot teams and Maria work, to get the information they don't want to ask IRL Maria. When threatening Snapshot Maria for information, Chaz gets frustrated and then shoots and kills her.

## Appearance & Personality
Maria is described as a prim woman in her early fifties, with dyed black hair, and wears glasses that she stubbornly keeps by refusing to get any corrective surgery. Davis says that she has never and wouldn't ever lie to him but has held back the truth on multiple occasions. Chaz describes her as a hottie.
