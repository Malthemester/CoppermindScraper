**Jedal** is a [[Skaa\|skaa]] miner from the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is the father of [[Spook\|Spook]].

## Appearance and Personality
Jedal is a large man, often covered with dust and dirt because of his job as a miner. He is cruel and brutal, not hesitating to kill his own son after learning of his [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]].

## History
Jedal lived in a crowded skaa shack in the Eastern Dominance with his wife, [[Margel\|Margel]]. They had at least one son, also named Jedal, but later called Lestibournes and Spook. Jedal did not approve of Spook running around in the streets and was annoyed by his use of [[High Imperial\|eastern street slang]].
Allomancy ran in Margel's family, and Spook [[Snapping\|Snapped]] when he was only five years old. Margel presumably soon discovered that he was a tin [[Misting\|Misting]] and sent for her brother, [[Clubs\|Clubs]], hoping that he could protect the boy from execution by the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]]. However, Jedal and some other skaa soon learned of Spook's secret and tracked him down. Fearing further retribution from the Steel Ministry, Jedal decided to kill Spook himself to keep his powers a secret. Before he could, Clubs intervened, trading a bag of coins to Jedal for Spook's life. Jedal was angry that Margel had contacted her brother behind his back, but took the deal. He seemingly kept his word and did not betray Clubs to the Steel Ministry after he left with Spook.
