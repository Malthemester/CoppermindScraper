**Tedradel** is a kingdom on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] that has existed from before the time of the [[Manywar\|Manywar]]. It is located across the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]] from Hallandren.

## History
Tedradel opposed [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] in the Manywar, possibly as part of the [[Pahn Unity\|Pahn Unity]]. When [[Vasher\|Vasher]] withdrew [[Kalad's Phantoms\|Kalad's Phantoms]], it was brought out of the conflict along with the rest of the surviving kingdoms. However, since the Manywar, Tedradel's hatred and animosity towards Hallandren has not lessened greatly. Tedradel was on good enough terms with [[Idris\|Idris]] that it was considered possible by General [[Yarda\|Yarda]] that Tedradel would come to their aid if a conflict erupted between Idris and Hallandren.

## Culture
The people of Tedradel have brown skin, and traders from there often wear long black beards tied into a cylindrical shape with a leather cord. Tedradel is still on good enough relations with Hallandren by the time of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]] that it had traders in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]].
[[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] wears a dress in a fashion from Tedradel that is tube-like and tightly fitted. It is a long dress, going from her ankle almost to her neck, with full-length sleeves.
It is possible that they also export fine pottery, as some is to be found in Hallandren that comes from across the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]], where Tedradel was located.
