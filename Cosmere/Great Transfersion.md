>‚Äú* Later that night, he performed the Great Transfersion, an awesome display of power by which he transformed most of Chicago -- buildings, vehicles, streets -- into steel. That included a large portion of Lake Michigan, which became a glassy expanse of black metal. It was there that he built his palace.*‚Äù

The **Great Transfersion**, or the **Day of Annexation**, was an act performed by [[Steelheart (Epic)\|Steelheart]] near the beginning of his reign in [[Newcago\|Newcago]], presumably as part of his ploy to make as many people fear him as possible and thereby prevent his weakness from being used against him. In the grand display of his [[Epic\|Epic]] powers, Steelheart transformed a massive area into solid steel, including most of the old city of Chicago, a large portion of Lake Michigan, and the earth hundreds of feet underneath. During the early years of his reign, Steelheart made his [[Diggers\|Diggers]] carve out several levels of [[Understreets\|understreets]] in the steel.
Steelheart's transfersion ability, while very powerful, has some limitations. The effect radiates out from him like sound waves, transforming anything it touches into steel; however, anything already made of metal, especially steel or iron, reduces the effect of the power, and a sufficient amount can stop it entirely. As a result, the contents of the bank vault of the [[First Union Bank (Newcago)\|First Union Bank]] were mostly protected; the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] eventually reach the vault and go through its contents while looking for clues to Steelheart's weakness. Living beings are also entirely unaffected by Steelheart's transfersion, as is anything very close to a living being.
