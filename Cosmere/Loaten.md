When [[Khriss\|Khriss]] came to Lonzare [[N'Teese\|N'Teese]], for a fee, brought her to see Loaten. He recognized her as the "missing [[Elis\|Elisian]] Duchess". When Khriss asked him for information about what Gevin was searching for and about his fate, but Loaten refused to give her more than hints, saying that he is not allowed to tell her.

As Khriss left the room [[Baon\|Baon]] saw Loaten through the doorway, recognized him as a traitor, and raised his pistol to shoot him before Khriss pacified him and they made a hasty exit.
