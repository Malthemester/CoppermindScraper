## History
The nation was subsumed into the Empire many years previous to [[Ashravan\|Emperor Ashravan's]] reign, and the use of its name was rare in contemporary usage. The people of Mulla'dil were well regarded by the [[Grand\|Grands]], although they renamed them Strikers after the Empire annexed their territory. It was not uncommon for Strikers to be Elevated. Strikers were often employed as guards or soldiers by the Empire, although some of them would have preferred a different profession. Strikers employed at the [[Rose Palace\|Rose Palace]] were required to be literate.

## Physical Traits
Mulla'dil people are generally tall and pale-skinned, with dark, curly hair. They are usually lean and athletic, and some individuals can be described as "brawny".

## Culture
Although Mulla'dil was folded into the Empire, its people still maintain a cultural identity, including the ongoing use of the Mulla'dil language. The former nation bordered the swamps of [[Dzhamar\|Dzhamar]] and there was a deep-seated hatred between the Strikers and their neighbors. There is still significant tension caused by the Dzhamarian practice of [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]], which the Strikers consider to be revolting and unnatural. The antagonism between the two nations may exceed their loyalty to the Empire.
