\-Silence's grandfather to Silence Montane[1]


**Silence's grandfather** is a man from the [[Homeland\|Homeland]] that travels to the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].

## Personality
In contrast to the personality of his wife, Silence's grandfather seems to be a kindly man. He taught Silence woodcraft and clearly took good care of her, telling her stories of the [[Fallen World\|Fallen World]]. She remembers him with fondness. He is also clearly a brave man, willing to set foot on an unknown continent and live there. Silence's grandfather had a great love and respect for the Forests of Hell as well. He says that they are like a dangerous beast, not evil but to be treated with care.

## History
He and his wife, [[Silence's grandmother\|Silence's grandmother]], are among the first to come to the continent containing the Forests of Hell, so they take the surname [[Forescout\|Forescout]]. After the Homeland falls when the [[Evil\|Evil]] comes, he and his wife run a [[Silence's waystop\|waystop]]
Silence's grandparents have at least one child of unknown gender. That child has a daughter, [[Silence Montane\|Silence]]. It is unknown what happens to Silence's parents, but Silence is raised by her grandparents. Silence's grandfather taught her how to move carefully and quietly in the Forests without attracting the attention of the [[Shade\|shades]] or other humans.
Silence's grandfather met his end in the Forests somehow, likely due to the shades. His death has a profound impact on his wife, who never smiles again afterward.
