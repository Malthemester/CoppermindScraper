He attended a ball at [[Keep Hasting\|Keep Hasting]] as the date of Lady [[Kliss\|Kliss]]. He had difficulty following Kliss's theory about why [[House Geffenry\|House Geffenry]] may have killed [[Charrs Entrone\|Charrs Entrone]], and Kliss spoke to him patronizingly on the subject.
Rene asked [[Milen Davenpleu\|Milen Davenpleu]] to join him in a game of [[Shelldry\|shelldry]] with Lord [[Tyden\|Tyden]] the day after the ball even though Milen had failed to show up to a previous game. Milen had an [[Obligator\|obligator]] witness his promise to join them this time.
