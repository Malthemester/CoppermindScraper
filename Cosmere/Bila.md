## History
During the time when the listeners only had three forms to choose from, [[Thude\|Thude]] asked Bila to take [[Mateform\|mateform]] with him, and she agreed.
Later, during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], [[Venli\|Venli]] brought to the [[Council of Five\|Council of Five]] a [[Gemstone\|gemstone]] containing a captured [[Stormspren\|stormspren]]. [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] then showed it to Thude and Bila, the latter of whom was skeptical and did not care about it unless it could help her to kill the [[Alethi\|Alethi]]. When Eshonai chastised her for her lack of concern over the connection between the ancient powers and their old gods, Bila almost reached the point of insubordination before Thude intervened by offering food.
When the time came for the listeners to take the new [[Stormform\|form]], Bila and all of the rest of the soldiers agreed to do so. However, Thude expressed reservations to Eshonai about the way she was seizing control of the listeners. She gave permission to Thude to guard the group of dissenters, so he gathered Bila and the rest of Eshonai's old division to take charge of them. Not long after they took command of the dissenters, though, the whole group escaped into the chasms and fled [[Narak\|Narak]].

## Relationships
### Thude
Bila and [[Thude\|Thude]] enjoy a close relationship because of the two week time period they spend together in [[Mateform\|mateform]]; after that, they also fight as a warpair while in [[Warform\|warform]]. Although Bila is at first a proponent of [[Stormform\|stormform]], she presumably agrees with Thude in the end about the form's dangers and agrees to flee Narak with the group of those who refuse to take a form of power.

### Eshonai
When [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] shows Bila the captured stormspren, she notes that Bila does not care about her people's origins or the origin of the power this new form promises; she is focused only on the war with the Alethi. This frightens Eshonai, who knows there are others who think the same way, discounting the danger of the solution in the face of the immediate threat posed by the humans.
