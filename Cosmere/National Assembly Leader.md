**National Assembly Leaders**, or **NALs**, are members of the National Assembly, the governing body of the [[Defiant League\|Defiant League]] on [[Detritus\|Detritus]].
The National Assembly Leaders are usually highly influential and merited citizens of Detritus' lower caverns. They have vast authority over the [[DDF\|DDF]] matters. They observe their entry tests, have access to classified data and can directly interfere with DDF's functioning, including staffing decisions. [[Judy Ivans\|Judy Ivans]] answers directly to them, though they usually interact with her through their underlings.
The National Assembly Leaders are often descended from the mutineers in the fleet that brought people to Detritus. Ivans speculates that this might be why many of them push against acknowledging the "[[Cytonics\|defect]]".
