**Initiation** is the process by which a person is chosen to gain the ability to access a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] (and/or the process of actually gaining such access). [[Vessel\|Vessels]] can choose to alter how Initiation for their Shard's magic works to some extent, subject to some limitations determined by the underlying mechanics. The method of Initiation varies between different manifestations, but there are [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]-wide principles underlying the different methods: in order for a person to be Initiated, it is generally necessary for their soul to have some degree of "damage", creating cracks in their [[Spiritweb\|Spiritweb]] that Investiture can rush into and fill, thereby linking them to the magic. Some magic systems make it much easier than others to achieve this.

## Scadrial
The method of Initiation for [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] is known as [[Snapping\|Snapping]]. A [[Scadrian\|Scadrian's]] potential for Allomancy is set at birth according to their [[Physical Realm\|Physical]], [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]], and [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] aspects; sufficient trauma during life (or even during birth itself) can then provide the necessary damage to the soul to release this latent potential. A large part of the potential is determined genetically, and Allomancy is known in-universe to run through family lines.
After [[Sazed\|Sazed]] [[Catacendre\|Ascends]], creating the new Shard [[Harmony\|Harmony]], he becomes bothered by how Snapping works and alters it somehow, making it much easier to reach the necessary threshold of Spiritual damage; however, he is unable to remove the need for the process entirely.
Initiation for [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] also has a genetic component; whether it has any further requirements analogous to Snapping is unknown.

## Roshar
[[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] differs from Snapping in that the determination of who is granted access is made on a case-by-case basis by conscious entities (the [[Spren\|spren]] of the [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]]) depending on the behavior of the person. They are looking for people with broken spirits, as with Snapping, but each kind of spren also applies to its own specific requirements. Also, perhaps uniquely among magic users, Surgebinders gain access to additional power by swearing [[Immortal Words\|oaths]], and can lose power or break the bond entirely by violating their oaths or acting contrary to their spirit.

## Nalthis
The [[Returned\|Returned]] are individually chosen by [[Endowment\|Endowment]]; after a [[Nalthian\|Nalthian]] dies, she may choose to grant them a [[Divine Breath\|Divine Breath]], bringing them back as a Returned. She is looking for "certain things" when choosing who should Return, but can be erratic in her decisions.
[[Awakening\|Awakening]] has the easiest prerequisites of all: anyone who is given [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]] can use it for Awakening (even, hypothetically, real-world humans), and Endowment provides each Nalthian with a Breath automatically.

## Sel
The moment of a [[Selish\|Selish]] person turning into an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] and gaining access to the [[AonDor\|AonDor]] is called the [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. It is distinctive in that it only affects those with sufficient [[Connection\|Connection]] to certain geographical areas on [[Sel\|Sel]], primarily [[Arelon\|Arelon]], which happens because the Investiture of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] is trapped in the Cognitive Realm rather than the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]]. [[Khriss\|Khriss]] considers it one of the more mysterious forms of Initiation, as she is unable to find out anything about how Elantrians are chosen beyond the geographical restriction; she guesses that there may simply be an element of randomness involved.
Little is known about [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]], but it may only be available to those from [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]], and training in [[Dakhor Monastery\|Dakhor Monastery]] somehow enables monks to access it.

## Taldain
The precise method of Initiation for [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]] on [[Taldain\|Taldain]] is unknown, but it differs from that of AonDor.

## Vax
Initiation on [[Vax\|Vax]] works differently than it does on Sel, Scadrial, Nalthis, or Taldain.

## Trivia
An out-of-universe reason that the magic systems often target broken people is that "characters in pain are the most interesting to write about".
