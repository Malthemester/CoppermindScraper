>“*They were destruction made manifest, Brightlord. Each one was so profoundly devastating that humankind was left broken. Populations ruined, society crippled, scholars dead. Humankind was forced to spend generations rebuilding after each one.*”
\-Kalami describing a Desolation[1]


The **Desolations** are cataclysmic events on Roshar involving the Heralds and the Voidbringers. They were massive, continent-wide wars. After each Desolation, human civilization lay in ruins.

## Participants
### Heralds

The [[Herald\|Heralds]] were the leaders of Honor's forces during the Desolations. They were responsible for teaching mankind skills to help them prepare for the coming conflict. For example, [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] taught leadership, [[Vedel\|Vedel]] trained surgeons, and [[Kalak\|Kalak]] taught how to cast bronze. They were also each the patron of a Radiant order and helped to guide and lead the Knights. They were involved in combat, with [[Taln\|Taln]] in particular becoming known for his choice of impossible battles that he won. In between Desolations, the Heralds were the ones on [[Braize\|Braize]] holding back the [[Fused\|Fused]]. They had made the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] with Honor which gave them the [[Honorblade\|honorblades]] and the ability to hold back the Fused. However, a loophole in the Oathpact allowed them to bend and temporarily allow the Fused to Roshar, leading them to getting captured and tortured on Braize.

### Knights Radiant

>“*They were a solution, a way to offset the destruction of the Desolations. Ten orders of knights, founded with the purpose of helping men fight, then rebuild.*”
\-Dalinar's visions[7]

The Knights Radiant were originally a surprise to Honor, as he had not shown it to the Heralds. Spren decided to mimic the Heralds and give men access to Surgebinding by forming [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]]. While the Knights Radiant as a whole helped in fighting the Voidbringers and rebuilding society, each order of Knights fulfilled a different role. The [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]] acted as scouts, the [[Stonewards\|Stonewards]] acted as front line soldiers, and the [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweavers]] gave spiritual sustenance to the troops. Many of the Radiants, particularly the Windrunners, lived in cities in [[Alethela\|Alethela]] and crossed borders into other nations to fight. The [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] that Radiants could wield gave them a better chance when fighting the Voidbringers, particularly the [[Thunderclast\|Thunderclasts]]. The Radiants invited any with the desire and ability to fight or lead to come get training and potentially join them.

### Voidbringers

[[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] is the collective term that refers to all the forces allied with the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Odium\|Odium]] during a Desolation. Beings that count as Voidbringers include the [[Fused\|Fused]], [[Regal\|Regals]], [[Singer\|singers]], [[Voidspren\|Voidspren]], [[Unmade\|Unmade]], and [[Thunderclast\|Thunderclasts]]. The Voidbringers follow a strict hierarchy. The Fused are at the top, far above the Regals. The Regals, who have bonded voidspren and attained forms of power, are above common singers. Where sapient Voidspren and Unmade fall in this hierarchy is currently unknown, though [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] in particular has been described as a commander of Odium's forces, so she is likely near the top of the hierarchy. Some humans chose to fight for the Voidbringers as well.

## History
### The First Desolation
The first Desolation occurred when mankind invaded [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Humans had destroyed their previous home with surgebinding and came to Roshar seeking shelter. The [[Singer\|singers]] granted them the land that would later become [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. Dissatisfied with what they had been given, the humans decided to invade the rest of the continent. This was the first military conflict between humans and singers. A singer who witnessed the invasion wrote the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] as a warning against trusting humans.

### The Oathpact

Some of the singers that were killed by the invading humans were infused with power by Odium before they passed [[Beyond\|Beyond]]. These singers became the [[Fused\|Fused]], [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]] that possess living singers and could not be killed. [[Ishar\|Ishar]] founded the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] as a solution. He and the other nine people that would become Heralds made a pact with Honor to seal the Fused on [[Braize\|Braize]]. [[Taln\|Taln]] was not originally meant to join the Heralds, but somehow became part of the group. The Heralds thought the Oathpact would end the endless war, but because they are human, there was a loophole. The Heralds had the ability to bend their oath and let the Fused return to Roshar, starting a Desolation. Knowing this loophole, the Fused captured and tortured the Heralds.

### Historical Desolations
 by  Greg Call  An in-world artist's depiction of a Desolation by [[Greg Call\|Greg Call]]
The coming of a Desolation was announced by the appearance of the Ten [[Herald\|Heralds]]. The appearance of [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] was also a sign of an upcoming Desolation. A Desolation began when the Fused returned to Roshar, known as the **Return**. Each Return, Fused needed to find singers willing to give the Fused their bodies. One of the Desolations lasted eleven years. There were not many more than fifteen Desolations total. A Desolation ended with the Heralds leaving Roshar and returning to Braize. The Heralds had a fixed period of time they could remain on Roshar. If they exceeded it, a new Desolation would start.

### Between Desolations
>“*In the aftermath of each one, mankind was broken. Great cities in ashes, industry smashed. Each time, knowledge and growth were reduced to an almost prehistoric state.*”
\-Jasnah[3]


Mankind was devastated in the aftermath of each desolation. Around ninety percent of the population was destroyed each time, leading to fall of many nations; many, such as [[Eiliz\|Eiliz]] and [[Tarma\|Tarma]], would disappear from history altogether. This level of cataclysmic event pushed men to a technology level equivalent to that of the stone age. Although society would sometimes progress beyond that before the next Desolation began, the Heralds would often be forced to push technology forward thousands of years in the single year after their return. It is the duty of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] to stay vigilant and prepare themselves and mankind for Desolations, and to fight the Voidbringers when it arrives.
Between Desolations, the Heralds returned to Braize. At first, the ten men and women hid from and fought the Fused. Inevitably, they would be caught and tortured. By the nature of their bond, the Heralds were able share their pain and withstand the torture together until someone broke. Early on, the Heralds were able to withstand torture for hundreds of years between Desolations. The torture slowly broke the Heralds, however, and the gaps were decreasing to less than ten years near the end. The last gap was less than a year long, with the Heralds breaking as soon as the Fused caught and began the torture. The only Herald to never break was Taln. The torture the Heralds endured between Desolations included hooks digging into their skin, their skin getting seared off, and their fat burning. The torture began over again every day.

### The Last Desolation

At the end of what is called the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]], nine of ten Heralds managed to survive the fighting, which was an unusual occurrence. Fearful of the torture they would face on their return to Braize, the Heralds chose to break the Oathpact rather than return. Although they had been warned that lingering on Roshar would lead to another Desolation, Ishar told the others that Taln alone would be enough to maintain the Oathpact. Whether or not this was true mattered little to the Heralds as they only wished to avoid torture. The Heralds left their Honorblades in a circle and all walked in a different direction, telling people that humanity had finally won the war for good. Ishar's prediction turned out to be true, and Taln held back the Fused for 4500 years while mankind believed there would be no more Desolations.

### The False Desolation

>“*Something must be done about the remnants of Odium’s forces. The parsh, as they are now called, continue their war with zeal, even without their masters from Damnation.*”
\-Drawer 30-20, first emerald[27]

Unlike previous Desolations, the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]] did not involve the Heralds or Fused. The False Desolation began when [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] learned how to [[Connection\|Connect]] with the majority of the singers, giving them [[Regal\|forms of power]] and access to [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]]. The Radiants, unaware of how she did this, sought a way to end the fighting for good, as the Heralds had promised them. The fighting became particularly intense at this time, as the singers made a push towards [[Feverstone Keep\|Feverstone Keep]], possibly as part of a plan to capture [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]].
Working together, the scholars among the Radiants theorized that an [[Unmade\|Unmade]] could be imprisoned like a regular [[Spren\|spren]]. That devised a plan to trap Ba-Ado-Mishram and prevent her from Connecting with the singers and providing them with Voidlight. This plan would require [[Melishi\|Melishi]], the only [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] of his generation, and a special prison, likely a [[Perfect gemstone\|perfect gemstone]]. Although Melishi was confident the plan would succeed in destroying the Voidbringers, [[Naze-daughter-Kuzodo\|Naze-daughter-Kuzodo]] warned of unintended side effects. Although the plan seems to have succeeded, as Ba-Ado-Mishram has not been seen in modern times unlike other Unmade, Naze-daughter-Kuzodo's warning was correct. Because she had been Connected to all the singers, their Connection and [[Identity\|Identity]] was torn out of them, creating slaveform or parshmen. The Radiants' horror for what happened likely contributed to the Recreance.

### The True Desolation

The True Desolation began approximately two thousand years after the False Desolation, when Talenel appears at the gates of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], after returning to Roshar from Braize. Not all that long after, at the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Stormform [[Listener\|Listeners]] summon the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], which appears to begin the True Desolation.

## Warfare
### Fabrials

>“*All this time we’ve been assuming that we lost great technology in the Desolations, but it seems we are far, far more advanced than the ancients ever were.*”
\-Jasnah about fabrials[39]


During the ancient Desolations, mankind did not have access to the modern [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] and fabrial knowledge that is currently known on Roshar. The only fabrials they had access to were ancient fabrials. These fabrials seem to work through a mutual agreement with a sentient spren rather than trapping a spren in a gemstone. The vast majority of fabrials seem to replicate surges and were used in a support position rather than actual combat. The [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] utilizes the surge of Transportation to allow instantaneous travel across the continent. Healing fabrials use the surge of Progression to heal wounds and seem to have been carried often by Radiants on patrol. Although it is not courrently known how these fabrials were created, [[Aimia\|Aimia]] could have been involved as that is where [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] fabrials originated. It is also possible that [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] is a giant fabrial powered by the [[Sibling\|Sibling]].

### Technology
>“*The Desolations were so terrible they destroyed learning and progress and left behind a broken people.*”
\-Jasnah to Dalinar[6]


Humanity was stuck at an extremely low level of technology during the Desolations. Most soldiers fought with bronze and leather armor. Because of the destruction, humanity often still had stone tools and weapons when the Heralds returned. The Heralds would attempt to push humanity forward several thousand years worth of technology in the year before the Desolation, which often included learning to cast bronze. Even when humanity had learned to cast bronze already, the Heralds tried to advance technology further. Other areas they attempted to push technology forward include medicine, where Vedel would teach techniques such as keeping wounds clean.

## Culture

>“*The Desolations had happened during the near-mythical shadowdays, before real history began. Before mankind had defeated the Voidbringers and taken the war to heaven.*”
\-Dalinar's thoughts[11]


According to Vorinism, mankind fought the Voidbringers during Desolations ninety and nine times, before mankind finally won and drove them back to the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]]. That victory was later referred to as the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]].
