Brightlady **Hamaradin** was a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] member of [[Vamah princedom\|Vamah's]] court in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
House Hamaradin was known to have a spy network, and Brightlady Hamaradin was personally involved in these activities. Ishnah claimed to have been trained as a spy for House Hamaradin, learning various techniques such as information gathering and message coding. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] investigated Ishnah and found that she did indeed perform espionage for House Hamaradin, but was merely an assistant rather than a true spy.
At one point, Ishnah overheard Brightlady Hamaradin talking about the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]]. Ishnah believed that Hamaradin somehow crossed the Ghostbloods and they killed her. She may have died after the Alethi moved from the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], as some of the people in House Hamaradin's employ were accused of the murder and went underground there.
