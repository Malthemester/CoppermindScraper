## Appearance and Anatomy
The Unkalaki are a human race with [[Listener\|listener]] blood in their ancestry. As a result, they have a higher tendency to be asexual than other races without listener ancestors. Furthermore, they seem to be able to faintly hear the [[Rhythm\|rhythms]] of Roshar, although it remains unclear whether they are able to distinguish them or attribute them to certain feelings.
Features that are often associated with Horneaters are pale skin, tall stature, and red hair. Their lines mixed with that of the [[Veden\|Vedens]] at some point; by the era of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], traditional Veden coloring includes such features as red hair and freckles, inherited from the Horneaters. Because of their singer heritage, the Unkalaki have extra jaw pieces at the back of their mouths which help them eat shells. This is likely the reason they are called Horneaters.

### The Sighted
Some Horneaters are born with the ability to see normally invisible [[Spren\|spren]] like [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]]. These individuals are called *alaii'iku*, or the [[Sighted\|Sighted]]. This congenital ability is hereditary, extremely rare, and seems to be a gift given specifically to the extended family to which [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] belongs. Some of the Unkalaki (although possibly only the Sighted) consider themselves 'Guardians of the Pool', which likely refers to [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]]. There is also a specific role of "watcher of the pool" which [[Cord\|Cord's]] grandmother once served as.

## Culture
### Occupation
A Horneater's occupation is determined by birth order. First and second sons obtain food, third sons are craftsmen, and fourth sons and younger are warriors. If siblings die, the younger ones advance in this order of professions, meaning a son that started training as a warrior would be forced to abandon his career in order to become a craftsman if his older brother died. It is not entirely clear how daughters fit into this system. This regulation reflects the social status of each type of profession in the Horneater culture. Basic functions like gathering food are valued the most, while professions related to warfare are seen as least important. Therefore, a third son craftsman like [[Rock\|Rock]] refuses to become a spearman soldier like the rest of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] because it would be "beneath him".
Horneaters, when making a living outside of the Peaks, prefer to work in the same business as a family unit. They work in a variety of professions, from masseuses and servants to guards.

### Political Structure and Military
>“*The nuatoma, they see our lack of Shards as a great shame. They want these weapons very badly. It is believed that the nuatoma who first obtains a Shardblade would become king, a thing we have not had for many years. No peak would fight another peak where a man held one of the blessed Blades.*”
\-Rock to Kaladin and Teft[18]

The Unkalaki are organized in clan-like social structures. The leaders of these clans are called [[Nuatoma\|Nuatoma]]. The relatives of a Nuatoma serve him and act as his household. Nuatomas regularly leave the Horneater homeland in attempts to win Shards in duels with [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]]. The first Nuatoma to win a Shardblade would become the king of the Unkalaki. It is unclear if Nuatomas are fourth sons or if their position excludes them from the normal profession system.
Since the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the Unkalaki have obtained two sets of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]]. The first is obtained by [[Rock\|Rock]] during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], where he uses a [[Grandbow\|grandbow]] to kill [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]]. While he also wins the [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)\|Oathbringer]], he returns this to [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] in repayment of a debt. The second set is discovered by [[Cord\|Cord]] on the [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]]. When Cord bonds the Shardplate, she becomes the first Shardbearer among her people in a very long time.
The ruler of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] is able to levy troops from the population of Horneaters, which is one reason why the Vedens argue against ceding the Horneater Peaks to [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. The Unkalaki also have aided the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] by supplying batches of arrows for their armies. These arrows are unique, being fletched with white "goosefeathers."

### Other
At one point, [[Rock\|Rock]] tells [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] about the Unkalaki dueling system, saying that the two men would drink [[Mudbeer\|mudbeer]] and sing until one of them gives up. The point is that by the end of the duel, no one will recall why they were fighting.
Unkalaki names are usually entire sentences in the form of poems, which makes them hard to remember for people who are used to [[Alethi\|Alethi]] names. Insults with similar rhyme and structure as the poem name of the insulted party are valued especially highly in conflicts among Horneaters.
Rock wears a beard style called *humaka'aban*, which he says is the pride of every Unkalaki. Kaladin describes it as long sideburns that curve down to the chin. The chin itself and the area around the lips are cleanly shaven. Rock seems reluctant to the idea that other people besides Horneaters could wear the beard style.
Unkalaki engage in trade with inhabitants of [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], and [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] is one of the commodities they have received. In fact, there is a clan of Horneaters that lives in Shadesmar, including a handful that reside in [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] during the time of the fortress' isolationist policy.

## Cuisine
The Unkalaki received their common name "Horneaters" due to their ability to eat the hard shells of crustaceans. [[Rock\|Rock]] ascribes this ability to their unusually strong teeth. Unkalaki cuisine utilizes less spices than [[Alethi\|Alethi]] cuisine. One stew recipe that Rock divulges consists only of "Take everything you have, and put him in pot. Don’t let anyone airsick touch seasonings."

>“*Your food here, it has so many spices that you cannot taste anything else. Might as well be eating stones powdered with pepper!*”
\-Rock to Kaladin and Teft[18]


In general, Horneater beverages have a quite sharp and immediately overpowering taste and smell. Horneater lager has the reputation to melt teeth and cups.  Also, strongest among the Horneater beverages is the Horneater white. A clear, distilled moonshine, it is the strongest known alcohol on Roshar (with the possible exception of some violet wines). It is known to strip paint, and can apparently be deadly to non-Unkalaki. There is also a non-alcoholic beverage called [[Shiki\|shiki]], which is brown in color and is served chilled, and a tea-like beverage that tastes of boiled grain but is an old, traditional recipe.

## Religion and Mythology
The Horneaters have three powerful gods they once sought aid from: the gods of the waters, the gods of the mountains, and the gods of the trees. Unkalaki stories teach that gods cannot be fought but must always be tricked. Lunu'anaki is the name of the Unkalaki god of travel and mischief who cannot hurt man. Rock saw [[Hoid\|Hoid]] emerge from [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] and came to the conclusion that he must be Lunu'anaki. [[Spren\|Spren]] are also worshipped by the Unkalaki as gods; Rock offers to build a shrine for [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]] at one point. Unkalaki also have fairly extensive legends of a group called the [[Sleepless\|Gods Who Sleep Not]] who are dangerous, secretive entities that guard terrible treasures and are composed of a swarm of [[Cremling\|cremlings]] that share one mind. Lunu'anaki warned the Horneaters of this group during the time of [[Cord\|Cord's]] grandmother. In addition to learning about these gods, Horneaters receive occasional monks from [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], who preach [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]] to them.
Naturally heated lakes on the Horneater Peaks are called oceans by the locals. There is an ocean on each of the peaks. Underneath the normal water is the so-called *Water of life*. It is said to be connected to the gods, and Horneaters who swim in the oceans can sometimes see the *Place of the Gods* (this is likely access to [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] via [[Cultivation\|Cultivation's]] [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]]). Swimming in the oceans is said to be lethal to outsiders, though, according to [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]], this is only because the Unkalaki execute any outsiders who swim in their oceans.
There are ancient Unkalaki songs that refer to when the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] was brought to Roshar. It is possible these songs are considered sacred to the Unkalaki.
According to Unkalaki legends, when someone draws the [[Bow of Hours\|Bow of Hours]] it heralds "years of change." Unkalaki legends speak of an ancient [[Pact of the Seven Peaks\|pact of the Seven Peaks]] which was made with gods. The Fal'ala'liki'nor, One Who Draws the Bow of Hours, may be involved with these treaties.

### The Story of the Horneater Peaks
Rock tells members of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] the story of how the Unkalaki claimed the Horneater Peaks.
The Unkalaki were at the brink of extinction due to their belligerent nature at that time. They had a leader called *tana'kai* who talked to the three most powerful kinds of gods on Roshar and asked them for shelter. They were the gods of the trees, the waters, and the mountains respectively.
Both the gods of the trees and the gods of the waters refuse to give them shelter since they cannot guarantee the safety of the Unkalaki. The gods of the mountains do not outright decline the request but tell the *tana'kai* that his slopes are places only for spirits, and they cannot sustain life. The *tana'kai* solves the dilemma by asking the gods of the waters to place lakes on the peaks of the mountains, the mountain gods to heat them with their thermal energy from the depths of the earth, and the gods of the forests to bring edible plants to the now habitable areas on the mountain peaks. The gods were pleased with this solution, and the Horneaters moved to the peaks.
Whether these three sets of gods are related to the three [[Shard\|Shards]] on Roshar is unknown.

## Language
The Unkalaki language is part of the Dawnate language family, with distant roots in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. Though the vocabulary is distinctive, it shares similar grammar with the [[Shin\|Shin]] and [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] languages.
When speaking Alethi or Veden, one feature of the Unkalaki 'accent' is a tendency to use gendered pronouns (e.g. "he") in places where a non-gendered pronoun ("it") would be more appropriate. This may imply that their own native language uses . This manner of speech is sufficiently recognizable that [[Shallan\|Shallan]] intentionally adopts it while impersonating a Horneater princess.
