**Wilson** is the butler of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds]]. Not himself a hallucination, he is "an excellent servant and an excellent person", one of the few who does not mind, or even put up with his master's peculiarities. He often goes through the motions of making sure all of Leeds' hallucinations are comfortable, and also fetches them from their rooms and, when they ask for refreshments or foodstuffs, pretends to give them to them. Wilson turns seventy and retires the day after Stephen found [[Sandra\|Sandra]].
Wilson is not, however, a sycophant. He calls Stephen out for acting improperly or disrespectfully towards clients and visitors.
