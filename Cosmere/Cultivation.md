\-Cultivation to Dalinar[4]

**Cultivation** is one of the sixteen [[Shard\|Shards of Adonalsium]]. Her Vessel is a [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragon]] named [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]], though [[Hoid\|Hoid]] has referred to her as **Slammer**. Cultivation resides on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], having originally come there with [[Honor\|Honor]] before [[Odium\|Odium's]] arrival. Cultivation's [[Investiture\|Investiture]] is typically associated with the color green.

## Intent
Cultivation's intent as a Shard appears to be related to transformation. According to Odium, all she wishes to see is change, regardless of where it leads. In her own view, on the other hand, she wishes to grow things and people, and prune them if need be, to shape them in a desired form, even if she accepts that there will always be a degree of uncertainty.

## Associated Magics
 by  paintweaver 
### Surgebinding
For more information, see [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].
Surgebinding is a magic system derived from both Cultivation and [[Honor\|Honor]]. To Surgebind, a person must bond a [[Spren\|spren]], which grants them the ability to inhale [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and use it for various purposes, chief among them self-healing and manipulating [[Surge\|Surges]], the fundamental forces of Roshar. Some Surges are more inclined towards Cultivation, while others are closer to Honor. Additionally, some of the Radiant spren appear to be closer to Cultivation than others.
The spren capable of forming the Radiant bonds are likewise a mix of Cultivation and Honor's [[Investiture\|Investitures]]; as such, a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] is a mix of her and his metals.

### Old Magic
For more information, see [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]].
Old Magic is a magic "system" that appears to be usable only by Cultivation and [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. It allows for granting another person a boon and a bane based on their request. The boons and banes can range from physical objects, such as money or swords, to mental alterations, such as making a person see upside-down for the rest of their life, or erasing memories. It even permits [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic]] changes, such as granting a new and unique way of acquiring Investiture.
Although the Nightwatcher has no known agenda in her boons and banes, Cultivation occasionally intervenes when she can further her plans. These include granting [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] the capacity to Ascend to [[Odium\|Odium]] and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] the emotional fortitude to avoid becoming Odium's champion.
There is more to Old Magic than just boons and banes; however, there is no person currently known to make use of that.

### Lifelight
Cultivation has her own form of gaseous Investiture, Lifelight, that is comparable to the Scadrian [[Mist\|mists]], [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], and [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]]. When visiting the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]], Dalinar sees Cultivation surrounded by green mist, which is likely Lifelight. It can both be captured in gems and serve as a power source much like the other two Lights. In fact, [[Lift\|Lift's]] Investiture that she generates by transmuting consumed food is Lifelight and not Stormlight. The power that the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] uses, [[Towerlight\|Towerlight]], is a mixture of Lifelight and Stormlight.
Lifelight takes up the middle note on the Rosharan .

### Other
Cultivation is capable of seeing the future, with [[Honor\|Honor]] mentioning that she is much better at it than he ever was. While certainly one of the better users of future sight in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], she herself admits that she cannot truly predict everything.
She is capable of creating [[Spren\|spren]] of herself, the chief example of this being the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. This being said, the Nightwatcher is not very humanlike, and so Cultivation keeps her in the [[Valley\|Valley]] to hold court, and grants her the use of the Old Magic. [[Cultivationspren\|Cultivationspren]] are also likely tied to Cultivation herself, as they refer to her as "Mother".
Something about her presence on Roshar, whether intentional or otherwise, makes it easier for animal life there to attain a degree of sentience, with both [[Ryshadium\|Ryshadium]] and [[Santhid\|santhidyn]] being far more intelligent than their peers for this reason.
[[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] is located in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], and forms either one or all of the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]], the giant lakes at the top of the mountains. Until the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], where it was overtaken by the [[Fused\|Fused]], it was the main way for [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] to travel to and from Roshar.
Cultivation appears to have the ability to kill or at least seriously wound [[Odium\|Odium]], as he refrained from killing the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] out of fear of leaving himself exposed to her counterattack.

## History

For the history of the original Vessel, see Koravellium Avast#History.
### Shattering and ancient Roshar
>“*I think there's only one [woman of my age] around these parts, and she and I never did get along.*”
\-Hoid[31]


The Shard of Cultivation was created during the Shattering, and was subsequently taken up by [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]]. She and [[Honor\|Honor]], with whom she was romantically involved, departed the site of the Shattering, [[Yolen\|Yolen]], and ended up on Roshar. There, they became the gods of a local sentient species known as the [[Singer\|singers]]. However, following [[Odium\|Odium's]] arrival in the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]], the two Shards ended up siding with human newcomers instead.
Although Cultivation assisted Honor in fighting Odium, Honor still perished. Following his death, Cultivation withdrew in grief, and appeared to have lost all interest in aiding mankind any longer. This was not entirely correct, however -- rather than hiding, she was planning.
Cultivation also briefly spent time on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]].

### Era of Solitude
In the late [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], Cultivation used the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]] at least thrice. She granted [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] fluctuating amounts of compassion and intelligence, ultimately grooming him to take up the [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Odium\|Odium]], which required compassion, and to master its [[Shard\|Intent]], which required the intelligence. She altered [[Lift\|Lift's]] Surgebinding so it was powered by Lifelight, rather than Stormlight, though Lift's boon and curse are not known. She also intervened when [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] came to see the Nightwatcher and begged for forgiveness. Instead of this, she erased all memories of [[Evi\|his wife]], which served as both a boon and a curse.
Unlike with all other boons and curses, Dalinar's memories gradually returned after the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. This was deliberately engineered by Cultivation to give him time to come to terms with his past before [[Odium\|Odium]] would try to use it to turn Dalinar into his champion.

>“*Storming Mother of the World and Father of Storms above!*”
\-Lift[39]


Cultivation has been honored on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] for a long time, at least since the era of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. In the present day, however, her worship is limited to the western part of the continent, where she is considered an embodiment of nature and nature [[Spren\|spren]]. There, she is sometimes referred to as **Mother of the World**. Even in the east, people sometimes make references to Mother Cultivation, though typically as a joke. In [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], belief in her and her cohorts, such as the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]], is considered pagan superstition and usually dismissed.
Cultivation is also highly revered by [[Cultivationspren\|cultivationspren]]. Though the precise relation between them and her is unclear, they often call her Mother or Blessed Mother, and only sometimes by her proper name. "Mother's vines" appears to be a particular curse related to Cultivation.

## Trivia
Cultivation always speaks in small-caps, similarly to the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]]. [[Honor\|Honor]], by contrast, spoke in normal font in the [[Dalinar's visions\|the visions he left for Bondsmiths]].
In *Magic:The Gathering* colors, Cultivation would be green.
Cultivation has never really gotten along with Hoid.
