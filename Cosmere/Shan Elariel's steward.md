**Shan Elariel** employs a **Terrisman steward** at [[Keep Elariel\|Keep Elariel]] in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
Shan's steward wears a [[Tinningdar\|tinningdar]], presumably in the colors of House Elariel. He wears a great deal of jewelry, although there is no indication that he is a [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]]. Like all stewards in the Final Empire, he is a eunuch. Vin notes that he does not have the same "spirit" as [[Sazed\|Sazed]], and that he always maintains a flat expression. He has a faint Terris accent.

## History
Shan's steward was present at the ball at Keep Elariel when [[Vin\|Vin]] first used her "Valette Renoux" persona and met [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]]. After Elend was seen talking to Valette, the steward was sent to her table with a request (or rather, a demand) from Shan to join her. As Shan met and demeaned Valette, her steward took her dessert plate to the kitchen to be washed. When he returned, Valette noticed that he surreptitiously walked to the table where she had been sitting, looking at some books that Elend had left there. Valette awkwardly excused herself from Shan's table to go interrupt him. The steward saw her coming and smoothly moved on from the table as if nothing had happened. Vin learned that some of the books discussed rebellion against the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], and that Shan likely sent the steward to investigate because she had suspicions about Elend's political leanings. The steward later accompanied Shan to another ball at [[Keep Lekal\|Keep Lekal]].
