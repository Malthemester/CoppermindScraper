**Fellise** was a small, suburban town in the [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]], relatively close to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. It was a prosperous city with a reputation for being less crowded, cleaner, and less strict in enforcing the imperial laws than the capital. The nobility kept lavish villas and manors rather than the fortified keeps of Luthadel, and built them in a well-maintained and tidy part of the city. Some of the cobblestone streets are lined with aspen trees as the bark tends to resist ash stains. Vin notes though that the slums are much the same as they are in other cities.. Many parts of the city are made of white-washed granite, a stark contrast to the black coloring of Luthadel. During the late night, its streets are often empty and silent.
By carriage, Fellise is an hour away from Luthadel, but there is an allomantic roadway that allows very rapid travel between the two cities. It consists of a series of bronze bars embedded into the earth, made in a straight line for Coinshots and mistborn to use to travel quickly. It is unknown who made the roadway, and its possible that it was Kelsier.
[[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Reen\|Reen]] had worked there for a while before moving into Luthadel. Vin stayed in the town posing as a young member of [[House Renoux\|House Renoux]], a minor house supposedly interested in making alliances in the city nearby. Previously, she had worked in the city while travelling with her brother [[Reen\|Reen]] before moving to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]].  She also trained as a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] here under [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]].
