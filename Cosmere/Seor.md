**Seor** was an ancient [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] scholar on [[Sel\|Sel]]. His name is based on Aon Seo.
He authored the book *Seor's Encyclopedia of Political Myths*, a treatise regarding the false rhetoric of [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] and the [[Derethi\|Derethi]] church. [[Sarene\|Sarene]] is fascinated by the book, and tells [[Raoden\|Raoden]] that it contains the original version of the poem *Wyrn the King*. The poem was later altered by Derethi priests to both falsely indicate that the original [[Wyrn (character)\|Wyrn]] was Derethi and to elevate [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] from a minor god to the primary deity of Shu-Dereth. Sarene believes that the original version of the poem was suppressed by Fjorden, and would be a major embarrassment to them if it were publicized.
