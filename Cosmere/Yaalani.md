**Yaalani the Brave** is a mythological [[Eelakin\|Eelakin]] woman on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]].

## History
According to legend, Yaalani is the only female trapper recorded in Eelakin history. She ignored custom and traveled to the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]] to perform the incredibly dangerous task of trapping [[Aviar\|Aviar]]. Her story is well known and often told to young girls.
[[Vathi\|Vathi]], a well-educated Eelakin woman, grew up listening to stories of Yaalani. She has since learned of myths from many other cultures wherein an extraordinary woman served in a role traditionally held by men, such as a warrior, general, or trapper. Vathi believes that Yaalani and other myths regarding gender role reversal are actually used by parents to remind girls that breaking tradition is the exception and not the rule.

## Trivia
*Sixth of the Dusk* takes place near the end of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] timeline and some readers have speculated about Yaalani's identity, but Brandon has confirmed that Yaalani is not from another work currently (as of the release of *Oathbringer*).
