**Victory Flight** is a part of the [[DDF\|DDF]] and is made up of full pilots that have graduated [[Flight School\|Flight School]].
The Flight was called up from reserve to provide backup and take over from [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] during a battle. Before Victory Flight arrived, the group of cadets were attacked and forced to engage the enemy. Victory Flight arrived moments before [[Hurl\|Hurl]] lost control of her [[Poco\|Poco]] and crashed, believing that she could safely land the broken ship. Victory Flight took over the fight allowing the remaining members of Skyward Flight to pull out of the battle and retreat.
When the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] sent their battleship forward to begin bombarding [[Detritus\|Detritus]], Victory Flight was one of the flights sent up to fight off the Krell so that [[FM\|FM]] could disable the cannon. Victory Flight and [[Valkyrie Flight\|Valkyrie Flight]] preformed the task of clearing a pathway to the battleship, letting [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] follow in their wake. When FM began to shoot at the cannon, Victory Flight and Valkyrie Flight nipped at the Krell’s heels, distracting them from getting to FM. Eventually there were too many Krell, and FM had to retreat. When the battleship began firing, Victory Flight retreated back to [[Platform Prime\|Platform Prime]] with the other flights on [[Matthew Cobb\|Cobb’s]] orders.

>“*Protect the city. Victory Flight, make sure the city itself doesn’t take fire. Keep the enemy distracted.*”
\-Jorgen to Victory Flight[3]

When Superiority forces attacked the planet [[Evershore (planet)\|Evershore]], Victory Flight was one of the flights called into action to protect the planet, alongside [[Stardragon Flight\|Stardragon Flight]] and [[Ivy Flight\|Ivy Flight]]. Victory Flight had a few [[Taynix\|taynix]], and used them to hyperjump to Evershore. Victory Flight was assigned by [[Jorgen Weight\|Jorgen]] to protect the city of [[Dreamspring\|Dreamspring]] closely, providing a line of defense if any Superiority ships got past Ivy Flight and Stardragon Flight.
