## Geography
The region covers the southern center of the Rosharan continent. It is framed by mountain ranges to the north, east, and west, and has a long coastline on the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]]. The region includes the nations of [[Alm\|Alm]], [[Azir\|Azir]], [[Desh\|Desh]], [[Emul\|Emul]], [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]], [[Liafor\|Liafor]], [[Marat\|Marat]], [[Steen\|Steen]], [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]], [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]], [[Tukar\|Tukar]], [[Yezier\|Yezier]], and about half of [[Triax\|Triax]]. The Azish Empire includes many of these nations, although it does not encompass the entirety of Makabak. Makabak has a single [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], in the Azish capital of [[Azimir\|Azimir]].

## Culture
Makabaki people generally have dark brown skin, black hair, and dark eyes. The region borders [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], but the Makabaki do not have the round eyes of the Shin. There are approximately thirty Makabaki languages, most of which branched off from Azish. Many of the nations are rich in culture and have thriving trade. The area has higher population density than the nations to the east and Azimir is larger than [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
Residents of several Makabaki nations are thought to avoid offending others as much as possible, and would rather dodge a request than deny it, especially if it comes from a foreigner. Azish people are considered verbose and sometimes intentionally vague in order to conceal their true intentions. The Azish Empire has many skilled clerks and scribes, and is thought of as highly lawful, bureaucratic, and organized.
The Makabaki worship the [[Heralds\|Heralds]] not the Almighty.

## Politics
Azir is the largest nation in the region, and its [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] traditionally claims authority as emperor of Makabak; in practice, the Prime only rules Azir. Other member states of the Azish Empire recognize the monarchy and still follow certain traditions in regards to the Prime Aqasix, but they are actually governed with a high degree of autonomy. Even though Azir does not actually rule the entire region, it is still highly influential. Feuds between nations are thought to be common, although the true nature of the feuds is disputed. Emul and Tukar are currently at war. The leaders of each nation are sometimes addressed by the name of their nation rather than their proper name.
The region is thought of as politically unimportant by residents of other nations; the lack of centralized political power causes many Makabak heads of state to be indecisive. The large [[Vorin\|Vorin]] kingdoms see the Makabaki as pagans and sometimes refer to the nations as "tribes" and to the people as "barbarians". Conversely, the Azish harbor ill will towards the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] due to a genocide perpetrated by their former king, [[Sadees\|Sadees]] the Sunmaker.
During [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] attempts to unite Roshar, [[Noura\|Noura]] unexpectedly tells him that Azir and several other Makabaki nations have agreed to meet with him in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. It is likely that some of the Makabaki leaders were more receptive to Dalinar's offer because the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] invaded the area during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], conquering portions of Emul and Marat as they positioned their armies to attack [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. Makabaki leaders are seen strategizing with Alethi leadership, which is notable because there have not been any formal alliances between the two regions in centuries. Dalinar thinks of the Azish generals as scribes and is surprised to learn that they have skill in military strategy.
