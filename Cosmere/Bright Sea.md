## Name
The Bright Sea is its original name. Since [[Idris\|Idris]] split from [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], Idrians call the sea the **Inner Sea**, to downplay its importance, since Idris was landlocked. Idris and Hallandren usually have different names for geographical features, due to the bad blood between them. However, in many cases, both names stuck, so Inner Sea and Bright Sea are used interchangeably by many.

## Geography
The people of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]] sailed the Bright Sea, coming from the east, and first discovered the place that would later be named [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].
At the time of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]], [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] owns approximately one third of the coast of the Bright Sea.
[[Tedradel\|Tedradel]] is also on the far side of the Bright Sea to Hallandren and [[Idris\|Idris]].
The [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] believe that the storms of the Bright Sea are a manifestation of their unity of five gods.

## Trade
[[T'Telir\|T'Telir's]] being located on the Bright Sea, as well as it's access to the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]], have turned the city into a prime port. It is a bustling city of commerce and trade in no small part due to the ease of access the Bright Sea provides. The Bright Sea is partly why [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] has become the economic powerhouse it is at the time of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]].
