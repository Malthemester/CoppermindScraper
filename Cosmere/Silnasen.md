**Silnasen** is a city on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is located at the foot of a mountain range in southern [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], near [[Triax\|Triax]] and [[Bavland\|Bavland]].

## History
Silnasen has an indigenous population that is distinct from the other Veden.
According to [[Natata Ved\|Natata Ved]], ancient Silnasen was ruled by a king named [[NanKhet\|NanKhet]]. NanKhet took over the throne after his brother, King [[NanHar\|NanHar]], died while campaigning with his army in modern-day [[Triax\|Triax]]. NanKhet survived six assassination attempts from his own family members in three months. Weary of defending his life, he executed hundreds of people at a feast, then choked to death when no one was left to help him. The Siln dynasty was founded after his death.
At some points in its history, Silnasen has been governed as an independent city-state. Their monarchs have generally declined to claim the first [[Dahn\|dahn]] in order to avoid provoking the Veden and [[Alethi\|Alethi]].

## Culture
In the present day, the Siln are thought of as a less modernized society than the rest of Jah Keved. [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] compares the Siln to other indigenous people in [[Iri\|Iri]] and the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]]. Their disputes tend to result in posturing rather than actual combat because they live a lifestyle in which hunting skill is too valuable to risk in battle. They are not known to commit assassinations.
At least some of the Siln people follow [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]]; a Siln [[Ardent\|ardent]] named [[Urv\|Urv]] studies at the [[Jokasha Monastery\|Jokasha Monastery]].
