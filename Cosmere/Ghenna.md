**Ghenna** is a scribe who works at the [[Grand Indicium\|Grand Indicium]] in [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]] in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is presumably a higher order scribe.

## Appearance and Personality
Ghenna wears a [[Shiqua\|shiqua]] that covers her entire body, including her face. She also wears glasses. She is described as being very overweight. She is pretty, and younger than Lift initially assumed. She is a fairly serious person and seems to take her job seriously as well; she only suffers Lift's flippant attitude due to the orders of the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]]. Lift liked to insult Ghenna, but seemed to be fond of her, at one point giving her an extended hug.

## History
>“*Half the time, I get the sense that even kings are confused by the world.*”
\-Ghenna[5]

Ghenna intercepted [[Lift\|Lift]] when the girl tried to get into the Grand Indicium. She did not initially believe that she was from the palace in Azimir. She changed her mind after [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] sent a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] instructing the scribes to listen to Lift. She then generally obeyed Lift's requests, unless orders from the Prince of Tashikk superseded Yanagawn's authority.
Ghenna went on to assist Lift in contacting the Prime Aquasix via spanreed on a few different occasions as they updated each other on their activities and the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. She helped Lift investigate [[Nale\|Nale's]] activities in Yeddaw and visited [[Tashi's Light Orphanage\|Tashi's Light Orphanage]] after Lift discovered that the [[Stump\|Stump]] was a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]].
