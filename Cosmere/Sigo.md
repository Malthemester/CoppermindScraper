The **Sigo** is a [[Starfighter\|starfighter]] used by the [[DDF\|DDF]].
[[Nightstorm Flight\|Nightstorm Flight]] uses Sigo-fighters that are branded with the flight's logo. Two members of Nightstorm Flight, Callsign [[Vent (Skyward)\|Vent]], and [[Nightstorm pilot seven\|his brother]] fly blue fighters.
Vent and his brother died during the fight at the shipyard, and the ships were presumably destroyed.
[[Jeshua Weight\|Jeshua Weight]] used to fly a Sigo and, after retiring from the DDF, kept a pewter figure of a Sigo in the center of the glass case with her medals; [[Jorgen Weight\|Jorgen]] notes she was very protective of it. As a kid, Jorgen would stare at the model for hours and think about the glory of being a pilot.
