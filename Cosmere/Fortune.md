## Nature
The precise nature of Fortune and how it functions and is used, is currently unclear. Fortune has been described as "luck" by less cosmere-aware groups, such as the [[Terris\|Terris]] three centuries after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. However, it is clear from other individuals that are more cosmere-aware that Fortune is more than simple luck. It's a way of knowing things you would not know otherwise, and a way in which one can see the future. It is implied that Fortune is a thing one can access and draw upon. Someone drawing upon Fortune can lead to events that appear to be coincidences.
Fortune and the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] are closely related. Future sight in the cosmere works through use of the Spiritual Realm. Fortune is one such way of accessing use of the Spiritual Realm, however individuals can see into the Spiritual Realm without using Fortune.
In general, future sight has been said to be dangerous in the cosmere, so Fortune would likely be as well. Any time someone sees the future, it will have ripples against someone else's ability to see the future.
Chromium can be used by a Feruchemist to store Fortune, but when used Hemalurgically, it doesn't steal Fortune, but destiny.

## Mentions
When the [[Ire\|Ire]] spotted an agent--who happened to be [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]]--[[Alonoe\|Alonoe]] thought the sighting was not a coincidence, but [[Elrao\|Elrao]], another member of the Ire, said the use of Fortune was not related to every coincidence.
[[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] said to [[Shallan\|Shallan]] that, during their trip into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] had foreseen danger by Fortune. Shallan had been suspicious, as she was told by Hoid to trust no one who sees the future--even Hoid.
[[Odium\|Odium]] remarked to [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] that the [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]] was impressive, considering he created it without access to Fortune, or the Spiritual Realm.
[[Venli\|Venli]] mentions the [[Rhythm\|Rhythm]] of Fortune in a context where a human might refer to luck, suggesting the [[Singer\|singers]] have some awareness of Fortune.
Three hundred and forty years after the Catacendre on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], the Terris were aware of Fortune. They knew a [[Chromium\|chromium]] [[Feruchemy\|Ferring]] (Spinner) could store Fortune. To most Terris, Fortune, as well as the other Spiritual metals of Feruchemy, were considered beyond understanding. These metals were under heavy experimentation by the Terris, but they did not fully understand their use at this time.
Hoid uses the same mechanics of chromium Feruchemy--Fortune--to know where he needs to go. However, his use of Fortune does not allow him to know why he needs to be in certain places.

## Trivia
Brandon had atium see the future so that he would foreshadow Fortune.
Brandon has said there is a "good reason" why he hasn't shown a character with Fortune yet, as he is saving that for later.
The [[Mistborn Adventure Game\|Mistborn Adventure Game's]] version of Fortune is not canonical, and Brandon had a different way for the mechanic to work.
