**Slickrock** is the name of a battle on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] between the forces of [[Nalanar\|Nalanar]] of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].

## History
The battle occurred prior to the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], likely during the period when [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] deployed Dalinar to [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]] and Jah Keved as a show of Alethi strength. The exact location is not known, but it presumably occurred on a field of [[Slickrock\|slickrock]] near the border of Jah Keved and Alethkar. An older soldier named [[Geved\|Geved]] fought in Nalanar's second infantry during the battle and survived despite Dalinar's victory.
Geved reminisced with Dalinar when they met in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Vedenar\|Battle of Vedenar]]; both men thought of the battle as a reminder of a simpler time. Dalinar conceded that Nalanar nearly beat him at three different points during the battle. Geved then contrasted his experiences during the battle of Slickrock with the horrific events of the [[Veden civil war\|Veden civil war]] and the effects of the [[Thrill\|Thrill]]. The Thrill began to take hold of Dalinar and he realized that it had moved from the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]].
