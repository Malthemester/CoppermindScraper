**Jerick** is a character from the unpublished work [[Dragonsteel Prime\|Dragonsteel Prime]].

## Behind the Scenes
Jerick was one of the first characters that [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] created, appearing in the very first story he wrote in his mid-teens. He was originally named "Rick", and at one point he was an elf. He was a hero character that was falsely accused of murder; Brandon later cited him as an example of a "flawless hero" in his writing who did not have internal struggles like those of [[Vin\|Vin]] or [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]].
Brandon has mentioned including Jerick as part of a rewritten *Dragonsteel* series on several occasions over the years, but this would not occur until after the completion of *The Stormlight Archive*. Because characters and plot points were cannibalized from *Dragonsteel* Prime to improve *The Way of Kings*, Jerick's character arc would need to be significantly changed.
