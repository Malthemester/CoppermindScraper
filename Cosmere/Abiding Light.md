**Abiding Light** is a lighthouse in the [[Sea of Souls\|Sea of Souls]], part of the [[Shadesmar\|Rosharan subastral]] of the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. It is located on a peninsula south of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and west of the [[Radiant Depths\|Radiant Depths]]. [[Reliqq's Channel\|Reliqq's Channel]] cuts through this peninsula. In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], the peninsula the lighthouse exists on is a river that separates [[Tukar\|Tukar]] and [[Marat\|Marat]].
Abiding Light's name and proximity to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] may suggest the place is under [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] control.
[[Nazh\|Nazh]] travels to Abiding Light, which only has a few attendants and their bratty children. However, Nazh very much liked the quiche at the lighthouse.
