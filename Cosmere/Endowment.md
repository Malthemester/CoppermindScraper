## Intent
Endowment's [[Shard\|Intent]] is not entirely clear; it's likely related to bestowing gifts or talents upon others. The Intent does not seem to influence [[Edgli\|Edgli]] in all matters, as she is still capable of refusing giving aid to [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. The prime examples of the Intent's influence are the creation of the Returned, via resurrection and a Returned Breath, and the magic system of [[Awakening\|Awakening]], as [[Breath\|Breath]] can only be given, and cannot be forcefully taken.
Endowment is the Shard Hoid would have taken if he wanted to become a Vessel.

## Associated Magic
 by  Ari Ibarra  An [[Awakener\|Awakener]] using her [[Breath\|Breath]]
### Breath and Awakening
For more information, see [[Awakening\|Awakening]].
Nalthis' only known magic system is [[Awakening\|Awakening]] -- the use of [[Breath\|Breath]], Endowment's [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in its gaseous form, to enact a variety of effects, typically tied to animating inanimate objects. Every Nalthian is born with a single Breath, and can bestow it onto other people or objects. Giving away one's Breath makes one into a Drab, which makes a person prone to depression and sickness. By contrast, holding more Breath grants a variety of benefits, the number of which increases with the number of Breaths held; the tiers of acquiring new abilities are called [[Heightening\|Heightenings]].
Breaths are bestowed upon others with [[Command\|Commands]]. The primary command is "My life to yours. My Breath become yours." However, hundreds of other Commands can be used to bestow Breath onto inanimate objects or dead bodies, Awakening them. Awakened objects perform specific task, dictated by their Commands, which can range from simple, such as "hold when thrown" to complex, such as "fetch keys". The more complex the Command, the more Breath it requires. Additionally, animating objects with Breath requires color; a nearby source of vivid color is required, and will be bleached, in order for the Command to take effect.
Breaths can also be used to manipulate and store memories, although specifics of how are unclear.

### Divine Breath and the Returned
For more information, see [[Returned\|Returned]].
>“*He remembered a voice, calm and comforting, offering him an opportunity. To Return.*”
\-Lightsong[13]


Endowment can create [[Splinter\|splinters]] of herself called Divine Breaths, and bestow them upon the recently deceased. This brings them back to life; such people are known as the [[Returned\|Returned]]. The Returned have little to no memory of their previous life, but they do retain any skills they've had while alive. Their appearance also changes, in accordance to how they perceive themselves and the influence of local culture on their image of a "god". With some skill, the Returned can change their appearance to some extent, though it is no true shapeshifting.
The Divine Breath immediately grants the Returned the effects of the Fifth [[Heightening\|Heightening]]. However, the Returned must consume at least one Breath a week; otherwise, after their Divine Breath is consumed and, with nothing to support their existence, they die. Endowment does not discourage this, and is fine with her Breath being used to feed the Returned.
They can also choose to bestow their Divine Breath upon others, which typically results in a massive feat of power, often tied to healing, though it will kill the Returned. Giving up their Divine Breath is often the reason they were Returned in the first place -- a potential Returned is shown a vision of the future by Endowment, and chooses to come back based on that, although the memory of it fades away until it is needed.

### The Tears of Edgli
For more information, see [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]].
The [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] are a special flower that grows only in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], near Endowment's [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]]. They come in a variety of colors and make for extremely good dyes; they are also more efficient when used as a source of color for [[Awakening\|Awakening]]. This is because, having grown near the perpendicularity, the Tears contain some of Endowment's Investiture seeping out of the ground.

### Other
Endowment has some capacity to perceive the future and bestow those visions upon others; she communes with people as a disembodied voice to do so. She also has the ability to smite people on her planet. Perhaps related to this, she appears to have keen awareness of who enters and leaves Nalthis; she can detect [[Hoid\|Hoid's]] presence while other [[Shards\|Shards]] have trouble spotting him on their own worlds.

## History
 by  Heatherly  Endowment ignoring [[Hoid\|Hoid]]
>“*If Rayse becomes an issue, he will be dealt with. And so will you.*”
\-Endowment to Hoid[4]


Like all [[Shard\|Shards]], Endowment was created at the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and contains one sixteenth of him. The people present at the Shattering agreed to go separate ways after taking their Shards. And so, when Endowment was picked up by [[Edgli\|Edgli]], she took it from [[Yolen\|Yolen]] and eventually settled on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
Millennia later, the people of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]] landed on the shores of the land that now houses [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. It was then that Endowment first created a Returned in [[Vo\|Vo]], who managed to have five Visions and father a child before dying a week later. From then on out, Returned began appearing in other parts of the world. Among others, Endowment Returned the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]], including [[Vasher\|Vasher]] and [[Shashara\|Shashara]], who together created [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], and [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]], who saved the Hallandren from a continent-wide war by restoring the power of the god-king.
Around the time of [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], [[Hoid\|Hoid]] began contacting various Shards in an attempt to build a resistance to [[Odium\|Odium]], which was then held by [[Rayse\|Rayse]]. Endowment, still annoyed at the Vessels who chose to settle down in pairs in violation of the original pact, declined. Believing Rayse to be of little concern, she chided Hoid for dabbling in matters far outside his scope, and suggested that if Odium were to become an issue, he would be dealt with promptly -- as would Hoid himself.
Some time later, [[Harmony\|Harmony]] contacted Endowment at Hoid's behest. She was willing to communicate, though it's unknown what she told him.

## Influence
>“*By the Colors!*”
\-Nalthian expression[16]


 by  Heatherly Despite being Nalthis' only Shard, the planet's inhabitants seem by and large unaware of her existence, even through religion. Of the known cultures, only the [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] have any knowledge of her; and even then, she is known only as the voice that brings back the Returned. While the people of [[Idris\|Idris]] are monotheistic, their god, [[Austre\|Austre]], is not based on Endowment.
Regardless, she is capable of influencing Nalthis through her Returned. She communicates with select few dead as a disembodied voice, and presents them with chosen visions of the future before asking them to Return and act on this vision. Although the Returned come back amnesiac, their memories do come back when needed. Through this, Endowment can indirectly steer the course of history; most notably, Returning [[Vo\|Vo]] caused the creation of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] and Returning [[Shashara\|Shashara]] led to the creation of [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]]. Endowment also had some additional level of involvement in Nightblood's creation, above simply her Investiture being used.
Despite her involvement in Nalthis, Endowment appears to be uninterested in reaching beyond the planet and meddling with the greater [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].

## Trivia
If Brandon were to become a Vessel, Endowment is one of the Shards he has said he might choose.
In *The Well of Ascension*'s original ending, Endowment was one of many Shards which saved [[Sazed\|Sazed]] from [[Marsh\|Marsh]].
In *Magic: The Gathering* colors, Endowment would be mono-green.
