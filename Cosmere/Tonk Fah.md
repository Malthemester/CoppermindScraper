## Appearance and Personality
Superficially Tonk Fah can appear to be a funny, somewhat simple, but good-natured mercenary, who likes to nap and eat.
In reality, he is a sociopath and sadist who works with [[Denth\|Denth]] as a thug; left to his own devices he'd be a serial killer. He is "large of girth" and carries a cudgel strapped to his back. He is less groomed than Denth.
He keeps a succession of exotic pets, which he secretly tortures and kills when the urge takes him. It takes [[Denth\|Denth]] a large effort to have him re-focus his attention to animals instead of humans.

## Attributes and Abilities
Tonk Fah is a capable warrior and extremely strong. He takes on five Lifeless when fleeing the raid in the slums and even incapacitates two as they try to kill Vivenna. Both of these abilities seem to be enhanced by his great size.
Tonk Fah also has the uncanny ability to fall asleep at a moments notice.

## History
 by  Imaginative Joy  With [[Denth\|Denth]]
When [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] arrives in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]], Tonk Fah and his companion Denth intercept her as she goes to meet [[Lemex\|Lemex]], the Idrian spymaster in the town. He helps convince her with his casual, somewhat jovial style that he is a simplistic and misunderstood mercenary. He appears to be eager to please and quite diligent in carrying out orders.
Tonk Fah and Denth were employed by Lemex in support of [[Vahr\|Vahr's]] rebellion, but were secretly poisoning him. Upon his death, Tonk Fah discreetly disposed of Lemex's body. Later, he helps ransack Lemex's home in search of his valuables and plans and helps guard Vivenna while she meets with Idrian slum lords . Behind the scenes, Tonk Fah has already killed at least three Idrian soldiers sent to retrieve [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] from [[Lemex\|Lemex's]] ransacked house.
After [[Parlin\|Parlin]] was tortured and killed by Tonk Fah , [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] escapes into the streets. During her escape attempt she first tries to awaken Tonk Fah's cloak, but due to a bad command this does not work; she instead uses [[Clod\|Clod's]] lifeless command as a distraction. While starving on the streets, [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] sees that the first soup kitchen she goes to is being watched by Tonk Fah, and thus she avoids going to any of soup kitchens even while on the verge of death.
After [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] sneaks into the [[Court of the Gods\|Court of the Gods]] in order to help free [[Vasher\|Vasher]] with the guidance of [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], she comes across [[Denth\|Denth]] torturing [[Vasher\|Vasher]], with Tonk Fah idly sleeping with his back against the wall. [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] uses an Awakened rope to strangle Tonk Fah, which distracts [[Denth\|Denth]] as he moves to help Tonk Fah escape the binding.
While Tonk Fah keeps an eye on [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] during the duel between [[Denth\|Denth]] and [[Vasher\|Vasher]], she realizes that he was still wearing the same cloak she had placed her [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]] into. She uses this to distract [[Denth\|Denth]].
After [[Denth\|Denth]] is killed by [[Vasher\|Vasher]], Tonk Fah takes his money and escapes with [[Jewels\|Jewels]].

## Relationships
He is in a mercenary band with [[Denth\|Denth]], and [[Jewels\|Jewels]], and [[Clod\|Clod]].
As a part of [[Denth's crew\|Denth's crew]], Tonk Fah temporarily pretends to be employed by and allied with Vivenna. In reality he is in the employ of [[Bluefingers\|Bluefingers]].
He is not fond of Jewels.
