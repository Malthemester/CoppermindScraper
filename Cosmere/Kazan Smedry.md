## Appearance and Personality
Kazan is described as having a wide face with a broad chin and dark, curly hair. He wears rugged clothing, and is about four feet tall. He tends to go by the nickname Kaz.
He acts as a guide for the group, and like most Smedrys, he enjoys going on adventures and doing dangerous things. Kazan does not like being referred to by his height, though he keeps an extensive [[The List\|list]] of reasons why short people are better than tall people.

## Attributes and Abilities
Like all Smedrys, Kazan has a Smedry Talent. His talent is getting lost and is a space Talent on the [[Smedry Talent\|Incarnate Wheel]]. This allows him to effectively transport himself and whoever follows him to another place, but it may take weeks to get to the destination. The Talent is easier to activate if he is already lost, but would have limitations when he is at places that are unlikely to get lost. Parallels are made to [[Transporter's Glass\|Transporter's Glass]].
Kaz is also able to use Warrior's lenses and can pilot [[Silimatic\|silimatic]] vehicles. Additionally, he is a prominent scholar of arcane theory and is thus very knowledgeable about Smedry Talents and the [[Incarna\|Incarna]]. He is the first person to teach [[Alcatraz\|Alcatraz]] about the Incarnate Wheel.

## Relationships
Kazan's father is Leavenworth Smedry, and the two are very close, sharing an affectionate bond. Both enjoy needling each other over their reckless tendencies. Kaz even says that he knows Leavenworth better than anyone else.
Kazan also seems close to his brother Atticaâ€”Attica greets him enthusiastically upon their reunion in the [[Library of Alexandria\|Library of Alexandria]], and Kaz speaks of Attica and his accomplishments with admiration. However, Kaz has also called Attica an idiot and admits his brother isn't perfect.
In addition, Kaz seems to be the only one of the Smedrys to view [[Shasta\|Shasta]] with anything other than distrust. Though he believed it was foolish for Attica to marry her, he thinks they did truly love each other and that she wasn't the worst of [[Librarian\|Librarians]].
Kaz initially dislikes his nephew Alcatraz due to a social faux pas Alcatraz makes when they first meet, but the two eventually develop a good relationship. Alcatraz comes to Kaz for advice about his theories on Smedry Talents and the Incarna, and confides his anxieties about his parents, while Kaz is a helpful and supportive figure for him.

## Trivia
His name is a reference to a defunct Russian  in .
