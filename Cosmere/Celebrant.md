## Geography
Celebrant is located on the western side of the island counterpart to the [[Sea of Spears\|Sea of Spears]] in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. Angerspren roam the region outside the city.

## Landmarks
>‚Äú*At Celebrant, the moneychangers have perfect gemstones that can hold the light indefinitely... They use devices to transfer it from smaller gemstones to their perfect ones. Then they give you credit to spend in the city.*‚Äù
\-Ico describing Celebrant to Kaladin[6]

Celebrant is organized in a similar fashion to that of a human city, though not as densely populated, with a market and docks. There are towers in the center of the city used to tell the time by a set of fires that burn in vertical holes. The buildings are each constructed of a variety of materials, like differently colored bricks or different types of stone. These materials may be manifested from physical objects.
The city keeps a store of sand that can be used to put out fires when required. Due to Shadesmar's lack of water, this may be the main purpose of such a store.

### Docks
The docks are longer than the city itself, to accommodate for its status as a trading hub. Ships are made to berth along stone piers, where braces beneath the sea of spheres support the vessels after their [[Mandras\|mandras]] have been taken away. Rows of long warehouses mark the shore along the docks, obscuring a view of the city.
The dock registrar, housed in a blue-painted building, is run by a cultivationspren who manages inspections as well as keeping record of docked ships and their travel arrangements. Although they keep track of which ships take passengers, they do not record which ships are friendly to humans and will offer them travel. Humans looking for sea passage must speak to ships individually to enquire whether they have suitable accomodations. Ship inspections are performed at first hour everyday and normally only take thirteen minutes.
Adjacent moneychanger, [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] can be traded for notes of exchange.

### Market
>‚Äú*Even in comparison to the improvised market of Urithiru, this seemed‚Ä¶ ephemeral to Kaladin. But there were no stormwinds to worry about here, so it probably made sense.*‚Äù
\-Kaladin's observations on the Celebrant markets[3]


The market is comprised mostly of open stalls with goods piled on tables. There are stalls that sell clothing, building materials, weapons, food, and art. The prices, based largely on the item's permanence in Shadesmar, differ greatly from those of items in the Physical Realm. Most food is typically sold in cans. One art store offers artwork for sale from places as far off as [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. Another store has an incredibly expensive silver chain that comes from [[Threnody\|Threnody]]. Haggling appears to be acceptable within the Celebrant marketplace.

## History
Celebrant used to be a free city state, though it was taken over by [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. However, they didn't have firm control over the city, being present mostly through a few [[Fused\|Fused]] officials.
In Nan 1174 [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]], [[Pattern\|Pattern]], and [[Azure\|Azure]] passed through Celebrant after getting stuck in Shadesmar following the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]. The group arrived on a ship captained by [[Ico\|Ico]]. They purchased clothing, weapons, and food in the market. Shallan sought passage on ships heading toward [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] or [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], but the group was ultimately forced to leave swiftly aboard *Honor's Path*, pursued by Fused.

## Culture
>‚Äú*They seem to wear whatever. That‚Äôs an Alethi officer‚Äôs coat over an Azish scribe‚Äôs vest. Tashikki wrap worn with trousers, and there‚Äôs almost a full Thaylen tlmko, but they‚Äôre missing the boots.*‚Äù
\-Adolin commenting on the fashion of the spren[3]

Celebrant is a melting pot of [[Spren\|spren]], with many different kinds of true spren living within the city, including [[Cultivationspren\|cultivationspren]], [[Ashspren\|ashspren]], [[Peakspren\|peakspren]], [[Reacher\|Reachers]], [[Inkspren\|inkspren]], and [[Cryptic\|Cryptics]]. There are also spren made out of smoke (who may be [[Mistspren\|mistspren]]). Spren children can be found in the city, but are rare. Humans and honorspren are very rare and tend to draw attention. Some spren that can be found in Celebrant are overly hostile towards humans.
Fashion among the spren is eclectic--drawing from human styles across all of Roshar.
Wanted posters of Syl are displayed in the city.

## Economy
Like all of Shadesmar, Celebrant uses Stormlight for currency. Due to Stormlight fading quickly while in the Cognitive Realm, Celebrant employs moneylenders who will exchange notes for renewed spheres. The Stormlight is then transferred to perfect gemstones where it will remain indefinitely without fading.

## Politics
>‚Äú*How could you neglect to point out that Voidspren ruled the city?*‚Äù
\-Shallan berating the dock registrar.[3]


Celebrant was a free city until voidspren took partial control of it in the initial months of the True Desolation. Some city officials are voidspren, while the rest pledge compliance. Two Fused, including [[Kyril\|Kyril]], visit the city on occasion to perform inspections.
Though the spren have generally accepted this, some quietly oppose [[Odium\|Odium's]] rule.

## Trivia
*Oathbringer* chapter 102 is titled "Celebrant."
In the *Oathbringer* beta, Kaladin met the [[Ire\|Ire]] in Celebrant where he became convinced he needed to reach [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]. This scene was moved in the final version to occur in [[Riino's lighthouse\|Riino's lighthouse]], to strengthen Kaladin's motivations and to make the later story more enjoyable.
