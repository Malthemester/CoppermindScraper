**Mintez** is an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] highlord on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
Mintez works as Aladar's bodyguard and often wears Highprince [[Aladar\|Aladar's]] [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], as Aladar himself was better as a general not a warrior. Mintez accompanied Aladar's forces on Dalinar's expedition to the center of the Shattered Plains. He was present for the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], although he did not wear Aladar's Shardplate in that fight. Mintez survived that battle and was teleported to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with the other soldiers when [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] engaged the Oathgate. He continued serving as Aladar's bodyguard there, including accompanying the highprince to a meeting on the fortification of [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] in Urithiru's Gallery of Maps wearing the full Plate.
