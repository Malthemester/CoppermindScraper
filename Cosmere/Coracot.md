A **coracot** is a fearsome creature that is hunted in the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Trademaster [[Vstim\|Vstim]] gained the respect of the residents of [[Relu-na\|Relu-na]] in his youth by slaying a coracot by himself during an expedition with some hunters. This feat was impressive, especially for a foreigner, causing the Reshi to trust him enough to trade with him.
