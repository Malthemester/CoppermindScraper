 by  Isaac Stewart  Plans of the palace's main level
The Palace is located in the northern portion of the city of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], atop a large plateau. 
The main building of the palace stands between the Monastery Dais and the Sunmaker Park. The main entrance leads to twin ballrooms - presumably, a separate one for men and for women. Both ballrooms have access to the garden that forms the northern side of the palace. Directly adjacent to the Grand Entry are the palace garrison and the guest quarters. From the latter, one may reach the Eastern Gallery and through it, the Sunwalk, which leads to the Monastery Dais.
The lower floors of the palace have broad and wide corridors. The palace basements house the unloading docks, used to transport cargo to and from the palace plateau. The upper floors are narrow and cavernous. The royal quarters are located there.


The Monastery Dais is a large, almost perfectly circular platform near the main building, and may be technically considered part of the palace complex. As its name indicates, it houses the Kholinar ardentia. Notable features include the King's Chapel and a room with eleven lanterns. The ardents believe that the lanterns represent the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]], with the last one marking the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]].
In actuality, the room is the Kholinar [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] chamber, and the entire dais is the Oathgate platform.


The People's Hall is a separate building within the palace complex. It's a large, open-air structure sitting in the shadow of the palace. In contrast to other parts of the complex, it is open to the public, as it is from there that the reigning monarch can address the common people of the city. It also holds a dais with the **Common Throne**, where the king or queen sits while making pronouncements. It is there that [[Pai\|Pai]] chooses to write her denouncement of [[Aesudan Kholin\|Aesudan Kholin]].


The Beggars' Porch is a small patio in the back of the palace gardens, so named because the city's homeless often come there, hoping for some charity from the royal family. During the time between [[Evi\|Evi]] and [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] deaths, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] would visit it often to get alcohol from the beggars, as his family would hide it from him. It was also there that the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] could be found, under the nickname Ahu. Whether the Porch still remains in this capacity after Gavilar's death is unclear.


The catacombs are located in the depths of the palace. They can be reached through the eastern wing, by the same passage that leads into the kitchens and the Beggars' Porch. It's a stone structure composed of long corridors, with a central chamber spacious enough to hold several dozen people, lit with real fires rather than spherelight. Funerals for the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] of House Kholin take place there, and their bodies, [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] to stone, are placed upright along the walls of both the main chamber and the tunnels surrounding it.

## Palace Guard and Queen's Guard
The Kholinar Palace has two forces tasked with protecting it: the **Palace Guard** and the **Queen's Guard**. The Palace Guard is responsible for protecting both the palace and the city of Kholinar, while the Queen's Guard is responsible for protecting the queen and the royal heir, who in the current times are [[Aesudan Kholin\|Aesudan]] and [[Gavinor Kholin\|Gavinor Kholin]].
Due to the actions of Queen Aesudan, the Queen's Guard has been corrupted either during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|siege of Kholinar]] or shortly before that by the forces of Odium. Aesudan refers to them as her "Knights Radiant".

## History
It is unclear when the palace was built. Prior to the [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] war of Alethi unification, it was held by a different branch of his [[House Kholin\|family]]. After he and his brother [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] conquered it, it became their seat of power. After Gavilar's crowning, the palace became the seat of the government of united [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].
King Gavilar was murdered in the palace by [[Szeth\|Szeth]] during a peace celebration with the [[Listeners\|Listeners]]. Following that, his descendant, king [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar]], moved to the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], so as to be closer to the fighting there. Queen Aesudan - and, later, prince Gavinor - remained at the Palace, along with the widowed queen [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]], as Aesudan was managing the kingdom in her husband's absence.
At some point after Navani left for the Shattered Plains, the palace came under the influence of the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Ashertmarn\|Ashertmarn]]. This caused the queen to begin acting increasingly erratically, throwing food away to rot, hosting excessively lavish parties and losing interest in ruling Alethkar. The situation came to a peak when ardent [[Pai\|Pai]] was executed for publicly denouncing this new lifestyle, causing wide-spread riots in the city.
After the riots, the queen recalled her guard into the palace, and appears to have fallen fully under the influence of both Ashertmarn and [[Yelig-Nar\|Yelig-Nar]]. Anyone to enter the palace would never return, either killed by the Queen's Guard or subsumed by Ashertmarn, while the spren of the Oathgate beneath the Monastery Dais were subverted by [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]]. During that period, the [[Cult of Moments\|Cult of Moments]] held feasts in the Monastery Dais. A portion of the Palace Guard resisted the lure of the Unmade and were locked in a room. After their release, they claimed that time seemed to pass differently for them, feeling it has only been a few days, not a few weeks, since the riots.
The strike team led by [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] tried and failed to re-take the Palace from the queen. After the king's death and Kholinar's fall, the [[Fused\|Fused]] appear to have made the Palace the centre of their operations in the city, and began to dig it out from under the rubble in search of the [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] that was supposed to bond Elhokar. Its further fate is unknown so far.
