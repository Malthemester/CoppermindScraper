>“*I am being chased. Your friends of the Seventeenth Shard, I suspect. I believe they're still lost, following a false trail I left for them. They'll be happier that way. I doubt they have any inkling what to do with me should they actually catch me.*”
\-The Letter[2]

## Beliefs and Objectives
Its members have a non-interventionist philosophy, believing that the Shards were split up for a reason and that people shouldn't dabble in mixing them. The organization's name was very deliberately chosen. They watch the planets of the cosmere but do not approve of getting involved with or assimilating into another planet's society. They believe interfering will merely exacerbate the conflicts between the Shards. While they have goals beyond chasing down [[Hoid\|Hoid]], those goals are not yet known.

## History
### Roshar
Despite their non-interventionist policy, members of the Seventeenth Shard accidentally brought the common cold to Roshar.
In the Rosharan year 1173, [[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] the [[Purelake\|Purelaker]] was acting as a guide and informant to three members of the Seventeenth Shard who were looking for [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. Ishikk does not know they are [[Worldhoppers\|worldhoppers]] or even their names, though he nicknames them *Grump*, *Thinker*, and *Blunt*. By 1175, the group had given up on finding Hoid and had left [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

Grump has the distinct linguistic pattern of [[Dula\|Dulas]] from [[Sel\|Sel]] and is the [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] [[Galladon\|Galladon]].
Thinker has a scar across his scalp and is [[Demoux\|Demoux]] from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Blunt is [[Baon\|Baon]] from [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
