If the emperor does not emerge after his 100-day mourning period, the rule of the Heritage Faction will be forfeit and the empire will fall into chaos.Shai is given an impossible task: to create - to Forge - a new soul for the emperor in less than 100 days. But her soul-Forgery is considered an abomination by her captors. She is confined to a tiny, dirty chamber, guarded by a man who hates her, spied upon by politicians, and trapped behind a door sealed in her own blood. Shai's only possible ally is the emperor's most loyal councillor, Gaotona, who struggles to understand her true talent.Time is running out for Shai. Forging, while deducing the motivations of her captors, she needs a perfect plan to escape...*”
\-Blurb from Victor Gollancz Ltd[2]


>“*Shai is a Forger, a foreigner who can flawlessly copy and re-create any item by rewriting its history with skillful magic. Though condemned to death after trying to steal the emperor's scepter, she is given one opportunity to save herself. Despite the fact that her skill as a Forger is considered an abomination by her captors, Shai will attempt to create a new soul for the emperor, who is almost dead from the attack of assassins.Delving deeply into his life, she discovers Emperor Ashravan's truest nature—and the opportunity to exploit it. Her only possible ally is one who is truly loyal to the emperor, but councillor Gaotona must overcome his prejudices to understand that her forgery is as much artistry as it is deception.Skillfully deducing the machinations of her captors, Shai needs a perfect plan to escape.*
\-The fate of the kingdom lies in one impossible task.

## Setting
The book is set in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], taking place in the same [[Sel\|world]] as [[Elantris (book)\|Elantris]], though in a very different region and without any of the characters from Elantris, apart from [[Hoid\|Hoid]], who is the Imperial Fool and mentioned several times, though he never appears in-person. It tells the story of a woman named [[Shai\|Shai]], a thief and a [[Forger\|Forger]]; or person capable of rewriting the pasts of objects in order to change their present.

## Easter Eggs
Hoid was written into the original prologue, as the Imperial Fool who set up Shai to be caught stealing the Sceptre. The scene was removed due to Brandon's alpha readers not liking it.
The god which Shai worships has some relevance to the whole [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].

## Postscript
*Note: the Postscript is found in Arcanum Unbounded, a collection of Cosmere stories.*

Brandon began forming ideas for "The Emperor's Soul" during a trip to the National Palace Museum in Taiwan. The *tojang*, or red  that adorned much of the artwork, stood out to him. In addition to the stamps of the artists who created the work, scholars and nobility who particularly liked the work would add their stamp to it, as well. From these stamps came the idea of Soulstamps, capable of rewriting the nature of an object's existence.
