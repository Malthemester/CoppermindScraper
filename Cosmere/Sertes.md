**Sertes** is a captain in the [[Luthadel Garrison\|Luthadel Garrison]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].

## Appearance and Personality
He wears the uniform of the garrison, with additional stripes and epaulettes denoting his rank. He trusts [[Ham\|Ham]], and does not notice when Ham reacts oddly to some military intelligence.

## History
On the day of the battle of [[Holstep\|Holstep]], Ham and [[Vin\|Vin]] visited the garrison seeking information about the army's current activities. Ham asked for Sertes, whom he was friendly with; the two men had sparred together in the past. Sertes, who was recently promoted to captain, tried to recruit Ham, offering him an officer position with his own squad. He revealed to Ham that the garrison would be marching north in a few hours in support of the Holstep and [[Valtroux\|Valtroux]] garrisons, who were fighting a large group of rebel [[Skaa\|skaa]] that were based in the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]]. This was the first time that members of [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] learned of [[Yeden\|Yeden's]] foolhardy actions exposing the rebel army, and Ham was barely able to hide his shock. Ham told Sertes that he would enlist in the garrison, although he had no intentions of actually doing so.
