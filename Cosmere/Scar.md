## Description
The Scar is a region of stars that are unusually bright. In a cosmere star chart that was commissioned by an unknown patron, the Scar includes a constellation known as "The Dragon". Most of the stars in the Scar have a red tint on the chart, and are perceived as red when viewed from several planets, unlike other stars. The color is significant, but the reason why is not yet known.
The apparent shape of the Scar varies depending on the vantage point in the cosmere; it is not always visible on every planet. This is due to the positioning of the various planetary systems as well as local factors such as mist or ash.

## Local Names and Observations
### Threnody
>“*The Forests felt... dark this night. The light of the Starbelt above didn’t seem to filter through the branches as well as it should.*”
\-Silence Montane[12]


On [[Threnody\|Threnody]], the Scar is known as the **Starbelt**. Threnody has no moon, making the nights extremely dark; the Starbelt is usually bright enough to faintly illuminate objects, even when its light is filtered by tree branches. Threnody may lie relatively close to the Scar, as [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]] implies that the Starbelt's position in the sky changes on a day-to-day basis. The residents of Threnody do not describe the Starbelt's light as red; the star at the center of the Threnodite system also appears to be red which may affect their perception of the Scar.

### Roshar
>“*The crimson eyes hovered like Taln's Scar - like spheres in the darkness, deeper in color than any ruby.*”
\-Dalinar Kholin's perception of Stormform Parshendi eyes[14]


Most [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] people refer to the Scar as **Taln's Scar**, named for the [[Herald\|Herald]] known as [[Taln\|Taln]]. Taln's Scar is described as deep red in color, and it changes position in different seasons. It is visible before the sun sets and other twinkling white stars (accompanied by [[Starspren\|starspren]]) appear. [[Reya\|Reya's]] [[Tear\|Tear]] is another notably bright star in the sky, but it is not part of Taln's Scar. Roshar has three moons that rise and set during the night; between moons, the stars provide adequate illumination for someone to move around but not quite enough to read or draw. The position of Taln's scar on one's seventh birthday is relevant in Rosharan astrology.

### Scadrial

In [[Classical Scadrial\|Classical Scadrial]], no mention is made of any unusually bright stars or constellations, even when [[Sazed\|Sazed]] discusses an astronomically-aware people known as the [[Nelazan\|Nelazan]]. During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], the sky was largely obscured by [[Mist\|mist]] and the [[Ashmounts\|ashmounts]], to the point that even an [[Allomancer\|allomancer]] burning [[Tin\|tin]] could not always see the stars, with the exception of tin [[Savant\|savants]]. [[Vin\|Vin]] is able to see the stars by using tin or by using [[Steel\|steel]] to fly above the mists. She is able to see some of the same stars that would be in the sky of Threnody, but still does not take note of anything that resembles the Scar. It is possible that [[Luthadel\|Luthadel's]] orientation at the north pole of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during this era was such that the Scar was not visible.


>“*The mists were out, curling around outside, though the skyscraper was tall enough he thought he could see stars and the Red Rip through that mist.*”
\-Waxillium Ladrian[26]


During the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], [[Harmony\|Harmony]] moves Scadrial back to its original orientation and orbit. Hundreds of years later, [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] sees a celestial phenomenon known as the **Red Rip** on several occasions, although he seems to view it as mundane. The Red Rip is not described in detail, but it is prominent on cloudless nights, and sometimes sits low on the horizon. It is bright enough that it can sometimes be seen through the mists when they are present if observed at high enough elevation. When Wax is temporarily dead, Harmony shows him a seemingly troublesome red haze that is enveloping Scadrial, but this haze is not necessarily related to the Red Rip.
