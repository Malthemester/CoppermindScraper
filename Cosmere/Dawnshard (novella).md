## Cover Synopsis
*When a ghost ship is discovered, its crew presumed dead after trying to reach the storm-shrouded island Akinah, Navani Kholin must send an expedition to make sure the island hasn’t fallen into enemy hands. Knights Radiant who fly too near find their Stormlight suddenly drained, so the voyage must be by sea.*
*Shipowner Rysn Ftori lost the use of her legs but gained the companionship of Chiri-Chiri, a Stormlight-ingesting winged larkin, a species once thought extinct. Now Rysn’s pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri’s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed Windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani’s quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.*

## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[Dawnshard (novella)/Summary\|/Summary]].
[[Yalb\|Yalb]] serves aboard a Thaylen ship at sea as it discovers the *First Dreams* returning from [[Aimia\|Aimia]] without its crew.
[[Rysn\|Rysn]] decides to travel to to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with her porter [[Nikli\|Nikli]] to meet with [[Navani\|Navani]] to discuss the terms of an expedition to [[Aimia\|Aimia]] - she seeks a cure for [[Chiri-Chiri\|Chiri-Chiri]] who has taken ill, [[Queen Fen\|Queen Fen]] seeks an answer to the disappearance of the *First Dreams* crew, and [[Navani\|Navani]] seeks information about the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] on [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. Agreeable terms are met, including the addition of [[Lopen\|Lopen]], [[Huio\|Huio]], and [[Rushu\|Rushu]] to the expedition and the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail]] departs.
During the voyage, several "omens" manifest which unnerve the crew and threaten [[Rysn\|Rysn's]] position as [[Rebsk\|rebsk]]. She manages to take charge and keep the mission afloat. During downtime, [[Huio\|Huio]] stumbles upon a discovery regarding the behavior of [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] in the presence of [[Aluminum\|aluminum]], which leads [[Rushu\|Rushu]] to create a fabrial assisted mobility device for [[Rysn\|Rysn]].
The omens are revealed to have been caused by [[Nikli\|Nikli]], one of the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]], in an attempt to keep humanity from discovering the secrets of [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. [[Nikli\|Nikli]] is removed from the ship by [[Lopen\|Lopen]] and [[Huio\|Huio]], and the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail]] breaches a strange storm around [[Akinah\|Akinah]] to make landfall. Once ashore, [[Lopen\|Lopen]] and [[Rushu\|Rushu]] set off to find the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] while the crew goes ashore to collect a hoard of [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] that have seemingly been left on the shore by dying [[Greatshell\|greatshells]].
The [[Sleepless\|Sleepless's]] final trap is realized by [[Lopen\|Lopen]] and [[Rushu\|Rushu]], but they are too late to stop [[Nikli\|Nikli]] from reappearing aboard and a large hordeling from appearing to attack the crew. [[Cord\|Cord]] and [[Rysn\|Rysn]] jump overboard and find their way to caves beneath [[Akinah\|Akinah]]. In the cave is a number of soulcasters, a set of shardplate, and a mural depicting the shattering of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. The mural contains a [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]], which leaves to bond with [[Rysn\|Rysn]] as [[Nikli\|Nikli]] appears with two other [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]].
Negotiations in the cave commence while [[Huio\|Huio]] and [[Lopen\|Lopen]] fight the hordeling above. [[Huio\|Huio]] swears the Third Ideal to protect [[Lopen\|Lopen]] when the latter's stormlight is drained by another hordeling. [[Rysn\|Rysn]] bargains for the crew's lives and safe passage home in exchange for a promise to keep the secret of Aimia's treasure of soulcasters and shardplate. [[Nikli\|Nikli]] reveals that Rysn has become a Dawnshard, and the trade talks take a turn. The Sleepless permit the *Wandersail* to leave and Rysn to remain bonded to the Dawnshard. In exchange, an elaborate cover story is created to mask the true contents of the Aimia cave and the Dawnshard's location, while the Sleepless get to stay at Rysn's side as protectors of the Dawnshard.
As the *Wandersail* returns to [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]], [[Rysn\|Rysn]] begins to notice the passive effects of the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard's]] power and [[Lopen\|Lopen]] swears his own Third Ideal.

## Development
Brandon originally intended to call the novella *Wandersail* after the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|ship]] that [[Vstim\|Vstim]] had given Rysn and upon which she would be sailing. However, he decided to change it to prevent confusion with the *Wandersail* that [[Hoid\|Wit]] told a story about, and to reserve *Wandersail* as a title for a potential picture book.
Brandon decided to write and publish *Dawnshard* prior to the release of *Rhythm of War* because Aimia has relevance to the story and Rysn was the character best able to go there, presumably because of her newly acquired ship.
Brandon had planned to use [[Lopen\|Lopen]] as a secondary viewpoint character. Lopen and [[Huio\|Huio]] will both have character arcs in the novella.

## Trivia
The cover of the novella depicts the exoskeleton of a [[Larkin\|larkin]].
The prologue from the first draft was sent in Brandon's newsletter on August 6, 2020.
