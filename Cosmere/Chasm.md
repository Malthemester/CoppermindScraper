**The Chasm** is a major geographical feature of the [[Arelon\|Arelon]] region of the planet [[Sel\|Sel]].
The chasm was the cause of the Reod. The chasm came about by unnatural events.
Because the chasm changed the landscape of Arelon significantly, it also changed how [[Aon\|Aons]] needed to be drawn.
The chasm is unlikely to have been caused by [[Odium\|Odium's]] visit to Sel. The Reod occurred about ten years before the restoration of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], while Odium's visit came far earlier than that (at least several centuries, as [[Seon\|seons]] did not exist before Odium appeared).
