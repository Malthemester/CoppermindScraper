**Remark** is a cadet in either [[Inkwell Flight\|Inkwell Flight]] or [[Firestorm Flight\|Firestorm Flight]] who is offered a [[Scout\|scout]] position prior to graduation. As a scout he would fly a [[Val-class\|Val-class]] ship. It is unclear whether Remark is a callsign or this cadet's name.
He is boisterous and has a bowl cut. He is excited to join the scouts after graduating from [[Flight School\|Flight School]] and talks with the other cadets about his offer during dinner in the mess hall.
The current status of Remark is unknown, however, if he did graduate he may have been one of the twelve scouts combined into a single Flight during the [[Second Battle of Alta\|Second Battle of Alta]]. As three quarters of this Flight were killed during the fight, he may now be dead.
