## Appearance and Personality
Refractionary wears yellow and black clothing.
Refractionary likes to be involved in action, and thus will stay close to the Enforcement officers under her, in case she must give them orders or make illusions. As with most Epics, Refractionary does not care for human life. When she was cut off in traffic, she created an illusion of the road turning, so the offender drove off the highway and into a house. Six died from this incident, including children.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Epic Powers


### Weakness
Refractionary's weakness is smoke. She typically stays away from people smoking and fires in general.

## History
When [[David\|David]] was spotted during the murder of [[Fortuity\|Fortuity]] by a woman he pulled out of a car, Refractionary was sent to David's apartment with a sniper and three Enforcement officers (one of whom is [[Roy\|Roy]]). She used her illusions to conceal the three Enforcers in a large trash bin, and a sniper on top of a playground tower. However, David saw the illusions due to their occasional shimmer, and was alerted to her presence.
When the Enforcers followed David into his apartment, Refractionary attempted to sneak up on Megan and [[Cody\|Cody]] from behind. However, Refractionary only kept her mobile on vibrate, and so when David called her mobile, it alerted Megan to Refractionary's position. Megan then immediately shot Refractionary, killing her.

## Trivia
Refractionary leads someone who cut her off in traffic off the road, because they inconvenienced her. This is remarkably similar to how Brandon developed the idea for the Reckoners series as a whole. He was late to a book signing, and when someone cut him off, he remarked that they were very lucky he didn't have superpowers and blow up their car for inconveniencing him.
