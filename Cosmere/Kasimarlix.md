**Kasimarlix** is a Prime from the [[Makabak\|Makabak]] region of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] presents [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin's]] treatise *Verdict* to a number of [[Azish\|Azish]] [[Vizier\|viziers]] and scholars. The Azish are stunned by Jasnah's eloquence; among other impressive writing techniques, she analyzes a single quote from Prime Kasimarlix in three different stages, "each escalating the same quote to a different level of Superior Understanding". The reason for Kasimarlix's status as "Prime" is not clear; they may have been a [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]], but Prime is also used in other contexts in the region, such as [[Prime Kadasix\|Prime Kadasix]] and the Prime of [[Emul\|Emul]].
