The **Sterrion 36** is a handgun on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], crafted by [[Ranette\|Ranette]] for [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]].
The Sterrion is a double action, six chamber  with an unadorned steel-alloy frame. It is not fancy, with an un-exotic grip, but is reliable with tight tolerances and no play in the cylinder. It is capable of shooting large-caliber bullets. The barrel is long and hard to conceal, meant to be carried in a side holster as opposed to under the arm. As a lawman in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], Wax typically carried two and wielded them at the same time. After moving back to [[Elendel\|Elendel]] from the Roughs, Wax placed them in storage along with his shotgun and mistcoat. Wax was able to recover the pistols with some assistance from [[Harmony\|Harmony]] during his raid on the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] hideout.
