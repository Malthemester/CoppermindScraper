4 Notes


## Occupation
He is steward and companion of the explorer [[Jak\|Jak]] and follows him on his many adventures in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]. He is also the editor and annotator of the many short stories that Jak publishes in the [[Elendel Daily\|Elendel Daily]], a difficult job as he once had to remove sixteen superfluous commas from a single page, and Jak is under the impression that [[Koloss\|Koloss]] looks better when spelled Kol!oss. He has saved Jak's life many times.

## Personality
He is often separated from Jak in his adventures, leaving him skeptical as to whether the action as described by Jak actually took place. His annotations are often satirical and express doubt as to whether Jak's descriptions are accurate. He is annoyed at Jak for his terrible grammar and spelling and is extremely annoyed when people buy the stories without his editing. He believes that getting Jak to improve his writing is far more difficult than Jak's adventures in the Roughs. He left [[Elendel\|Elendel]] because the lack of intelligence among the Elendel public was driving him crazy. So, he could either leave or kill himself, the latter of which would violate his pacifist oaths.

## Feruchemy
He was apparently a [[Duralumin\|Connector]].
