**Ashlv** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] woman on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is a crewmember of the *Wind's Pleasure*, a ship captained by her husband,[[Tozbek\|Tozbek]].

## Appearance and Personality
Ashlv is a small woman with long white Thaylen eyebrows that she wears curled down to her cheeks. She is seen wearing a headscarf and a bright yellow blouse and skirt while aboard the ship.
When the sailors flirted with [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] and embarrassed her, Shallan suspects that Ashlv later admonished them. Other than this, she was a quiet presence.

## History
Ashlv worked on the cargo ship *Wind's Pleasure* with Tozbek and half a dozen other sailors. She and Tozbek usually shared the ship's largest cabin. She performed duties such as registering the ship when it made port. She was also aware that the ship's ledgers were not in good order, and shrewdly recruited Shallan to perform some scribing work in exchange for safe passage out of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]].
Tozbek was heard asking the thugs hired by the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] to spare Ashlv's life during their attack on the *Wind's Pleasure*, but her fate is unknown.
