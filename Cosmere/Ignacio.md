**Ignacio** is a former [[Aspect\|aspect]] of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds]].
He was skilled in chemistry and had died prior to the search for [[Razon's camera\|Razon's camera]], removing Stephen and his aspects' ability to know about chemistry in any significant detail. His death did not, however, remove Stephen's knowledge of biotech companies, despite Stephen's assumption that it would.
[[Justin\|Justin]] has also disappeared, presumably dying in a similar manner to Ignacio.
