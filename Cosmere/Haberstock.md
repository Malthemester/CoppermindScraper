>“*You'll get used to him, Nalizar. We keep having to throw the child out of our classes. He finds ways to sneak in and listen."*”

When [[Andrew Nalizar\|Andrew Nalizar]] began lecturing the other professors at the dinner after he challenged Professor [[Fitch\|Fitch]] and received his tenure, Professor Haberstock tried to convince Nalizar that his point had been made and that he didn't need to upset things further. Later that night, he noticed [[Joel Saxon\|Joel Saxon]] standing near the professors' dinner table, and warned Nalizar that Joel often tried to sneak into Rithmatics classes.
