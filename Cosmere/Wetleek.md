**Wetleek** is a plant whose sap is  under [[Abraham's Fire\|Abraham's Fire]].
The plant itself is a diuretic in horses, and it still retains its fluorescent properties in the expelled urine. When [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]] is hunting a bounty, she gives the bounty's horse water mixed with wetleek sap and follows their trail with the aid of glowpaste.
