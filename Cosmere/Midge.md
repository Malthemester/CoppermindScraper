**Midge** is a soldier in [[Elend\|Elend's]] army on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. He is one of the [[Mistfallen\|mistfallen]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is scruffy and somewhat unhinged. He is not a great soldier, as he falls asleep while on guard duty.

## History
When [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] was in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], he attempted to use Midge to communicate with [[Vin\|Vin]], as Midge's touch of madness allowed him to hear Kelsier while he slept. He tried to convince Midge to deliver a message to Vin about the corrupting influence of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] on anything that was not metal. Kelsier believed that Midge was just sane enough that people would not summarily dismiss him.
Kelsier thought his plan was working when he saw Midge talking to a group of soldiers. However, Midge was not delivering Kelsier's message, but rather claiming that the Survivor told him that he was "holy" and that the other soldiers should not be trusted. The other soldiers took offense, and a brawl broke out, led by [[Bilg\|Bilg]]. Kelsier realized that he needed to pursue a different method of getting a message to Vin; directly influencing people proved to be too difficult, especially when Ruin was watching him.
