**Identity** is a [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] attribute within the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] that demarcates one being from another for the purposes of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. It acts as a sort of spiritual DNA, and it functions together with [[Connection\|Connection]] in order to form a link to various forms of Investiture.

## Mechanics and interactions
Across the cosmere, use of magic is tied to the user's Identity, and power stored by one person is hard to access by a different person (though it is possible, albeit *extremely* unlikely, for two people to have matching Identity by chance). This restriction is the reason, for example, that [[BioChromatic Breath\|Breaths]] stored or [[Metalmind\|metalminds]] charged by one person cannot be used by anyone else. However, if someone "blanks" their Identity and stores power, it becomes easier for others to use that power (especially other blanked people, but potentially also non-blanked people, depending on the magic system).

### Feruchemy
In [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], Identity is stored in [[Aluminum\|aluminum]]. To effectively use aluminum, one must have Feruchemical access to at least one metal besides aluminum. By storing Identity in aluminum and then filling another metalmind, they create an "unkeyed" metalmind that can be used by any Feruchemist. One example is in [[The Bands of Mourning\|The Bands of Mourning]]: [[Wax\|Wax]] finds a gold bracelet filled with healing power that [[Wayne\|Wayne]], a gold Ferring, can access, Wax cannot. Through a method that has not yet been fully revealed, but which builds on unkeyed metalminds, it is also possible to create an [[Unsealed metalminds\|"unsealed" metalmind]] of [[Investiture\|investiture]], which *anyone* can use to access Feruchemical power; the [[Southern Scadrial\|Southern Scadrial]] medallions are an example.
As of [[Mistborn Era 2\|Mistborn Era 2]], the [[Kandra\|Kandra]] and the [[Terris\|Terris]] community have begun experimenting with Identity and the other spiritual aspects of Feruchemy, but still understand very little, owing to the rarity of the appropriate Ferrings and metals.

### Hemalurgy
In [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]], Identity can be stolen by a [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] spike.
Someone who has been granted Feruchemical abilities via Hemalurgy can access the metalminds of the Feruchemist whose abilities were stolen, presumably because they obtain some portion of the original person's Identity in the spike. If two people are spiked with spikes made from the same person, they will both be able to access the original person's metalminds, but not each other's, as their own Identity will interfere.
More generally, Hemalurgy can overwrite anything attached to the soul, including Identity.

### Awakening
Like with Feruchemy, Breaths that have been put into an object are keyed to the original Awakener's Identity, and so can only be reclaimed by that Awakener. However, when Breath is transferred directly from one person to another, the magic system automatically rekeys the Identity of the Breaths to that of the recipient, making Awakening the easiest of the magic systems to gain access to. Breaths used by an Awakener who has blanked their Identity can be retrieved by anyone, though Intent is required.

### Forgery
Storing Identity makes one more susceptible to being affected by many things in the cosmere, including [[Forgery\|Forgery]]. When a human is soulstamped, the transformation lasts a relatively short period of time, and the best crafted stamps last approximately a day. This is due to the fact that the Identity of a person, as opposed to an object, is constantly growing, changing and shifting.

### Lightweaving
There is a "pretty tenuous" link between Identity and the different personae that Shallan creates with Lightweaving.

### Singer forms
Identity and Connection are involved with the [[Singer\|singers]] ability to change forms. If a singers Identity and Connection is stolen, they will change into slaveform.

### Bonds
Forming a bond utilizes Identity and Connection in some manner. Lessening those attributes, such as by storing them in a metalmind, would affect the bond.

### Healing
Most healing in the cosmere works by using the three versions of the user's self; their Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual version. Healing typically heals the Physical version by matching it to their ideal Spiritual version, which is filtered through the lens of their minds (Cognitive version). Almost all forms of healing in the cosmere are filtered through the perception of the user. If a person hasn't accepted a wound as a part of themselves, they can still heal it regardless of how long they've had it. However, even if a wound is recent, if the person has changed their mindset to see it as a part of themselves, they will not be able to heal from it.

## Trivia
Blanking Identity and tapping Connection can cause someone to gain an accent for a particular area.
