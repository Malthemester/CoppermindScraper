**Tekiel Tower** is a large skyscraper built by [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is located in the financial district of the 4th Octant, on the bank of the 4th 5th Canal, across from the [[Ironspine Building\|Ironspine Building]]. Tekiel Tower is tall enough that even when uncompleted, its top was obscured by the [[Mist\|mists]] on the rare nights they appeared.
Its construction is in a sort-of race with the Ironspine Building to be the tallest building in Elendel. The architects would come up with revised blueprints of taller and taller buildings, attempting to outdo one another. Credible rumors said that both the Tekiel Tower and the Ironspine Building would top over fifty stories tall. During the raids by the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]], Tekiel tower is still uncompleted, and perhaps will remain so, due to the financial collapse of House Tekiel.
