>“*When Kaladin saw one of these point toward something, the skin stretching at the joint of his arm disintegrated and blew away, revealing the joint and knobs of the humerus. The skin quickly regrew.*”
\-A group of ashspren in Celebrant[3]


### Physical Realm
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], ashspren appear as cracks that appear to grow on surfaces or branch through the air. When they move they seem to burn through the inside of objects in treelike patterns.

### Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], ashspren take the form of humanoids with ashen-white skin. When the skin stretches, it's blown away, revealing white bones beneath before quickly growing back.


## Abilities
In the Physical Realm they can be unseen and unheard when they wish to be, making them excellent spies.

### Nahel bond
Ashspren are one of the few spren capable of forming [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] with people, turning them into [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] with the power over [[Division\|Division]] and [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]].

## Culture
Ashspren like to break things around them to see what's inside. Hundreds of them have died during the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], and unlike many others, it seems that ashspren never forgave humanity. They remain hostile towards them, blaming people's organized worship of [[Honor\|Honor]] for their kinsmen's many deaths. They seem uninterested in reforming the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], although it's uncertain how prevalent this outlook is. Some, like [[Spark\|Spark]], seem willing to bond with people or cooperate with [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces, while others dislike and avoid the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]].
Ashspren seem to sail Shadesmar a lot, although lately, they avoid [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] due to the Voidbringer presence there. They can be found in fairly large numbers in the spren city of [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]], though they speak their own, separate language. Like many other spren, they dislike [[Honorspren\|honorspren]], although unlike many others, they seem to have no problems with [[Cryptic\|Cryptics]].

## Notable Ashspren
