4 Notes


## Appearance and Personality
In M-Bot's projection, Spears appears as a clean-cut, young-looking man with tan skin, and wears a crisp uniform Spensa doesn't recognize.
Spears was likely acutely aware of the dangers associated with artificial intelligence, as M-Bot assumes Spears to be the one who severely limited his functions and capabilities.

## History
One hundred and seventy two years before M-Bot is found by [[Spensa\|Spensa]], Commander Spears traveled to Detritus in search of taynix slugs where, for some reason, he deactivated M-Bot. He disappeared into the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]] at some point after. He lived in the nowhere for hundreds of years, using his cytonic abilities to extend his life. He tried to escape through the lightburst, but he was unpracticed with his powers and the [[Delver\|delvers]] destroyed him. Afterward, the delver known as [[Chet\|Chet]] made a body based off of his form to disguise himself as a human.

## Relationships
### M-Bot
Due to his damaged memory banks, M-Bot remembers nothing of Spears or their history together, besides his name, appearance, and final command. As [[M-Bot\|M-Bot]] has no knowledge of the [[KRELL\|Krell]], it seems likely that neither did Spears, however, Spears was likely aware of the [[Superiority\|Superiority]].
