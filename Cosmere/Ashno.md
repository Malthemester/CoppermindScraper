**Ashno of Sages** is a rich [[Emuli\|Emuli]] holy man and former Prime on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Appearance and Personality
Given Ashno's status as one of the greatest leaders in Emul's history and his continued involvement in politics, it is likely he is wise and an excellent leader.
Little is known of Ashno's appearance, but he has a bad back and is somewhat of frail bearing in his old age.

## History
At some point in his life, Ashno became Prime of Emul. His reign was successful and afterwards he is considered to be one of the greatest Emuli Primes in history. At some point he left the throne and was replaced eventually by [[Vexil\|Vexil the Wise]]. Even after giving up the throne, Ashno still accompanied Vexil for at least some important political negotiations. It is uncertain at one point in time Ashno became a religious figure, but by his old age he had become well-known as a holy man.
In 1173, Ashno's palace was broken into by [[Shalash\|Shalash]], [[Baxil\|Baxil]], and [[Av\|Av]] so that Shalash could destroy the art in his Hallowed Hall, including an image of [[Epan\|Epan]], Lady of Dreams. In 1174, following the arrival of the Everstorm and the invasion of Emul by singers, he accompanied Vexil to [[Azimir\|Azimir]], so they could travel to Urithiru by way of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] and meet with the coalition. He attended at least one meeting of the coalition, in which it was decided that Aladar would help Emul defend what territory remained to it.
