The **Widow's Trial** is a mourning ceremony in [[Arelon\|Arelon]], created before the [[Reod\|Reod]].
A recent widow is expected to perform some type of charitable act. The effort and time the widow expends on her trial represents how much she valued her husband and their marriage. Typically widows give food or other necessities to the poor. [[Sarene\|Sarene]] utilizes the Widow's Trial to undermine [[Hrathen\|Hrathen's]] attempt to demonize the Elantrians by taking food to them, and encourages other nobles to accompany her. It originated from the religious surrounding the [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]], so it is considered a pagen ritual. However, Sarene's priest as well as many other followers [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] consider it a perfectly fine ritual as it only involved giving to those who need it rather than actually worshipping Elantrians.
