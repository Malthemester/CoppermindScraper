The **Theoryland Interview Database** is a collection of questions and their answers asked at various signings, releases, and other events. It aims to be a complete resource of all questions asked to [[Brandon\|Brandon]] on his works. It also contains interviews done by the *The Wheel of Time* community. The [[Brandonology\|Brandonology]] was merged into the database.



It has been mostly superseded by Arcanum, which has many more features.
