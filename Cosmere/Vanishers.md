The **Vanishers** are a criminal gang on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
They were employed by the [[Set\|Set]] to defraud [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]] and to kidnap potential [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]].
They were lead by [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]]. [[Tarson\|Tarson]] is second in command.
They attacked many trains, making the cargo disappear. They employed a number of novel technologies including a train equipped with a projection system. This was used to stop the oncoming train by appearing on a collision course. They then used a canal-based crane to steal the carriage and replace it with an empty replica.
