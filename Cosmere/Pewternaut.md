>“*Why do we need warships? The Basin is alone on land and on seas. From whom do we need protection?*”
\-Inis Julien, quoted in The New Ascendancy[1]


The **Pewternaut** is a class of [[Steel\|steel]]-hulled warships from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. They were developed by Lord Mayor [[Bastien Severington\|Bastien Severington]] of [[Bilming\|Bilming]] along with Dr. [[Florin Malin\|Florin Malin]] around 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]].
They are heavily-armored warships with reinforced hulls, electronic range-finders, and a total armament of sixteen 12-inch naval artillery guns, with a range of 16 miles. They are capable of reaching a top speed of 24 miles an hour. The Pewternaut represented a significant technological advancement compared to the  ships typically in use around the Basin.
Senator [[Inis Julien\|Inis Julien]] and other members of a delegation from [[Elendel\|Elendel]] that were invited to the unveiling of the ships publicly mocked them as unnecessary. This likely contributed to growing anti-Elendel sentiment in other cities, some of it incited by Lord Severington.
