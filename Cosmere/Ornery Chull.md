The **Ornery Chull** is a bar in the Kholin warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
It is a wooden structure constructed on the leeward side of a larger stone building. It uses fire for light due to concerns over intoxicated patrons stealing [[Sphere\|spheres]]. The main room tends to be crowded, smoky, and loud; the tavern also has private dining rooms off of a hallway in the back that are usually used by wealthy merchants. Popular drinks include wines and [[Lavis\|lavis]] ale; it does not serve [[Horneater\|Horneater]] lager, as it melts their cups.

## History

[[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] preferred other taverns that served Horneater lager.
One of the private rooms at the tavern was used by [[Graves\|Graves]] and other members of the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] to host their meeting with Moash and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] regarding [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]].
