The **Askarki** are a group of humans on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The [[Emuli\|Emuli]] are said to be a "tribe" of the Askarki, but the Emuli are also ethnically [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]]. This could suggest that the Askarki are not an ethnicity. The origin of the Askarki people are unknown. It is unclear if they are an ancient group who have carried through to modern day, a purely modern group, or an ancient group who have faded from existence. It is unclear what the Askarki people's relationship has been with [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] and its people historically.
