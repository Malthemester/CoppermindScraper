The **Collapse** was the night when the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] ended. After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] plan for it is sometimes known as the **Survivor's Gambit**.

## Causes
After [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] was killed by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], the [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]] used [[Kelsier's bones\|his bones]] to make the [[Skaa\|skaa]] think that Kelsier had returned from the dead. Inspired by his sacrifice and apparent power, the skaa begin to revolt and [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] guide them through taking control over key areas of the city.
The Lord Ruler allows the riots to progress, as he is confident in his ability to control them and they will keep the nobility from growing too confident. [[Vin\|Vin]], however, recognizes how much of a danger he poses and travels to [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]] to confront him. After being confused by the [[Eleventh Metal\|Eleventh Metal]] when she sees the Lord Ruler in his sanctum beneath the palace, she is captured by two [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]]. With the help of [[Sazed\|Sazed]], [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]], and [[Marsh\|Marsh]], she manages to escape and kill the Lord Ruler.

## Effects
With the Lord Ruler and Inquisitors dead and the armed forces in the city defeated by the skaa, the authority of the Final Empire was broken. The skaa rebels tried to kill everyone associated with the Final Empire, but Elend stopped them with a speech about his dreams of a new government, while also condemning bloodshed and chaos. [[Edgard Ladrian\|Breeze]] assisted in calming the city by Soothing the populace.
Elend leads the notable people of [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] in setting up the [[Luthadel Assembly\|new government]] and is crowned king of the Central Dominance. Without the Lord Ruler to hold the Final Empire together, nobles in the other [[Dominance\|Dominances]] begin to take control, notably [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] in the Western Dominance and [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]] in the Northern Dominance.
