**Fingermoss** is a type of plant native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] suspects that it may be related to [[Vinebud\|vinebuds]].
Fingermoss grows above ground on rock ridges and can be found at the edge of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. It grows in bunches and has bright pink and purple tendrils that wave in the wind. Fingermoss is more resistant to passersby than many other grasses, withdrawing only when the rocks around it are physically struck.
