## Appearance and Personality
He is clean-shaven with dark brown hair, and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] notes that he is a bit pale for an [[Alethi\|Alethi]]. However, he is later referred to as having leathery, dark skin.
He speaks with a slow [[Koron\|Koron]] drawl that originates from central Alethkar near the [[Sunmaker Mountains\|Sunmaker Mountains]].
He has a habit of rolling a [[Sphere\|sphere]] across his knuckles; he also formally salutes Dalinar constantly. He typically carries a flask of alcohol on his person.
[[Navani\|Navani]] considers him "greasy", but Dalinar likes him because he considers him similar to some of his friends from the "old days", referring to his time spent as a warlord.

## Attributes and Abilities
Rial was a member of Bridge Thirteen when they became [[Teft\|Teft's]] [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] [[Squire\|squires]]. Rial and the rest of the crew presumably gained limited [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities when they are within thirty miles of Teft, including healing powers and flight through the use of [[Basic Lashing\|Basic Lashings]].

## History
Rial's past is unknown, including the reason that he was part of a bridge crew.
Some time after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Rial and the rest of Bridge Thirteen were assigned to be bodyguards for the leadership in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after the members of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] became [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] [[Squire\|squires]]. He quickly became friendly with Dalinar and at one point spiked his canteen with alcohol. He guarded Dalinar on his first trip to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] and was present during Dalinar's duel with [[Kdralk\|Kdralk]]. He later offered Dalinar some alcohol just prior to him being branded a heretic by the [[Curates\|curates]] of the [[Holy Enclave\|Holy Enclave]].
Rial was aware that [[Navani\|Navani]] sent Dalinar a special timekeeping vambrace even before Dalinar opened the package.
Rial was not available to guard Dalinar during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] after [[Teft\|Teft]] became a [[Knights Radiant\|Knight Radiant]] and the members of Bridge Thirteen become his squires.

## Trivia
Rial's unusual accent and behavior, inconsistent appearance, mysterious past, and sudden proximity to Dalinar have led some readers to speculate that he is not a simple Alethi bridgeman and may be a [[Worldhopper\|Worldhopper]]. However, [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] has [[RAFO\|RAFO]]â€™d questions about him.
