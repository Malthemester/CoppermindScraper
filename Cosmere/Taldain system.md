The **Taldain system** is the planetary system that contains [[Taldain\|Taldain]], where [[White Sand\|White Sand]] takes place. It is a binary system consisting of one large star and a secondary smaller star. The smaller, a relatively dim white dwarf, is surrounded by a dense cloud of particles known as the Particulate Ring. The larger, a blue-white supergiant, plays an important role in the means by which Taldain is [[Invest\|Invested]] by [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]]. The positioning of the system was intentionally designed by someone, presumably Autonomy.
