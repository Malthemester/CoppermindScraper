## Appearance and Personality
Yixil appears as a tiny woman, glowing yellow-white like the center of a flame, and wears a flowing dress that covers her legs entirely.

When talking with [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], she manifests standing on a translucent pillar of gold stone so that she is at his eye level.

## Attributes and Abilties
Yixli has a similar level of control over who sees her as an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] would, though she doesn't appear to need a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] to maintain her mind while in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]].

## History
Yixli was one of the many yellow-white Voidspren that guided the newly-awakened [[Singer\|singers]] to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
