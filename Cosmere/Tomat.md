## Landmarks
### The Gap
Tomat has a city wall, but at the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] it had been broken for several generations, with the resulting gap becoming infamous among its citizens.

## History
Tomat was one of the cities that was occupied by [[Singer\|singers]] during the invasion of Alethkar by [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces that began in 1174. Although the city had a defensive wall, it had been broken by unknown means several generations before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. The residents of the city offered little resistance to the invading army.
In 1175, the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] sent scouts on reconnaissance missions throughout Alethkar. [[Kara\|Kara]] observed the area that included Tomat, taking notes on singer troop placement and the condition of the buildings. She reported that the city was in good shape, likely owing to the fact that they had quickly surrendered. She also noted that the singers had started to repair the city wall.

## Notable Residents
[[Hesina\|Hesina]] had particular interest in reading Kara's notes on Tomat. She had a conversation with [[Lirin\|Lirin]] indicating that her father lived in the city and owned a business there. Hesina worried that her father's obstinate personality might have led him to resist the singers even if the rest of the town surrendered.
