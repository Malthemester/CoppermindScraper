**HaiKo** is a city in [[JinDo\|JinDo]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. It is located in the northeast corner of JinDo, situated on a river and at the foot of a mountain range. It is on the eastern border with [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] and near the northern border with [[Duladel\|Duladel]]. It is the only city marked on known maps of JinDo.
The city has a namesake dish cooked using lots of grease, as is common for JinDo food. [[Kiin\|Kiin]] learned how to make the dish from a traveling merchant. Kiin's version contains shrimp, and [[Lukel\|Lukel]] and [[Sarene\|Sarene]] find it delicious.

## Trivia
In early editions of *Elantris*, a map of Arelon was published depicting HaiKo in the south of JinDo. However, new maps were added in the tenth anniversary edition that superseded the original maps.
