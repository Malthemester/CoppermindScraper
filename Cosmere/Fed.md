**Fed** is a Skimmer and a member of the [[Set\|Set]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
At some point in her life, Fed became a low level member of the Set, possibly as a part of the [[Hidden Guard\|Hidden Guard]]. She accompanied the group of the Set that was lead by [[Edwarn\|Edwarn]] and [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]] to the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]] in the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]]. When Edwarn fled the Temple in the [[Southern Scadrian\|Hunter]] airship after [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] was given the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]], Fed used her Feruchemy to prime the weight-changing machinery so the ship could take off. She was presumably captured along with the other members of the Set onboard when Wax defeated Edwarn and used his [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] to stop the ship from escaping.
