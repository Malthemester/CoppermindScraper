**Fu Abra** is a [[Purelaker\|Purelaker]] village on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is located somewhere on the Purelake and is the only village miles. A rare fish, known as a [[Kolgril\|kolgril]], can be found near the village.
The buildings are built on stilts, however, they are only partially raised, with several inches of water being found covering inside flooring. They have domed roofs, which make them resemble [[Rockbud\|rockbuds]].
[[Maib\|Maib's]] house is located near the center of the village. It is where [[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] met, more than once, with [[Galladon\|Grump]], [[Baon\|Blunt]], and [[Demoux\|Thinker]] in their search for [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. Ishikk claims that Hoid hasn't been around.
