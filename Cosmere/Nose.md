As part of their training, [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] were paired with Nightmare Flight for a routine debris tagging mission. During the exercise, Nose paired Sushi and Nord with [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]], and Bog and Tunestone with [[Spensa\|Spensa]] and [[FM\|FM]], instructing them to demonstrate ship maneuvers for the cadets. After witnessing Spensa and FM's [[Light-lance\|light-lancing]] skills, Nose offered them both positions in Nightmare Flight. When Jorgen, FM, and Spensa attracted the attention of the [[Varvax\|Krell]], Nose tried to pair the cadets with members of Nightmare Flight. However, Jorgen intervened, asking for Skyward Flight to remain together. Nose granted the request then instructed the pilots to watch for [[Lifebuster\|Lifebusters]] and remain evasive until [[Riptide Flight\|Riptide Flight]] could arrive to reinforce them.
Later, Nightmare Flight participated in the [[Second Battle of Alta\|Second Battle of Alta]].
