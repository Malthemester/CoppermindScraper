>“*It was a good religion, Master Kelsier. It focused on discovery and knowledge—to these people, the making of maps was a reverent duty. They believed that once all of the world was known, understood, and catalogued, men would ﬁnally ﬁnd peace and harmony.*”
\-Sazed's description of the Truths of the Bennet to Kelsier[1]


The **Truths of the Bennet** was the religion of the Bennet people, who lived on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Classical Scadrial\|classical era]]. It is one of the religions recorded in [[Sazed\|Sazed's]] copperminds
The Bennet were a highly developed people that lived on islands in the south, possibly among the ones with volcanoes that [[Braches\|Braches]] told [[Alendi\|Alendi]] about. They were accomplished seafarers and cartographers; some of their maps, presumably ones created after the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]] but before their culture was suppressed, were still being used by the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] at the time of the [[Collapse\|Collapse]].
The Truths of the Bennet considered mapmaking to be a sacred duty and taught that humans would find peace once the entire world was charted and understood. It was designed to be practiced while at sea; a ship's captain also served as its minister and theological training was a prerequisite for commanding a ship. [[Sazed\|Sazed]] believes that few other people from the classical era adhered to ideals of peace and discovery in their religion as well as the Bennet did.
While they are planning to overthrow the Final Empire, Sazed suggests the Truths of the Bennet to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] as a possible religion. Kelsier rejects it, saying he's not interested in "peace and harmony" right now, and asks about the [[Valla\|Valla]] instead. During [[Final Ascension\|his Ascension]], Sazed uses their maps of the world from before the Lord Ruler's Ascension, which were recorded in his metalminds, to undo the changes [[Rashek\|Rashek]] made to the landscape while he held the power of the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]].
