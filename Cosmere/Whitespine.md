## Appearance and Anatomy

The eponymous spine is a row of spikes that runs from the head along the back of a whitespine. They are as large as horses, with a carapaced back, powerful legs, and a reptilian appearance. They have long white tusks that are used for impalement which can break off and remain lodged in their prey, causing severe damage. Whitespines have claws, including a set of vestigial claws behind their primary legs, and they smell quite unpleasant, especially when wet. They also have a nose of some sort that allows them to sniff and sneeze. They are able to enter a dormant state, most likely to hibernate, during which they appear to become coated in a thick, hard crystal-like substance that takes time to accumulate. Water washes away the crystal coating in its early stages of forming, which would make it difficult for a whitespine to undergo this metamorphosis during a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]].

## Ecology
Whitespines live in packs in dens that are often strewn with the bones of the creatures they have killed. Sometimes they will live near roadways to pick off travelers as prey. They hide near the carcass of their recent kill after consuming its meat, then hunt the scavengers that are attracted to the carcass. Whitespines are native to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and possibly other areas. They are "nastier" than [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]].

## History
 by  Ben McSweeney 
Whitespines are often hunted by [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] and their [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] attendants, especially if the whitespines have been killing humans.
Brightlord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] and his son [[Rillir\|Rillir]], along with [[Alds\|Alds]] and [[Milp\|Milp]] go hunting for a whitespine that has been attacking travelers. They are attacked by the whitespine; Rillir is killed, and likely Alds and Milp as well. Roshone survives the attack, but loses his leg.

## Cultural References
