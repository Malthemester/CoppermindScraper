**Tuaka'li'na'calmi'nor**, shortened to **Tuaka** or simply **Song**, is [[Lunamor\|Lunamor's]] wife. She has a round face and wears her deep red hair in a braid.

## History
Tuaka and Lunamor have known each other since childhood, when they built snow forts in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]]; according to Rock, hers were always the best. At some point before Lunamor left to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] they married and had six children. After Lunamor's eldest brother, [[Kef'ha\|Kef'ha]], died in combat against [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], Rock sent a terse letter to his wife explaining their failure. He sent additional letters after gaining his freedom in Tanat 1173, requesting that Tuaka move the family to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
Tuaka arrived at the Shattered Plains with her family in Jes 1174 after traveling for months to meet with Lunamor. While in Alethkar she wore a glove on her [[Safehand\|safehand]] to respect Vorin custom. Tuaka's caravan was attacked by [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] and her family defended themselves behind a pile of furniture. During the attack a member of her family--likely Tuaka herself--shot a Voidbringer with an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrow. They were found by [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] during a patrol and taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] insisted that they take his rooms until he could get family quarters for the members of Bridge Four.
When Tuaka was reunited with Lunamor she was worried about not having heard from him in such a long time, and knew little of what happened since Rock became Sadeas's servant. She was surprised to learn that he is now a chef, with all of his brothers dead, but Lunamor insisted that she not press the subject. She also brought news of troubles at the Horneater Peaks, which she only felt comfortable discussing in private.
