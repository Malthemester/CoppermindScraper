**House Izenry** is a noble house in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
They are publicly known as the rival house to [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]]. House Izenry is strong enough that an assassination of a Tekiel ally could reasonably be attributed to House Izenry.
In the prelude to the house war prior to the [[Collapse\|Collapse]] of the Final Empire, [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] killed [[Charrs Entrone\|Charrs Entrone]] and left his corpse at Keep Tekiel to sow division amongst the nobility. Kelsier believed that House Izenry would initially be blamed for the murder, however, further investigations into Entrone's death would increase confusion, potentially making someone think another actor wanted to strengthen the Izenry-Tekiel rivalry.
