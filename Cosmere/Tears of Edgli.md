The **Tears of Edgli** are a plant found in the valley jungle of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. They produce dyes that hold fast in any cloth. Other dyes do not work nearly as well, making the plants highly desirable. They come in different colors and are very efficient for [[Awakening\|Awakening]].

## Relation to Endowment
The Tears of Edgli are named after [[Edgli\|Edgli]], the [[Vessel\|Vessel]] of [[Endowment\|Endowment]]. They only grow in Hallandren because, much like the [[Atium\|atium]] geodes in the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], they are dependent on the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] seeping into the ground from Endowment's [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]], which is nearby. Their ability to power Awakening much more efficiently likely results from this Investiture and connection to Endowment.

## The Manywar
One of the causes of the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] were the economic value of Tears of Edgli.

## Economics
The Tears are the reason for the wealth of the people in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. Despite Hallandren's remote location, the dyes were a rare and attractive commodity to individuals throughout [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], making [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] a prime port and was a strong foundation for trade between Hallandren and other kingdoms.
