**Rod** is a member of [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] in the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] army on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is one of Lopen's many [[Herdazian\|Herdazian]] cousins. He is beefy, with thick arms. He does not speak much [[Alethi\|Alethi]], but still comes across as jovial.

## History
Rod and another cousin, [[Huio\|Huio]], joined the Bridge Four crew after its relocation to the [[Shattered Plains\|Kholin warcamp]]. It is unclear if Rod had been serving in another [[Highprince\|Highprince's]] army before joining Bridge Four. He was presumably among the cousins that had some difficulty carrying a bridge on their first training run.
He was killed by the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]].
Although [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] barely knew Rod, he felt a responsibility to protect him. Rod was one of the many people that Kaladin remembered while he was attempting to say the [[Immortal Words\|Fourth Ideal]] of the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]].
A significant portion of Lopen, Huio, and [[Punio\|Punio's]] stipends as Radiants go to Rod's family, in accordance with Herdazian cultural norms of caring for poorer cousins.
