>“*Even if it had destroyed many a ship, Puuli was happy for this new storm. Secretly happy.*”
\-Puuli, thinking about the Everstorm[1]


**Puuli** is a lighthouse keeper in a small port village in eastern [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Puuli is a [[Natan\|Natan]] man, squat and short, with blue skin and white hair. His family has lived in his small town for multiple generations. He favors hard work and tradition, and seems rather unimpressed with the way that "rich people" choose to spend their money. He is friendly with almost everyone in town, although he sometimes masks his true feelings from them. He primarily worships [[Kelek\|Kelek]], and leaves him offerings of fruit. He believes that Kelek lives in the [[Highstorm\|Highstorm]], and uses his name interchangeably with that of the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]].

## History
>“*They’ll come with Light in their pockets. They’ll come to destroy, but you should watch for them anyway. Because they’ll come from the Origin. The sailors lost on an infinite sea.*”
\-Puuli's grandfather[1]

After the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] reached his small coastal community, Puuli commiserated about the death and destruction that it caused with the other townfolk, including [[Sakin\|Sakin]], [[Au-lam\|Au-lam]], [[Hema-Dak\|Hema-Dak]], and the [[Drummer brothers\|Drummer brothers]]. He pitched in and helped those in need during the recovery from the storm, performing various tasks from cleanup to watching over children. At the same time, he collected scrap wood whenever it was available, putting it into his cart to take it to his lighthouse, which he called [[Defiance\|Defiance]]. He dried the wood out and used it as firewood.
Although he was sad about some of the Everstorm's effects, Puuli was secretly happy about its arrival. He was not worried about his lighthouse, and was very matter-of-fact about the damage that had occurred in and around the town. His grandfather had told him legends of lost sailors who lived on a hidden island near the [[Origin\|Origin]]. These sailors were foretold to return to the Rosharan continent when the night was darkest to reclaim the ancient lands of [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. Puuli believed that the Everstorm must signify a coming time of changes.
