The **Thaylen Gemstone Reserve** is the national bank of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] located in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] just outside the Ancient Ward by the wall. The Reserve acts as a protector of wealth so that gemstones do not need to be moved from one location to the next thus exposing them to the risk of theft. Many of the gems never leave the vault and are left uncharged.

## Management
While the whole structure of the Gemstone Reserve is unknown, [[Rysn\|Rysn]] is working there taking care of Queen [[Fen\|Fen's]] personal finances, and that position comes with an office in the Gemstone reserve. Part of her duties involve keeping the Queen's personal vault.

Each of these gems have individual ID numbers placed under them for identification purposes. Inside of this vault is [[Fen\|Queen Fen's]] personal vault.
Notable gemstones include the [[King's Drop\|King's Drop]], a large ruby that has stayed infused with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] for centuries, as well as the [[Benval Diamond\|Benval Diamond]], once owned by [[Vstim\|Vstim]].
