The **cambric** are a member species of the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] and one of five species currently at the head of the government. They do not have a large presence on [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]].
Given the similarities in their names, they may come from the planet [[Cambri\|Cambri]], the homeworld of the [[Taynix\|taynix]]. If so, that might explain how they developed faster-than-light travel and rose to the top of the Superiority.
