**Traiben** is a [[Lossand\|Lossandin]] [[Sand mastery\|sand master]] on the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]].

## Appearance and Personality
Traiben is a friendly man who is bald and has light Daysider skin. He wears the traditional robes of a sand master.

## History
He entered the [[Diem\|Diem]] at the same time as [[Kenton\|Kenton]] and remains Kenton's best friend even though he is promoted to the rank of mastrell while Kenton remained an acolent. Traiben generally supports Kenton, although he is skeptical of Kenton's decision to undergo the [[Mastrell's Path\|Mastrell's Path]].
After Kenton succeeds in his run and completes the Path, retrieving an unheard of six spheres, Traiben remarks that when he ran the Path he only found three spheres. When [[Elorin\|Elorin]] tries convincing Kenton not to go to the advancement ceremony, Traiben encourages Kenton to attend the Advancement ceremony saying that his father will have to make him a mastrell. Before the advancement ceremony Traiben, along with the rest of the Diem, drinks from the ceremonial bowl that Elorin had poisoned with [[KaDo\|KaDo]]. During the ceremony, a large band of [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] warrior-priests launch a surprise attack. Due to the KaDo, Traiben is killed while defending himself from the Kerztians, overmastering within minutes, when he should be able to use his powers for much longer.
