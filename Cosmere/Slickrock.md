**Slickrock** is a type of rock on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Characteristics
It is exceptionally smooth, flat, and even, with only a few [[Rockbud\|rockbuds]] typically able to grow on its surface. Large fields of nearly unbroken slickrock can be found in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and possibly in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]].

## History
Because slickrock fields provide a large amount of open space with an easily traversable surface, they have served as the setting of several large battles. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] and [[Nalanar\|Nalanar]] once fought a tightly contested strategic battle referred to as "[[Battle of Slickrock\|Slickrock]]", likely near the Veden-Alethi border. In [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] final battle with [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army, the battlefield was described as a large, flat expanse of slickrock.
