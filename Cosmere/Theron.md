**Theron** is a skaa thief from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
Theron is a tall man who wears a simple grey shirt and slacks. He keeps a thins sword tied around his waist.
Like most thieves, Theron doesn't trust anyone. He likely would have betrayed [[Camon\|Camon]] if given the chance, but Camon betrays him he had a chance.
[[Vin\|Vin]] nearly had to use her Luck on Theron to get him to stop running his eyes up and down her body.

## History
About six years before the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], Theron discovered that the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]] secretly moved a large amount of funds to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] along with acolytes transferring to Luthadel for their final instruction. Over the next five years, he spent thousands of [[Boxing\|boxings]] to create the perfect opportunity to steal these funds, creating the appearance that House Jedue was financially desperate. This included faking contracts for House Jedue to "loose," such as the **Farwan** deal, the "loss" of which made it appear as if House Jedue could no long afford to run its canal boats to Luthadel. This appearance, in turn, allowed him to apply for a contract with the [[Canton of Finance\|Canton of Finance]] to run the canal boats that transported the acolytes, and make the offer extremely appealing by offering a significantly reduced price without it appearing suspicious.
To sell the con, however, Theron needed someone to play the role of Lord Jedue, and so reluctantly partnered with [[Camon\|Camon]], one of the best [[Noble\|noble]] impersonators in the Luthadel underground. Camon played along, but he knew Theron's resources were stretched thin. After securing the contract, Camon betrayed Theron and simply took the three thousand boxing down payment, abandoning the plan to actual run the boats and steel from the convoy, and leaving Theron to deal with the Ministry's wrath when it discovered it had been scammed.
When [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] needed a way to get [[Marsh\|Marsh]] into the Steel Ministry, [[Vin\|Vin]] remembered that Theron had an obligator contact that was open to bribes on the canal route that new acolytes took to Luthadel. [[Dockson\|Dockson]] then reached out to Theron and was able to use his contact to get Marsh added as an acolyte from the contact's local chapter.
The [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitors]] hunting Vin discovered the connection between her and Theron's crew, and massacred the entire crew.
If Theron and Camon had successfully pulled off the attack on the convoy, they would have found [[Atium\|atium]] hidden among the coins, revealing to [[Ruin\|Ruin]] that most atium never left the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]].
