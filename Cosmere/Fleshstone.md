>“*The second become Fleshstones, which are what really make us into Crystin.*”
\-Bastille's explanation of Crystallia[1]


The **Fleshstone** is a crystal embedded in the back of the neck of a knight of [[Crystallia\|Crystallia]].
Fleshstones are created from one of the three types of crystals that grow in Crystallia. They appear as blue crystals in the back of a Crystin's neck. When removed from a Crystin, they are about the size of two fingers. The act of removing a Fleshstone from a Crystin is considered a deep violation and can lead to the Crystin's death if it is not replaced.
The Fleshstone improves the physical abilities of a Crystin beyond normal human abilities. In particular, it gives them an enhanced speed and strength. It accomplishes this by connecting all the Crystin together through the [[Mindstone\|Mindstone]]. When one Crystin knows how to do something, every Crystin gets slightly better at it. Crystin can also feel the presence of other Crystin through the Fleshstone. Sensing a Fleshstone is not dependent on the Fleshstone being inside a Crystin. This also creates a weakness in the Knights, that is if the Mindstone is interrupted, an enemy can harm all the Knights through the connection.
Alcatraz sends his [[Smedry Talent\|Talent]] through the Fleshstone into every Crystin at the end of the [[Siege of Mokia\|Siege of Mokia]].
