\-Mink to Alcatraz[1]


**Mink** is one of [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz Smedry's]] [[Mokia\|Mokian]] advisors during the battle for [[Tuki Tuki\|Tuki Tuki]]. She advises Alcatraz along with the other two advisors, [[Dink\|Dink]] and [[Wink\|Wink]], with whom she is not related.

## Appearance and Personality
Mink is short and compact, with her arms pulled in at her side and her chin nestled down level with her shoulders. Alcatraz likens her appearance to a can of soda.

## History
During the battle, she gives Alcatraz information on the Mokian defenses such as the dome, and how long they’ll hold. At Alcatraz’ orders, Mink and the other counselors went to fetch him some backpacks full of explosive teddy bears, six of their fastest warriors, and a pair of very long stilts. They hesitated briefly, but did as asked.
