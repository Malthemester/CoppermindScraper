>“* It passed directly underneath. Sak chirped quietly from Dusk’s shoulder; the second bird seemed to have some sense of the danger. Creatures like the shadow did not hunt by smell or sight, but by sensing the minds of prey.*”

A **deepwalker**, also called **shadow**, is a large sea-dwelling predatory creature on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]], only living in the waters near the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]]..
Like many creatures native to the Pantheon, it hunts by sensing minds of other living creatures, making protection bestowed by mind-shielding [[Aviar\|Aviar]] essential for unarmed boats. They hunt in the open sea, but are also capable of exploding out of the water to devour prey on the beach. They only seek larger prey, not bothering themselves with smaller food like [[Slimfish\|slimfish]]..
A deepwalker is as wide as six narrowboats tied together, and possesses something like claws or tusks that are sharp enough to gouge rocks.
The [[Ironhull\|ironhull]] class of ship can successfully attack and defend themselves from deepwalker threats; they manage to kill one during the expedition to [[Patji (island)\|Patji]] by the [[Northern Interests Trading Company\|Northern Interests Trading Company]]..
