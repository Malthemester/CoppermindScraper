**Exel** is a member of the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] cell based in [[Babilar\|Babilar]]. Exel gathers information from the inhabitants of [[Babilar\|Babilar]], and is recognized by people in the city. Much of this skill in this can be assumed to come from his experience as a pre-Calamity government agent. As a former mortician, Exel visits funerals and often makes morbid (but well-natured) jokes about how someone would look as a corpse. He is described as an extremely large man by [[David\|David]].
After [[Prof\|Prof's]] prevention of Babilar's destruction and subsequent corruption from overuse of his [[Epic\|Epic]] abilities, Exel was brutally crushed to death, along with [[Valentine\|Val]], by their former leader's forcefield abilities.
