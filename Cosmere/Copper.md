**Copper** is the internal mental pulling metal. An Allomancer burning copper is able to hide Allomantic pulses emanating from those around them, and is immune to emotional Allomancy. Feruchemists can use copper to store memories, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, copper can steal mental fortitude, memory, or intelligence.
It can be alloyed with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] to form [[Duralumin\|duralumin]].

## Allomantic Use
A copper [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Coppercloud** or **Smoker**. When an Allomancer is burning copper, the pulses from nearby Allomancers cannot be detected by most Seekers. Allomancers with a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] spike that enhances their natural ability with bronze, genetically more powerful Allomancers, such as those created with [[Lerasium\|lerasium]], and bronze [[Savant\|savants]] are all capable of "piercing" a coppercloud. Nicrosil can also allow a Mistborn or a Seeker to pierce a coppercloud for a brief moment; duralumin would also work for a Mistborn. Multiple Smokers burning copper in the same area will make the resulting coppercloud harder to pierce. As few Allomancers have the ability to pierce a coppercloud, Smokers are of central importance when Allomancers are trying to hide. If a Seeker is inside of a coppercloud, they will be unable to receive any pulses from the outside. Copper is the slowest burning metal of the basic eight Allomantic metals.
Copperclouds can also block other uses of Investiture. On Scadrial, this is most commonly seen in its ability to protect the user from emotional Allomancy; protecting others in the cloud's boundaries is very difficult but not impossible. Copperclouds also block other methods of detecting Investiture, such as an [[Awakener\|Awakener's]] [[Heightening\|lifesense]] or a secretspren's ability to sense the use of Investiture. Additionally, a coppercloud can interfere with more passive uses of Investiture; for example, it can prevent a [[Singer\|singer]] from attuning a Rhythm and affects how spren act.

### Savantism
Savanthood is less debilitating for Smokers compared to other metals.

## Feruchemical Use
A copper [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as an **Archivist**. Copper is used to store memories. This ability forms the core of the [[Keeper\|Keepers]], a group of Terrismen dedicated to preserving knowledge. Since the memories in a coppermind do not degrade with time (although they are vulnerable to [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] manipulation while being transferred), it is perfect for the collection of enormous quantities of facts. For this reason, Feruchemists were much more likely to be scholars than warriors. When an Archivist stores a memory in a coppermind, it immediately disappears from their memory. Memories stored in a coppermind are filed individually and are not seen as one whole memory to the Archivist. The best users of copperminds would create indexes to find memories much faster. Finally, the longer a memory sits outside of a coppermind, the more it degrades, though this is due to the brain's own imperfections, not any quirk of the magic. Keepers undergo extensive training in memory retention to make the most of this ability. Copperminds can not store muscle memory.

### Compounding
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

Copper is unique among Feruchemical metals in that the individual bits of Feruchemical charge (the memories) are distinct from one another, as opposed to a metal like [[Steel\|steel]] in which no bit of stored speed is discernible from another. Thus the possible effect of compounding copper is unclear. [[Rashek\|Rashek]] was said to have had a flawless memory, possibly the effect of copper compounding, though this ability could have just been propaganda or a non-magical talent like that of his uncle [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]].

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, copper steals mental fortitude, memory, and intelligence.

### Kandra Blessing
The [[Kandra\|kandra]] can use a pair of these spikes as a [[Blessing\|Blessing]] and call them the **Blessing of Presence**. Like all kandra Blessings, the Blessing gives the [[Mistwraith\|mistwraiths]] sentience, with the added benefit of mental stability. The Blessing of Presence helps a kandra resist Ruin's influence.

## Fabrial Use
Copper can probably be used in [[Rosharan\|Rosharan]] [[Fabrial\|fabrials]]. Its effect is unclear, although it might be able to negate alerter fabrials, which are made using bronze. It has not yet been discovered by Rosharan artifabrians.
[[Reacher\|Reachers]] use copper lines in their ships to communicate between one another.
