## History
### On Mirandus
Malmahan rose as Dark One in Mirandus. No  appeared to challenge his power and he nearly destroyed the [[Kingdoms of Light\|Kingdoms of Light]] and Mirandus. Illarion, the Destined One from the previous cycle, went to fight Malmahan because Illarion refused to wait for a Destined One to match Malmahan. Illarion ended up victorious, but in reality, Illarion somehow sent Malmahan to .

### On Earth
Malmahan assumed the name of Mr. Caligo in his time on Earth. He killed one individual each year to charge the [[Peragator\|Peragator]], a device which would allow him to return to Mirandus. He killed twenty-eight individuals in total. The police knew of fifteen of these murders, and eventually arrested Malmahan. He hired the law firm of  for his criminal defense. One lawyer at the firm, [[Lin Yang-Tanasin\|Lin Yang-Tanasin]], visited Malmahan in jail, who was kept in solitary confinement. The guards warned Lin that Malmahan was a dangerous criminal and that she could only communicate with him nonverbally, which she rejected. She was still refused sharp objects and instructed her to sit throughout the visit. The guards brought Malmahan out, wearing a muzzle. Malmahan explained to Lin that a man said something extremely racist, so Malmahan bit his tongue out. Malmahan wished to plead guilty for his murders, and wanted to help the police find his other victims which they had never found. Malmahan wanted the state to execute him as quickly as possible.
At his trial, the court denied his request for the death penalty. Malmahan then used his abilities as Dark One and used the hatred all of the members of the court to possess them. Only Lin remained unpossessed. Malmahan grabbed a gun and forced Lin to shoot him dead. He explained that the Peragator required one last death: his own. However, he couldn't kill himself to activate it. He threatened to murder every single person Lin ever loved, and she shot him. This transitioned both Malmahan and Lin into Mirandus. It also caused [[Paul Tanasin\|Paul Tanasin]], the current Dark One, to travel back from Mirandus to the courthouse where Malmahan's trial took place.
