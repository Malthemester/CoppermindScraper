Lord **Westweather Cett** is the heir to the Cett fortune in [[Elendel\|Elendel]], circa 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]].
[[Wax\|Wax]] headbutts him at a party and breaks his nose, after Cett demands to duel him.
Wax later refers to him "that smarmy little man with the ridiculous mustache", though this may not be a fully accurate description of his appearance.
