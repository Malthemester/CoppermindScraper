**Dawncity** is a term used to describe a city on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that is old enough to be able to trace the origin of said city all the way back to the [[Dawnsingers\|Dawnsingers]].
As of 1173, discussing the Dawncities had recently become fashionable among the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]. No city has yet been confirmed to be a Dawncity. One man, [[Au-nak\|Au-nak]] seemed to believe that the city of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]] was a Dawncity, due to the complex stone patterns that the city was built within. Highprince [[Hatham\|Hatham's]] wife studied the Dawncities.
The Dawncities may have been created with the use of [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], but in [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] visions, he had seen no sign of any of the Dawncities.
They are beyond the scope of what a group of Radiants could create via [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]]. They may have been created by the Dawnsingers making use of an early form of [[Stoneshaping\|Stoneshaping]] to shape cities in the stone.
