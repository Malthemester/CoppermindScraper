>“*Don't hedge bets with your life, Kaladin. Don't put in a chip when you have a pocket full of marks. Bet them all or leave the table.*”
\-Durk's advice to Kaladin[1]


**Durk** is a [[Rosharan\|Rosharan]]--probably serving in Brightlord [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army--and likely one of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] mentor figures or friends prior to his arrival on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].

## Appearance and Personality
Nothing is known of Durk's appearance. He is a fairly superstitious man, and wears a pair of 'lucky boots' into every battle. Durk believes that one should not hedge when living ones life; he should either commit to something fully or not at all.

## History
It is unknown when Durk and Kaladin met. At some point before Kaladin was enslaved, Durk told Kaladin that he was a natural born soldier and an artist with the spear. He also gave Kaladin advice, telling him not to live his life hedging bets. Kaladin often recalls Durk and his advice later on in his life.
