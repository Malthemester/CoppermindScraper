## Physical Changes to the Planet
While Rashek held the power of the Well, he moved the [[Scadrial\|planet]] closer to its star in an attempt to defeat the [[Deepness\|Deepness]]. However, this made the planet too hot for the inhabitants of Scadrial to survive, so he created the Ashmounts to shoot ash and smoke into the atmosphere to make it thicker.
As a result, he then also had to change the plant life to be able to survive on less sunlight, and in turn had to alter the people to be able to survive on the less nutritious plants, as well as allow them to be able to survive constantly breathing in ash.
He moved the Well of Ascension by flattening the Terris of his day. He also created mountains in the area that would become the north, the Terris of the Final Empire. He knew the Well would fill up again and wanted to be prepared to once again take up the power held there, as well as prevent any who would seek the Well from finding it.

## Metallic Arts
With the power of the Well, he came to understand the three [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]], Allomancy, Feruchemy and Hemalurgy.

### Allomancy
Rashek was given knowledge of [[Lerasium\|Lerasium]], nuggets of metal in the Chamber of Ascension. Ingesting these metals would turn the person into a Mistborn, something that had not existed to this point in time.

### Hemalurgy
While Rashek still held the power of the Well, he created three Hemalurgic Constructs: [[Koloss\|koloss]], [[Kandra\|kandra]] and [[Steel Inquisitor\|Steel Inquisitors]].


During the time he held the power of the Well, he changed all other living [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] into [[Mistwraith\|Mistwraiths]] and his close friends into the first generation of [[Kandra\|Kandra]]. He did this because he saw and understood that someone with the full power of [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and Feruchemy (like him) would challenge his supremacy.
