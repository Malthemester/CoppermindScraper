## Appearance and Personality
Alalan is a short [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] man with curly hair. He is quiet but holds an almost imperceptible air of determination and authority. He is protective of his son and courageous enough to openly support the Radiants.

## History
Alalan came to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with his wife and his son [[Adin\|Adin]]. He worked as a journeyman at Master [[Liganor\|Liganor's]] pottery shop in the marketplace, and was trained as a potter prior to his employment there. He worked alongside [[Gub\|Gub]], the other journeyman, and also taught Adin the basics of pottery. When Adin hurt his ankle, Alalan took him to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to have it looked at.
During [[Raboniel\|Raboniel's]] occupation of Urithiru, Alalan continued working as normal and deferred to passing [[Singers\|singers]], advising Adin not to glare at them. He also helped care for the fallen [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] and left his home every night in secret for unknown reasons. When things in the atrium began brewing prior to Kaladin's final fight with [[Lezian\|Lezian]], Master Liganor entered the pottery shop to tell Alalan about it and looked to the calm man for approval before closing the shop. Before Liganor left, he instructed Alalan to keep making water pots, as their supply was low; however, Alalan abandoned his half-finished pot on the wheel as soon as the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] was gone. A few unusual comments and actions from Alalan led Adin to deduce that he had been wearing the *shash* [[Glyph\|glyph]] on his forehead in support of the Knights Radiant, and that his nightly outings were presumably related to watching over the fallen [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]]. Alalan grudgingly allowed his son to accompany him to check on the situation in the Radiant infirmary and the atrium.
Alalan took up arms against Lezian's soldiers to protect the wounded rebels in the atrium. He was seriously injured, but survived the fight.

>“*Men who make sloppy plates will be sloppy fighting Fused.*”
\-Alalan to Adin[1]


[[Adin\|Adin]] is Alalan's son. Alalan teaches him pottery and knows about his "secret" desire to become a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]]. He frequently has some piece of fatherly advice for Adin and directs him to act submissive around the [[Singers\|singers]] and [[Fused\|Fused]]. Through observing his father, Adin realizes that bravery can take many forms, and that Alalan only acts like nothing is out of the ordinary so he can bide his time and hide his plans for rebellion. He respects Alalan and thinks of him as a hero.
