## Appearance and Personality
 by  mushimallo 
For more images, see [[Allik Neverfar/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Allik is twenty two, and has a short wispy beard and moustache, which make him look younger. Like all [[Malwish\|Malwish]], he wears a red and black mask over his face at all times.
Allik seems to be a bit of a free spirit, and is not afraid to say whatever happens to come to his mind. He is the most comfortable of the Brunstell’s crew in interacting with the Northern Scadrians, and doesn’t seem as put off by their maskless state as the Southerners.
Allik subscribes to the customs of his people in his dealings with Allomancers, although the titles he uses for Wax, such as "O Great Impetuous One" and "Unobservant Master" are not always the most respectful.

## Attributes and Abilities

>“*You have to be something more special than that, if you want to fly. We're expected to be gentlemen and ladies. We’ve thrown people overboard for not knowing the proper dance moves.*”
\-Allik to Marasi[5]


Allik does not possess any [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] or [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] abilities, but he is able to use the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] through the [[Unsealed metalminds\|medallions]] his people produce. He displays an extensive knowledge of some Metallic Arts, as he is able to tell with just a glance what Wax’s abilities are. However, he seems to be less familiar with temporal Allomancy, as he does not initially realize that [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] are Allomancers.
Allik's dancing is not good enough to impress his captain.

## History
 by  zoethatcher art  Trapped in the cage
Allik grew up on the south pole of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], as part of the Malwish nation in a town named [[Wiestlow\|Wiestlow]]. He flew north on the airship Brunstell under Captain [[Jordis\|Jordis]] as a pilot for the shuttle [[Wilg\|Wilg]]. After the Brunstell was downed in the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]], Allik was captured by the Set along with the rest of the crew. When [[Wax\|Wax's]] team infiltrated the Set’s base outside of [[New Seran\|New Seran]], [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] freed Allik from his imprisonment. Allik then helped them escape the Set and led them to the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign's]] Temple to seek the legendary [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]]. He was able to free the rest of his crew from the Set and returned with them to his homeland.

## Relationships
### Marasi
Allik gives Marasi his mask before the Brunstell departs [[Elendel\|Elendel]], leading Wayne to remark that Allik might have a crush on Marasi.

### Wax
Due to the fact that he was raised to revere [[Metalborn\|Metalborn]] Allik treats Wax with reverence. Wax finds this annoying and often tells Allik to stop.
