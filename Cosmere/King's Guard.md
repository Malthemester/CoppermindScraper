## Pre-Tower
Prior to the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], the King's Guard was composed of [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] loyal to the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] family. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] administered the guard and was directly in charge of securing the king's safety. He ensured that the members of the King's Guard were very loyal to him.

## Post-Tower
After the betrayal by [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], Dalinar's officers were decimated. The two hundred and fifty soldiers left in the guard were needed in his army as officers, so as [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] proved themselves both loyal and capable, they were merged with the King's Guard. Dalinar eventually gave stewardship of the guard over to Bridge Four and reassigned the original members of the King's Guard to fill other positions that Sadeas's betrayal created in the structure of the Kholin army.

## Post Battle of Narak
After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Bridge Four along with the Kholin army took up residence in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Having discovered that Bridge Four were now all [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] [[Squire\|squires]], [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] released them from duty. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] most likely reassigned new members to the King's Guard at this time; however, those positions were likely temporary since [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] soon traveled with [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].

## Current Status
The King's Guard is presumed to be dissolved, but possibly reformed into a Queen's Guard following [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] taking the throne of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].
