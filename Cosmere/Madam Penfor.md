**Madam Penfor** is the matron of Pashadon Hall, a female dormitory of [[Elendel University\|Elendel University]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
Wayne—who is antagonistic to Madame Penfor—describes her as unattractive and built like an ox, with hair that curls like horns. She wears a small hat as part of her efforts to keep up with the current fashions in [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. She likes to consider herself part of Elendel upper society, and is likely of [[Noble\|noble]] descent. She has a stern demeanor and is not easily intimidated, leading Wayne to refer to her as the "Tyrant of Pashadon".

## History
[[Wayne\|Wayne]] had to meet with Madam Penfor every month when he visited the university to bring [[Allriandre\|Allriandre]] her stipend. She monitored the entrance to the hall and was familiar with Wayne, whom she considered a scoundrel and miscreant. She had previously told him not to return to the dormitory because he distressed Allriandre, but he always persisted. On one occasion, she seemed prepared to physically fight him if necessary; he instead bribed his way past her using tickets to [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]] that he had stolen from [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Steris\|Steris]]. After accepting the bribe, Madam Penfor allowed Wayne into the visiting room and warned Allriandre that he was drunk, although he immediately sobered up using [[Feruchemy\|feruchemical]] [[Gold\|gold]].
