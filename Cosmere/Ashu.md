## Appearance and Personality
He wears fine clothing with rich, bright colors as is common in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]]. However, he has long hair, counter to typical Hallandren high-class style.

## Attributes and Abilities
Ashu possesses a minimum of fifty [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breaths]], as [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] notes that he is of at least the First [[Heightening\|Heightening]]. This extends his lifespan and gives him the ability of Aura Recognition.
He is among the most influential slumlords among the Idrian expatriates in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]]. His position as a slumlord presumably makes him wealthy, and he is able to afford fine clothing and bodyguards.
He is known to run an illegal Idrian boxing ring.

## History
[[Denth\|Denth]] set up a hard-to-get meeting between [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] and three powerful Idrian slumlords, including Ashu, to discuss the prospect of war between Hallandren and Idris. Ashu disagreed with Vivenna about a war being inevitable. If a war did occur, Ashu seemed to be solely interested in how he would personally benefit. Vivenna felt bitter disappointment at the self-serving attitudes of the slumlords, and stood to leave; Ashu remarked that the meeting was a waste of time. Ashu and the other slumlords fled when [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] sent by the city watch attacked the meeting; one of the slumlords was captured and later freed, although it is not clear which one.

## Trivia
Brandon cites the slumlord scene as an instance where there are distinct characters that each have their own perspectives, but the differences between them are not significant to the plot. When this occurs, he tries to provide adequate detail for readers to imagine the scene, but not so much that it bogs down the action.
