When Amaranta believes that Straff has driven Zane from his warcamp, she plans to withhold the drug and kill Straff as payback for his prior abandonment and for taking Zane away from her. Straff manages to summon his last bit of strength to kill Amaranta and ingest a variety of drugs, hoping that one of them will save his life.
