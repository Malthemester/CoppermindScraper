The **Expanse of the Densities** is the [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] term for the [[Sel\|Selish]] subastral of the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. After [[Splinter\|Splintering]] [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]], [[Odium\|Odium]] pushed their [[Investiture\|Investiture]] into the Cognitive Realm. Due to the contained nature of the space, that Investiture is in an incredibly dangerous and highly pressurized state, similar to plasma. This Investiture fills the region as a deadly storm known as the [[Dor\|Dor]] and is the reason Rosharans call the region the Expanse of the Densities. It strains [[Hoid\|Hoid's]] resources to safely travel there, but he has done it on occasion. As a result of this high concentration of Investiture outside of the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], there may be noticeable  in the region.
It can be accessed from [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Devotion's Perpendicularity]] near [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], the other [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]] on Sel, or by traveling there from another region of the Cognitive Realm; it is adjacent to to the [[Nexus of Truth\|Nexus of Truth]] on the Rosharan map of [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]].
