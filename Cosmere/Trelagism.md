## Beliefs
Trelagism was a  religion named after the god **Trell**. Trell's opposite was **Nalt**, and the two were believed to be brothers. Trelagists believed that night was beautiful and daylight was profane. During the night, Trelagists were able to see the "Thousand Eyes of Trell" (the stars) watching over them. Jealous of the worship given to his brother, Nalt would shine his single eye (the sun) on the land during the day, blocking Trelagists from seeing Trell's eyes. Despite Nalt's attempts to outshine his brother, the Trelagists believed that Trell continued to watch over them during the day.
Their beliefs concerning the afterlife are described by [[Sazed\|Sazed]] as "almost whimsical," and their doctrine in general was left intentionally ambiguous on many issues in order to allow followers to "discover truth for themselves." Adherents were encouraged to pray to Trell, and believed that their god would respond to petitions.

## History
### Classical Scadrial
Before the Final Empire eradicated Trelagism, it was practiced primarily by a people known as the **Nelazan**. The Nelazan people lived in northern Scadrial, likely in close proximity to the planet's . Sazed notes that their winters had few hours of daylight, and their summers had few hours of darkness. These extreme day-night cycles evidently factored into their religious beliefs. Little is known about the Nelazan themselves. Sazed considers them to be a "determined" people, as evidenced by their accomplishment of counting and mapping every planet and major star in the night sky, and they apparently placed great value on the study of mathematics and astronomy--a trait which attracted Sazed to the religion personally. Sazed doesn't consider them to be very advanced, however. There were, however, some of the Terris who chose to practice Trelagism.

### The Final Empire
The original adherents of Trelagism were eliminated by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], however some [[Terris\|Terris]] [[Keeper\|Keepers]] were able to recover their star charts and record their beliefs. Trelagism was the fifth religion that Sazed offered to [[Vin\|Vin]] not long after she joined [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] crew, hoping she would appreciate their mutual preference for the night. Sazed later considered the religion for himself, but was discouraged by the lack of clarity that it offered. After his [[Final Ascension\|Ascension]], Sazed used the Trelagist star charts to return Scadrial to its original orbit.

### Post-Catacendre
Trelagism may have diverged from its original beliefs after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]], [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]], and others are self-proclaimed followers of [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trellism]], which they believe traces its roots to the religion of Trelagism as described in the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]]. The true relationship between Trelagism and Trellism is unclear.

## Cosmere
There is no substantial link between Trelagism and the dualist religion of the [[Purelake\|Purelakers]] concerning [[Nu Ralik\|Nu Ralik]] and [[Vun Makak\|Vun Makak]]. It is unclear whether the god Nalt has any connection to the planet [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
