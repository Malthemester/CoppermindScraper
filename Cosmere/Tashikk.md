## Geography
Tashikk is located in southwestern Roshar, in the southernmost part of the geographical region of [[Makabak\|Makabak]]. It lies on the northern shore of the eastern [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]] and borders [[Liafor\|Liafor]] to the West, [[Yezier\|Yezier]] and [[Azir\|Azir]] to the North, and [[Emul\|Emul]] to South-East, the latter on a river.
Tashikk appears to be rather flat, with wide, grass-covered fields. Local fauna and flora includes [[Axehind\|axehinds]], a species of deer-like, herbivorous crustaceans that live in herds; [[Drop-dead\|drop-deads]], tall, spindly trees so called for their ability to lie flat on the ground when a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] comes; and a species of moss that grows between ground and loose rocks, sticking the two together to protect itself. [[Cremling\|Cremlings]] are noted as particularly unusual in Tashikk compared to the ones found further North and East.
Tashikk has only one known major city, [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]], likely its capital. South of Yeddaw is also the town of [[Ifaba\|Ifaba]].

## History
During the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], Tashikk was part of the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. It's uncertain when they split off from it. At some point, they joined the Azish Empire as a member state.
Shortly before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] began, the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Nale\|Nale]] was travelling across Tashikk with [[Szeth\|Szeth]] and several other [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]], tracking down and killing new [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] in a misguided attempt to prevent a new Desolation. This ended with the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], when Nale departed, leaving Szeth behind. He would later come back and take him to the [[Purelake\|Purelake]].
[[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] used the Tashikki relay stations to warn the world about the Everstorm. He later contacted the prince of Tashikk to get him to join his coalition, but the prince refused to commit, waiting for the decision of Azir. When the Azish decided to ally with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Tashikk did as well, and they sent the Tashikki ambassador in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] to the tower-city as their representative.
[[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] later used Tashikk to spread the information about the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] and break up the alliance. While Azir did leave the coalition in the aftermath, whether Tashikk did as well is unknown, as several other member states, such as [[Yezier\|Yezier]] and [[Emul\|Emul]], remained.

## Politics
### Ties to Azir
Though ruled by an unnamed prince, Tashikk is part of the Azish Empire, a union of states led by the king of Azir, the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]]. Historically, it's considered to be the state closest to the Azish throne, alongside [[Yezier\|Yezier]]. Among others, this gives Tashikk access to the  Imperial Shardblades, which they can rent out from Azir for their own purposes. The Tashikki maintain an ambassador in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] for diplomatic purposes, with the current one being the prince's brother.

### Military
The Tashikki fleet possesses numerous ships, including troop carriers and scouts. In times of peace, their duty is to patrol the grand waterway, though which body of water this refers to is unclear. Additionally, the fleet is closely tied to Azir. The ships are partially staffed by battalions of Azish troops, and in times of war, the Prime can use them for their own purposes.
The Azish military presence in Tashikk is not limited to its ships. The credentials of achievement, issued to soldiers by Azish viziers, are valid in the country, and many Azish soldiers find employment there both as guards and in combat duty.

### Information trading
Even beyond the Azish Empire, Tashikk is Roshar's greatest [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] hub, and the reeds connected to it are used even as far East as [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. More than simply a relay station, Tashikk provides spanreed services to the entire world, distributing them and providing connections. They are also well-known for their ability to acquire information from all over, and sharing it for outrageous prices. Rumours and gossip traveling the world often start in Tashikk.

## Culture
### People
The people of Tashikk are ethnically Makabaki, with dark brown skin. They are known to be polite and reserved, even compared to their northern neighbors. Much like the Azish, the Tashikki are highly formal, and their society is highly bureaucratized. Alongside [[Sphere\|spheres]], information is considered a valid currency among them.
Both men and women typically wear [[Shiqua\|shiquas]], complex, one-sheet wraps covering their entire body, including the face. The exceptions to that include guards, who need clothing that's easier to move in, and diplomats, who will sometimes use more common, international styles when abroad, presumably to fit in.

### Religion
The Tashikki shiqua is religiously-motivated -- it is worn to protect the wearer from the eyes of **Nun Raylisi**, an evil entity that represents [[Odium\|Odium]] in their religion.
Opposing Nun Raylisi is the god **Tashi** (the local name for [[Ishar\|Ishar]]), also known as God of Gods and Binder of the World. He is assisted by the Nine, a group of entities who "bound the world" together with him (presumably the other [[Herald\|Heralds]]). It is believed that Tashi protects the Tashikki in their home nation, and so they usually forego the face covering there, but keep it on when abroad.
In [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]], the last of the ten types of pancakes made during the [[Weeping\|Weeping]] is dedicated to him, though unlike the others, it is metaphorical, thought about rather than physically made. The name Tashikk likely derives from Tashi.
