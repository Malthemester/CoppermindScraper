\-Wink giving advice to Alcatraz.[1]


**Wink** is one of [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz Smedry's]] [[Mokia\|Mokian]] advisors during the battle for [[Tuki Tuki\|Tuki Tuki]]. He advises Alcatraz along with the other two advisors, [[Dink\|Dink]] and [[Mink (Alcatraz)\|Mink]], with whom he is not related.

## Appearance and Personality
Wink is tall and thin, with a long neck and spindly arms. Alcatraz likens his appearance to a bottle of soda.

## History
During the battle and prior to meeting up with Alcatraz, Wink’s mind was affected by a Librarian disharmony grenade, which confused his brain. He continued to give good advice, but about random and un relevant topics. At Alcatraz’ orders, Mink and the other counselors went to fetch him some backpacks full of explosive teddy bears, six of their fastest warriors, and a pair of very long stilts. They hesitated briefly, but did as asked.
