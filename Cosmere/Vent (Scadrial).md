>“*The lass is a bit paranoid, but she’s not that bad. I swear, that man was so jumpy that his own heartbeat could startle him.*”
\-Dockson on Vent[1]

**Vent** is a skaa who lived in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Vent knew [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and [[Dockson\|Dockson]]. He is an extremely nervous and jumpy man. When Kelsier met Vin, he was reminded of Vent, although Dockson insisted that she was not as bad. As Kelsier and Dockson spoke of Vent in the past tense, it seems likely that he was dead by the point they met Vin.
