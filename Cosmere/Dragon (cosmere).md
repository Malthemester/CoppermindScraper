**Dragons** are a sapient species within the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Originally, they came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]], but can now be found, though apparently in small numbers, on other worlds. They are one of Yolen's three sentient species, alongside humans and [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]].

## Characteristics
Dragons are intelligent and inherently ageless. They are also more suited towards long lifespans.
They have the ability to shapeshift, taking on the form of different species, including humans; how much a dragon can shapeshift depends on an unknown factor. When the dragon is transformed, there is no apparent sign that it's not the species it's presenting as. Their shapeshifting method is different to that of the [[Kandra\|kandra]], even if the result is similar.
In their true forms, they are not necessarily large; some are smaller than [[Sandling\|sandlings]], while others can be as large as [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]]. They have four legs, as well as a pair of massive wings that allow them to fly. Their skin is covered with pearlescent scales, as well as silvery streaks that run along the body. Despite their nonhuman form, they are still able to speak with a human-sounding voice.

## Presence in the Cosmere
 by  botanicaxu  [[Hoid\|Hoid]] with [[Frost\|Frost]]
For a list of known dragons, see :Category: Dragon (cosmere).
Two dragons are known to exist, both of them still alive since the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]]. One is [[Frost\|Frost]], living on Yolen. He has some relationship with the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]], and actively corresponds with [[Hoid\|Hoid]] while the latter is on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Though not a worldhopper, he has significant knowledge of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
The other is [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]], the original Vessel of [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]], though she prefers to hide her true form, even when speaking to other Shards. She is the only dragon on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is the only dragon that is currently a Shard.
It's possible that other dragons are also around, but they have not revealed themselves. How much other inhabitants of the cosmere know about them is unclear. On [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], dragons are part of the local mythology, with the phrase "dragon's nest" referring to a highly dangerous place. On [[Roshar\|Roshar]], dragons are effectively unknown to its modern-day inhabitants. It's possible that they were known in the distant past, as there exists old artwork depicting dragon-esque creatures.
Even before the Shattering, dragons were much more cosmere aware than other races, and a few may have gone off-world.

## Trivia
Though still present in the cosmere in background roles, dragons will not become major players until *Dragonsteel*.
Brandon likes dragons a lot; they are also the only classical fantasy race to feature in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
[[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] wasn't a dragon.
