## Ecology and Geography
Braize is a cold, barren, inhospitable world, perhaps outside of the sun's habitable zone, as a result it contains no life. It contains no vegetation or native life on its surface, however it does have an atmosphere due to the fact it has wind and the the surface is known to not be a vacuum. However it is home to an ecosystem of self-aware [[Spren\|spren]] as well the [[Fused\|Fused]]. Only Odium's spren are welcomed there as well as his allies; for those not aligned with him, visiting is both difficult and dangerous.

## History
Prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] Braize was formed in the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]] by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. For the majority of its history the planet was inhospitable and uninhabited.
It was during the initial clashes between [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Odium\|Odium]] on its closest neighbour, [[Roshar\|Roshar]], that its first inhabitants would arrive to Braize. As part of an effort to halt Odium Honor deliberately bound him to the planet in order to stop his conquest of the [[Cosmere\|Cosmere]]. As part of this the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]] was formed which also bounded the [[Herald\|Heralds]] and [[Fused\|Fused]] to the planet. As per the pact so long as the Heralds did not choose to leave the planet the Fused would also be unable to escape, once however the Heralds broke and chose to return to Roshar the Fused would follow suit causing a [[Desolation\|Desolation]] on Roshar. After many years of torture the Heralds began losing their sanity and decided to abandon the Oathpact at the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]] leaving only [[Taln\|Taln]] behind. This exile from Roshar lasted 4500 years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] began allowing the Fused to permanently live on Roshar.
Braize primarily served as a prison planet for the Fused and holds no inhabitants besides them,  this makes it the third of the three planets in the Rosharan system to hold sentient life. The only type of [[Spren\|spren]] that are welcomed on world is Odium spren. Because of its inhabitants and the presence of Odium the world is considered unsafe by outsiders. Despite the native population being bound on Braize they can still influence Roshar and [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] due to their proximity and the way [[Connection\|connection]] and [[Identity\|identity]] works between the three worlds. 

## Prison
Braize's most important function is that of a prison. [[Odium\|Odium]] has been trapped there following his battle with [[Honor\|Honor]], and after every [[Desolation\|Desolation]], the [[Fused\|Fused]] are forced to return to Braize. While Odium is kept bound by Shardic power, they are kept sealed by the presence of the [[Herald\|Heralds]]. As long as the Heralds remain on Braize, Odium's forces cannot travel to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. To counteract this, Fused hunt them down and torture them until at least one gives up, restarting the cycle. Because of this, [[Taln\|Taln]] has spent the past four and a half thousand years there. Dead [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], on the other hand, do not go to Braize.
Even following a Herald breaking, departing from Braize is difficult, and grows more so the more powerful the prisoner is. Some smaller [[Voidspren\|voidspren]], like [[Ulim\|Ulim]], are capable of sneaking out even while the torture remains ongoing; the [[Fused\|Fused]] and [[Thunderclast\|thunderclasts]] can only come out once the Heralds leave; and Odium's most powerful servants take a long time to cross over even after a Desolation is already in full swing.
Odium himself cannot be released quite so easily - only someone holding the majority of Honor's power can set him free, and only by [[Intention\|Intention]]. To be freed is something Odium seeks above all else, and he is convinced that it will eventually happen.

## Culture
In the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] religion, Braize is known as [[Damnation\|Damnation]], although it is referred to by its proper name in older songs. Those who have committed particularly grave sins are supposed to go there after death. It's unclear how much it figures into other Rosharan cultures - the Shin know about it, but the [[Iri\|Iriali]] Long Trail does not include it.
Unlike the rest of [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]], Braize is based around the number nine rather than ten. Like all other [[Shardworld\|Shardworlds]], it has a representation in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], although its name and nature are unknown.


## Trivia
Some people on Roshar believe that Braize is inhabited with people.
The Iriali never visited Braize.
