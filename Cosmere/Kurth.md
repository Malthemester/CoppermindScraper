## Geography
Kurth is situated in northwestern Roshar, a warm area of the continent. The city is on an island in the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]] just off the east coast of the main Riran landmass. Kurth is on the west side of the island.
Kurth was once the capital of the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Rishir\|Rishir]]. Despite Kurth's seemingly remote location in Rishir's territory, an [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] was constructed there to serve the kingdom and its people. After the Silver Kingdoms era, Rishir became the modern-day [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]], but the island that contains Kurth ended up as part of the nearby nation of Rira. Kurth is likely the largest city in Rira.

## History
While planning how to unite the nations of Roshar in the wake of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], members of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] coalition hoped to open and secure the Kurth Oathgate. However, Rira did not respond to Dalinar's attempts at diplomacy. The [[Iri\|Iriali]], who claimed Rira as a vassal, held a grudge against Dalinar for marrying [[Evi\|Evi]] after she had taken a set of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] out of Rira; they flatly refused to work with him. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the forces of [[Odium\|Odium]] secured the area by allying themselves with the Rirans and Iriali; Odium's forces presumably controlled Kurth and its Oathgate as the war began in earnest.

## Culture
The origin of Kurth's nickname as the "City of Lightning" is not known. However, the city is well-known even in rural [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. In his youth, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] heard stories about Kurth, [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]], and other exotic-sounding locales that encouraged his desire to join [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas's]] army in order to see what other lands are like.
