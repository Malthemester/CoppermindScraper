The **invasion of Arelon** took place on the planet of [[Sel\|Sel]] just before [[Raoden\|Raoden]] and [[Sarene\|Sarene]] were crowned king and queen of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]].
Under the instructions of [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]], the armies of [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] entered [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and attacked Elantris and [[Kae\|Kae]]. They slaughtered New Elantrians and citizens of Kae alike and gathered all Elantrians and survivors into New Elantris, where they piled the Elantrians and the [[Hoed\|Hoed]] together to burn, and grouped the humans together to go afterwards. A few of the humans took a last stand, but were defeated.
As this happened, Raoden was taken to the [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Pool]] by [[Galladon\|Galladon]] and [[Karata\|Karata]], after being mortally wounded. He resisted the Pool's release and ran down to Elantris to fix the [[Aon\|Aon]] it represents. As a result, the Elantrians' [[Reod\|Reod]] completed, and they started beating the invaders back.
Dilaf kidnapped Sarene and, with [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]], jumped to [[Teoras\|Teoras]], where King [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]] waited to surrender. Raoden followed and the [[Battle of Teoras\|Battle of Teoras]] began.
