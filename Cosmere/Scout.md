>“*We're not cowards. The DDF makes it very clear that we're not. But you might have to deal with a . . . a look now and then. It's part of the sacrifice we all make to see that the Defiant Caverns are kept safe.*”
\-Blaze to Arturo.[1]


A **scout** is a position that can be held by pilots in the [[DDF\|DDF]]. Cadets train with scouts during their time at [[Flight School\|Flight School]] and have the option to become a scout after they graduate. There are at least fifteen scouts in the DDF, including [[FM\|FM]]; however, three are killed in the initial firefight and nine by a lifebuster bomb, during the Battle of Alta Second. During this battle, instead of being organized in larger squads, the scouts were split into five trios. The three scouts that survive the lifebuster return to Alta with Riptide Flight to aid Spensa, Kimmalyn, Nedd, and Arturo in defending the base from the second Krell attack.

## Job
Scouts are tasked with patrolling the skies and reporting incoming [[Varvax\|Krell]] forces both during and outside of battle. They look for low-riding Krell by their dust trails, as well as for Krell hiding behind hills, and teach cadets how to tell whether or not something off in the distance is a Krell ship or an optical illusion. If they see an incoming force of Krell, scouts are also tasked with holding them back to buy time for the other Flights to get off the ground and provide backup. Scouts are sometimes viewed as cowards, but they understand that their job is essential to the survival of the DDF and humanity, because without them, the Krell would catch the DDF off guard and unready.

## Equipment
Scouts are given [[Val-class\|Val-class]] ships, with its 138 Stewart destructor swapped out for a 131. Its sensor systems are better than the average ship -- they have longer range and higher resolution.
