**Burn ink** is a flammable ink used on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]].

## Properties and Characteristics
Burn ink's most important characteristic is its flammability. It is designed to burn while either wet or dry, no matter the surface it is painted on. This allows for its use in [[Glyphward\|glyphwards]], which are prayers to the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] that are burned. The ink itself is blood red in color.

## History
After Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] was betrayed by Highprince [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] at the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], Brightlady [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] made use of burn ink to craft a glyphward for Dalinar and [[Adolin\|Adolin]]. She used four pots of burn ink to paint a *thath* glyph on the ground, which she burned in a prayer for justice.
