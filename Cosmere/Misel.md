**Misel** was a young [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
She was [[Nanrovah\|Nanrovah's]] daughter, and was kidnapped by [[Denth\|Denth]] to use as leverage. The kidnapping was used as leverage to force Nanrovah to support the war against [[Idris\|Idris]], and her return allowed him to retract his support.
Misel was kept in a dingy cage in a thieves' den. [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] and [[Vasher\|Vasher]] rescued her, and walked her back to her father's house. She is returned to [[Nanrovah\|Nanrovah]] and a woman, believed to be her mother. The rescued child was clearly traumatized and non-verbal, but Vasher had Vivenna back away and then asked Misel to repeat a Command he told her, which appeared to cause her to completely forget her dreadful experience.
With Misel restored to him, Nanrovah argues to prevent war with [[Idris\|Idris]] at the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]].
