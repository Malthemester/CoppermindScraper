## Attributes and Abilities
Eondel is a capable commander and instructor with his own private army, as well as a skilled swordsman.

## History
Before Raoden was taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] and thrown into [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], Eondel supported his movements and taught him fencing. When [[Sarene\|Sarene]] came to [[Kae\|Kae]], he supported her in her plan to overthrow King [[Iadon\|Iadon]]. He helped Sarene give fencing lessons to the noble ladies. He also helped her take supplies into Elantris for her Widow's Trial and saved her from being killed by one of [[Shaor\|Shaor's]] men.
Eondel had a personal army, which was accepted to be the most effective fighting force in Arelon.
After Sarene's plans were foiled by [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] and Duke [[Telrii\|Telrii]] became king, Count [[Ahan\|Ahan]] betrayed the group, causing Telrii to attack them. [[Roial\|Roial]] was killed in the assault, causing the returned Raoden to reveal himself and Telrii to flee with his men. Later, Eondel led his men to an attack on the palace in order to avenge Roial and retake the throne for Raoden. He personally slew Telrii but then died from previously received wounds. He was buried in one of the graves dedicated to those who had fought for Arelon alongside [[Saolin\|Saolin]], [[Karata\|Karata]], [[Roial\|Roial]], and [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]].
