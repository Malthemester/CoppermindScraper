The **skaze** are [[Splinter\|Splinters]] of [[Dominion\|Dominion]] that live on [[Sel\|Sel]]. The skaze have many similarities to the [[Seon\|seons]] that also live on Sel. Like the seons, they appear as sapient floating spheres of energy that can converse with humans. Unlike the seons, however, the skaze are very rarely seen or discussed in [[Arelon\|Arelon]].

## Appearance and Composition
While the seons glow with light and have an [[Aon\|Aon]] at their center, the skaze are described as dark, seeming to suck in the light around them, with indistinct edges that blend into the air. Skaze also have a ring around their sphere with a "pattern of misty symbols". The skaze have some relationship to and may be named after Dominion's [[Vessel\|Vessel]] [[Skai\|Skai]]. This is similar to the relationship of seons to [[Devotion\|Devotion's]] Vessel, [[Aona\|Aona]].

## Disposition
Most likely due to Dominion's intent, the skaze are "pretty thirsty for power". The skaze are "reliant upon humankind", but it is not known if they have masters like the seons. It is unknown if the skaze were affected by the [[Reod\|Reod]].

## History
They have a large amount of influence in the politics of [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] and strongly influence the [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]]. [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]], the leader of the Dakhor, had information from the skaze that the [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] were not indestructible.
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] made some kind of agreement with a group of skaze in which he promised to become an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]], but he failed to do so. The partnership between them was fairly loose. When he discovered that he had failed, he was in the company of a skaze who displayed a surprising level of emotion and humor, causing him to reflect on the fact that the skaze had a wide range of individual personalities.

## Similarities to spren
Skaze have many similarities to the [[Spren\|spren]] that live on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Like spren, skaze can turn into [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] if they have something to pull them more into the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. Skaze can also be used to build a [[Fabrial\|fabrial]].

## Trivia
Brandon has referred to them as "evil seons".
