**Harth** is a swordsman from [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He was [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] first sword trainer.
[[Dalinar's father\|Dalinar's father]] hired Harth to train a young Dalinar in swordsmanship. The Kholin family was not particularly powerful at the time, and had to settle for Harth even though he was young and not recognized as a true swordmaster. He came from "a few towns over" to train Dalinar. Dalinar believes that Harth had a reasonable level of skill for someone of his standing.
[[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] tells [[Kadash\|Kadash]] a tale of Harth insisting that he tie his [[Takama\|takama]] in a specific way, the same way that Harth's master and his master's master had always demanded. Dalinar seeks out the originator of this rule, an old [[Ardent\|ardent]] in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], and realizes that he only tied it that way because he was so short. Dalinar uses this tale to argue that blindly following tradition does not make it worthy.

\-Tradition? Kadash, did I ever tell you about my first sword trainer?
