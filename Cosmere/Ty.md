## Appearance and Personality
Ty is one of the older Skybreaker squires. [[Szeth\|Szeth]] is able to immediately identify him as the leader of a small group of squires. He is competitive and strategic.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a Skybreaker squire of the [[Immortal Words\|Second Ideal]], Ty has access to the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Gravitation. He is skilled with Basic Lashings, as he and his team are able to fly in formation and pursue Szeth effectively. He likely would have won the contest at the Purelake had it not been for Szeth's presence.
He is presumably a squire to either [[Ki\|Ki]] or [[Warren\|Warren]], as they were the only two Skybreaker masters present at the contest.

## History
As a Skybreaker squire, he trained at the Skybreaker fortress in [[Marabethia\|Marabethia]].
He was among a group of twenty-one squires that participated in a martial competence test over the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], testing their ability with [[Basic Lashing\|Basic Lashings]]. The squires had to throw bags of colored powder at each other and avoid getting hit by bags, which left colored marks on their white clothing. During the test, Ty led a group of four squires that attacked other individuals as a team, minimizing the return fire. They noticed that Szeth was winning the contest and focused their attention on him. Szeth was able to hold his own against the group, even hitting Ty in the face with a bag. However, Szeth ran out of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and was pelted with bags, landing in the Purelake just before the test ended. Ty finished with only five hits against him, and was shocked when the masters agreed that Szeth won via a loophole; he was cleansed of color by swimming in the lake.
