**Dai-Gonarthis** is believed to be one of the [[Unmade\|Unmade]], an ancient and terrible [[Spren\|spren]] of [[Odium\|Odium]]. They also seem to be known as the **Black Fisher**.
[[Hessi\|Hessi]] posits in *Mythica* that Dai-Gonarthis may have been involved in the [[Scouring of Aimia\|scouring of Aimia]], although she's unsure of the specifics. She also expresses uncertainty that they are one of the Unmade at all. However, it seems likely that Dai-Gonarthis is truly the final Unmade, as [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]], in the guise of Ahu, refers to the Black Fisher together with two other Unmade‚Äî[[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] and [[Moelach\|Moelach]]‚Äîduring one of his conversations with [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. Additionally, the name Dai-Gonarthis is used in a [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattle]] collected by the [[Silent Gatherer\|Silent Gatherers]] in a manner similar to Death Rattles about the Unmade Re-Shephir and [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]].

## Trivia
The name Dai-Gonarthis is most likely derived from , an ancient Canaanite deity later reimagined as a Lovecraftian sea god.
