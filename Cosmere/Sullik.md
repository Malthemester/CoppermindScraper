>“*I’ve seen your type, with that haunted look. You’ll get yourself drunk, then pick a fight. I don’t care what it is you want to forget; go find some other place to do it.*”
\-Sullik to Veil when he cuts off her alcohol[1]


**Sullik** is the owner and bartender of the bar [[All's Alley\|All's Alley]] in the [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] [[Breakaway\|breakaway]]. He is a larger man, who may or may not be [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] and who wears a [[Takama\|takama]]. He has hired a number of lower class lighteyed thugs, including [[Betha\|Betha]] and [[Ur (character)\|Ur]], to provide protection for his bar.
He is aware of the [[Rem\|murders]] that occurred near the bar and is wary of authority figures looking into the incident out of fear that they would shut down the bar.
He keeps [[Horneater white\|Horneater white]] at the bar as a joke. He does not know what the liquor is made from, however, knows that it works well as paint stripper. He knows when to cut patrons off and has little tolerance for people who are likely to cause trouble in his bar.
When [[Shallan\|Shallan]] questioned him about the murders that occurred, he refused to tell her details and instead pointed her in the direction of his hired thugs.
