**B. Sablerfils** is a playwright on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
He composed the historical operetta *A Hero for All Ages* with [[Buissonommes\|Buissonommes]], telling the story of [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend\|Elend]]. The operetta played at [[Clarvonne's Theater\|Clarvonne's Theater]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] in 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]].
*A Hero for All Ages* was presumably successful, as Sablerfils mentioned it in an advertisement placed in *The New Ascendancy* later that year. Sablerfils was recruiting students for his "scientific fantasy" writing classes at the University of New Seran.

## Trivia
Sablerfils loosely translates from French to English as "Sanderson", and the character is a writer and teacher, much like [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]]. [[Peter Ahlstrom\|Peter Ahlstrom]] has confirmed that Sablerfils is a cameo for Brandon that was inserted into the broadsheets by [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]].
