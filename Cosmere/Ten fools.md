## Cultural Use
The ten fools are invoked to describe someone who is very foolish. Each fool is known for a specific foolish attribute, and has a representative [[Glyph\|glyph]] known to [[Vorin\|Vorin]] [[Ardent\|ardents]]. Specific fools are often referenced in order to emphasize that particular foolish trait. All of the characters who have mentioned the ten fools are [[Alethi\|Alethi]] or [[Veden\|Veden]], implying that the ten fools are not well known in modern Roshar outside of the Vorin religion.
[[Pai\|Pai]] invokes the ten fools in a bold protest against Queen [[Aesudan Kholin\|Aesudan Kholin]] and the Alethi government, and is executed for her actions.

## Origin
The fools represent the antitheses of the [[Immortal Words\|ideals]] of the ten [[Herald\|Heralds]]. The number of fools stems from the nature of [[Honor\|Honor]] and each fool corresponds to a specific Herald. Unlike the Heralds, it is not yet known if the ten fools are based on historical individuals.
