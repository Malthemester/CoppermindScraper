## Cover Synopsis
>“*All her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she’s a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumors of his cowardice are true—he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them.*
\-Spensa is sure there’s more to the story. And she’s sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the starsand it was terrifying. Everything Spensa has been taught about her world is a lie.


## Summary
For a complete chapter by chapter summary, see Summary:Starsight.
During a battle with the Krell a couple months after the [[Battle of Alta Second\|Battle of Alta Second]], a alien named [[Alanik\|Alanik]], of the [[UrDail\|UrDail]] species, crashes on Detritus and gives Spensa the opportunity to take her place and spy on the Krell. Alanik was cytonic like Spensa, and imprinted the coordinates for a place called [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]] in her brain. Spensa hyperjumps for the second time and finds herself at the center of bureaucracy for the [[Superiority\|Superiority]], the alien organization that had kept humans imprisoned on [[Detritus\|Detritus]] for decades.
Spensa pretends to be Alanik and tries out for the Superiority's new [[Superiority\|Delver Resistance Project]], hoping to discover the secret to hyperdrives. She trains in a flight with [[Vapor\|Vapor]], a non-corporeal [[Figment\|figment]]; [[Morriumur\|Morriumur]], a [[Dione\|draft]]; [[Hesho\|Hesho]], former king of the [[Kitsen\|Kitsen]]; and [[Brade\|Brade]], a tamed and registered human. After they report for practie, Hesho renames their flight (originally called Flight 15) [[Flowers of Night's Last Kiss Flight\|Flowers of Night's Last Kiss]].
After discovering that the secret to cytonic hyperdrives was not a piece of equipment but an animal species called [[Taynix\|taynix]], of which [[Doomslug\|Doomslug]] was a member, Spensa talked with [[Cuna\|Cuna]] and learned that [[Winzik\|Winzik]] was planning to use the [[Delver\|delvers]] to destroy [[Detritus\|Detritus]]. Cuna was of a more moderate faction that fought to preserve humans. She returns to her homeworld to help them fight off the massive invasion force coming to them and has to leave M-Bot behind, although she finds out when she comes back that he's copied his code into the drone they used for spying.
Spensa first directed the delver away from Detritus toward [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight (station)]] to buy time, but then comes to save it by showing the delver her point of view. She was brought to an infirmary after she was found floating in space and got caught up in Winzick's coup d'etat.
