**Indelebrean** is an enchanted sword belonging to [[Kairominas\|Kairominas]]. It was likely a treasure that Kai found while adventuring in his youth, and is implied to have been used frequently and to great effect by Kai. Kai could not take Indelebrean with him into [[Maltese\|Maltese]] as it was incompatible with the programming.
