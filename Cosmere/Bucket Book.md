>“*After all, the Bucket Book was sacred. A ledger of true excellence. A list of impossible feats that saluted both Hershel and me in notarized record.*”
\-Jax[1]


The **Bucket Book** is a book of several hundred challenges that [[Jax (Reckoners)\|Jax]] and [[Hershel\|Hershel]] are racing to complete. Each time one of the two completes a challenge, they write their initials next to it, and get a point. They are both competing to have the most points. The small notebook has a worn black cover, and the lettering is barely legible.

## Challenges
#7: Throw a person a distance of over 9 feet.
#31: Break the sound barrier without use of vehicular power.
#97: Take down a bear without using a bullet or blade.
#111: Rip a phone book in half.
#170: Evel Knievel your way through a window without splattering against a wall.
#171: Make it back alive.
