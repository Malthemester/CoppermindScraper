>“* Our leaders know exactly what they’re doing. Them I obey. But I am the one who escaped, the spren of redemption. I don’t have to listen to you.*”
\- Ulim to Venli[1]


**Ulim** is a [[Voidspren\|Voidspren]] who worked with [[Venli\|Venli]] to bring about the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. Among the [[Fused\|Fused]] he is known as the **Envoy** for his role in ushering their Return.

## Appearance and Personality
Ulim appears in a red, human form. Venli describes his eyes as odd, suggesting a Shin ethnicity, or possibly non-[[Roshar\|Rosharan]]. He has long hair that ripples as if being blown by wind, and his size is typically small enough to fit on the palm of a hand. When particularly passionate, his form seems to electrify. When moving across surfaces, Ulim appears as rolling lightning. He can move through the air in a sudden bolt of lightning but seems to require a surface of some kind to rest on. Ulim can render himself invisible at will, and used that capability to hide from most Listeners for years.
Ulim often speaks with an arrogant, spiteful attitude marked by human mannerisms, as noted by [[Hariel\|Hariel]]. He has little compassion or respect for the [[Listener\|listeners]], despite having worked closely with Venli for many years. He addresses them as children, mocks their war against the [[Alethi\|Alethi]], and treats Venli's mourning over the loss of Eshonai with derision. In contrast, Ulim speaks with deference when in the presence of the Fused, for whom he has great fear and respect.

## History
>“*Well, do you want to guess how long we’ve been fighting this war? Go ahead. Guess. I’m waiting.*”
\-Ulim to Venli[1]

Ulim somehow managed to escape from [[Braize\|Braize]] to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He made contact with Venli several years ago and convinced her that they should work together to bring about the return of her people's gods. The pair collaborated secretly to capture [[Stormspren\|stormspren]] and make the discovery of [[Stormform\|stormform]]. Though Venli took credit for the research, Ulim was primarily responsible for the work performed.
After the summoning of the Everstorm, Ulim revealed himself to the surviving listeners and became somewhat of a leader to them. He directed Venli and others to search in the chasms for Eshonai's body in order to claim her [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] before pressing them to meet up with the Fused. He instructed Venli, [[Demid\|Demid]], and seven other listeners on how to prepare themselves to be taken by the souls of the Fused at the coming of an Everstorm.
