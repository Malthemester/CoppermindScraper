## History
 by  Séverine Dumagny  With [[Ashe\|Ashe]]
Sarene became an ambassador for Teod at a very young age, serving most notably as the ambassador to [[Svorden\|Svorden]].
In an attempt to re-establish diplomatic relations with [[Arelon\|Arelon]], Sarene arranges a political marriage with [[Raoden\|Prince Raoden]]. She meets and gets to know Raoden by communicating through letters, and later by [[Seon\|seon]]. When she arrives in Arelon, however, she finds out that Raoden has died of [[Shaod\|"disease"]]. A clause in the marriage contract states that the death of either her or Raoden qualifies as a marriage, so she finds herself a widow, and legally the daughter of [[Iadon\| King Iadon of Arelon]].
She spends the first three months of her "married" life working to block the efforts of a [[Gyorn\|gyorn]] named [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] to convert the people to [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] and thus add both Teod and Arelon to the massive Fjordell Empire. In addition, she works with Raoden's group of friends to attempt to change Iadon's system of government. She also brings food to the Elantrians were she meets Raoden under the Name Spirit, and teaches a group of Arelene noblewomen, including [[Eshen\|Eshen]] and [[Daora\|Daora]], fencing, in an attempt to give them some agency in the court.
Hrathen eventually gets to [[Telrii\|Telrii]], a rich nobleman, and promises to place him on the throne if he converts to Shu-Dereth. When Iadon commits suicide, Sarene realizes that the only way to keep Telrii off the throne is to combine her fortunes with [[Roial\|Roial's]] through marriage. On the day of the wedding, however, Hrathen poisons her to make her look like she has undergone the Shaod, and she is thrown into Elantris. After five days in Elantris, when the poison wears off, she and Raoden realize that she was not truly an Elantrian, and she returns to [[Kae\|Kae]].
She convinces the people to accept Raoden as their king even though he is an Elantrian, but then the Derethi priests attack Arelon, capturing Sarene, along with the rest of her allies and family in [[Kae\|Kae]]. She is taken to [[Teoras\|Teoras]] by [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]], where he attempts to use her to make King Eventeo surrender to the Derethi. With the aid of Hrathen, Raoden, [[Galladon\|Galladon]], and other Elantrians, she fights off the Derethi invasion and saves both Kae and Teod from Dilaf's attack.
Afterward, she is married in a grand ceremony to Raoden, and becomes the Queen of Arelon. She becomes pregnant by him after.
