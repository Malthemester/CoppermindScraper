**Forescout** is a surname taken by the first family of those from the [[Homeland\|Homeland]] that settled in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]]. Many others came later, but the Forescouts were the first. They are, and have always been, people who lived by the forest, as opposed to the fortfolk, who are more civilized, but choose to ignore the forests instead of becoming one with them. The Forescousts are extremely proud of their heritage. They claim that they can look the forests "dead on", while the fortfolk and others look away. The Forescouts have lived through many dangers, and can be very harsh, as a way of teaching their children how to survive in the Forests of Hell.
