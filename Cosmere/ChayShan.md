## Prerequisites
In order for a ChayShan user to access the [[Dor\|Dor]] a few things have to occur. It appears that a ChayShan user has to be [[JinDo\|JinDo]].

## Mechanics
[[Shuden\|Shuden]] claims that ChayShan is simply a way to focus a warrior's mind and body before battle, but he later uses it while fighting [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]] monks. ChayShan is practiced via a meditative martial arts style that appears to focus on speeding up motions and gaining power from them, which then appears to draw upon the Dor. As all the [[Investiture\|Investitures]] on [[Sel\|Sel]] are form-based, it is quite possible that the different forms and moves of the ChayShan are what determine what powers a practitioner is using.
A person using ChayShan moves their body in specific circular patterns, slowly gaining in speed. The person continuously keeps their hands and legs moving. They move as though they are "struggling against some unseen force" with their muscles tensed. The leaps and arm motions of ChayShan seem similar to a dance. When the Dor is actually being accessed, a dim glow is visible in the wake of the motions of the limbs of the practitioner. If a person using ChayShan loses focus, they lose access to the Dor and must start over.

## Abilities
One of the abilities granted by ChayShan is enormous strength. Someone performing ChayShan is capable of breaking the ribs of a Dakhor monk and hitting one in the head so hard that the spine breaks, despite the fact that a Dakhor monk's body is enhanced to the point that even [[Kiin\|Kiin]] needs to hit one several times with his axe before it dies. Another ability that ChayShan grants is intuitive spatial awareness, as Shuden performs all of his motions in battle with his eyes closed.

## Relationship To JinDo
ChayShan has a specific tie to the land of JinDo. Like all Selish magic, ChayShan will decrease in power the further from JinDo a user gets.
