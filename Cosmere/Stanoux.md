Lord **Stanoux** is a linguist and a member of the [[Set\|Set]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
Lord Stanoux made a study of ancient anteverdent languages, becoming one of Scadrial's foremost experts on the subject. At some point he came into contact with the [[Set\|Set]], and joined their ranks. He and his aunt, Lady [[Stansi\|Stansi]], traveled to the city of [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] in the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] to visit the Set compound that had been built around the wreck of *Brunstell*. Stanoux came to attempt to decipher the Malwish language in the books found aboard. He was given a tour of the ship along with Stansi, Professor [[Javie\|Javie]], and two other scientists by [[Irich\|Irich]], expressing interest in the woodwork and patterns inscribed in it. Stanoux asked after the crew of the ship, wondering if any had survived. Like the rest of the scientists, he appeared concerned by Irich's talk of dominating the Basin. Irich assuaged his fears by assuring them that the technology was better off in their hands than those of Elendel and appealing to his sense of curiosity about what they could learn from the ship. He and the rest of the group began investigating their ship as Irich left them to deal with another matter.
