## Appearance and Personality
She is a tall [[Darkeyed\|darkeyed]] [[Alethi\|Alethi]] woman with luscious black hair and tan skin. Beryl has delicate, supple fingers. Her personality is described as sunny despite her history.

## Abilities
Beryl is a Lightweaver bonded to Ornament. She can instinctively use [[Illumination\|Lightweavings]] to change her own appearance and sometimes does this subconsciously. However, Beryl has not learned how to Lightweave anything other than herself yet. She attempted to use drawings to form Lightweavings like [[Shallan\|Shallan]], but is horrible at drawing. She is skilled at using [[Transformation\|Soulcasting]] and finds that by carrying around [[Lavis\|lavis]] seeds it is easier to transform things into lavis grain. She has shown [[Vathah\|Vathah]] this trick and he agreed it was easier to Soulcast with the seeds.

## History
Beryl was once a prostitute in the warcamps on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. At sometime while still a prostitute she bonded the [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] Ornament to become a Lightweaver. Using her newfound abilities she began to change her face to match the faces of her clients' loved ones. A rumor of a prostitute changing one's face in the warcamps eventually led Shallan to Beryl, where she was recruited about three months prior to the expedition to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]].
Beryl then became an apprentice in the [[Unseen Court\|Unseen Court]], where she was trained to use her powers and fight. Beryl was one of the five Lightweavers brought on the mission to capture [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] in the warcamps.
Beryl showed great interest in being one of the three Lightweaver apprentices to go on the mission to Lasting Integrity when Shallan told her and the rest of the Unseen Court. However, Shallan chose to bring Vathah, [[Ishnah\|Ishnah]], and [[Stargyle\|Stargyle]] instead of Beryl.  Then right before the party was set to leave [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] Stargyle‚Äôs wife became ill and he backed out of the trip, letting Beryl take his place on the expedition into [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]].  During the trip there Shallan temporarily believed Beryl was the spy for [[Mraize\|Mraize]] and the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]], particularly after she feeds her a tidbit about a corrupted gloryspren and Mraize repeats it.
After [[Adolin\|Adolin]], Shallan, and [[Pattern\|Pattern]] were let into Lasting Integrity, Beryl and everyone else except [[Godeke\|Godeke]], [[Felt\|Felt]], and his wife [[Malli\|Malli]] left for the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] to tell [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] what had happened.

## Other
Beryl is not her real name. She claims not to remember her real name anymore. [[Ornament\|Ornament]] rides inside her shirt, near her skin. Beryl has not yet earned her [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
