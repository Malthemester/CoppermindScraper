>“*In a Herdazian woman's home, nobody's station means nothing beside her own. I'm not going to have them come and get you and find you not properly fed!*”
\-Lopen's mother to Elhokar Kholin[1]

**Lopen's mother** is a [[Herdaz\|Herdazian]] woman on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Lopen's mother is ethnically Herdazian. She speaks [[Alethi\|Alethi]] with a thick accent. She can be extremely forceful in her personality, especially in her own household. She likes to cook and feed people, and she keeps [[Axehound\|axehounds]].
Lopen describes his mother as "wise". She encouraged his self-deprecating jokes back when he was still missing his left arm, telling him to laugh before others could laugh at him. She also appears to have some influence among her relatives. One of Lopen's cousins, [[Punio\|Punio]], decided to join [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] after hearing Lopen's mother mention that they needed help.

## History
At some point during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], she and her family moved to Little Herdaz, a section of Highprince [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. When a wounded King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] was recovering in Little Herdaz, Lopen's mother forced the king to eat despite his objections. She said he looked pale, and she did not want Elhokar found when he was not properly fed.
She presumably moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with most of the population of the warcamps after the tower city's rediscovery.
