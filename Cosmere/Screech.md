**Screech** is a pet [[Skyeel\|skyeel]] kept by the crew of the *Wandersail*. Screech was well-liked by the crew and hunted rats onboard for them. During the voyage to [[Akinah\|Akinah]], Screech was killed by [[Nikliasorm\|Nikli]] in one of his attempts to frighten the crew into turning back by creating bad omens. Screech's death indeed gave the crew pause due to their superstitions stemming from the [[Passions\|Passions]], but they pressed on since their orders came directly from Queen [[Fen\|Fen]].
Nikli used [[Blackbane\|blackbane]] to kill Screech. He later tried to frame [[Cord\|Cord]] for the skyeel's death, but Rysn figured out that he was the true culprit.
