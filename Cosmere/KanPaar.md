## Appearance and Personality
KanPaar uses a tall [[True Body\|True Body]] made out of red crystal and keeps the rest of his body translucent. He has a thick accent, which is supposedly similar to that of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]].
KanPaar is of the Second Generation, giving him authority just below that of the First Generation among the kandra. He is an administrator who spends almost all of his time in the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]]. KanPaar believes that all the members of the Third Generation are miscreants, and that the Second Generation, including him, was mistaken in giving the Thirds too much freedom.
KanPaar believes the [[First Contract\|First Contract]] forbids kandra from killing other kandra, thought the contract does not specifically says so. He is greedy, wanting to use the wealth of the [[Atium\|atium]] cache to rule mankind. He also refuses to believe that the world is ending, thinking that Ruin isn't really free.

## History
>“*You aren’t here to defend yourself; this is not a trial—you have already admitted your guilt. This is a judgment. Explain your actions, then let the First Generation pronounce your fate!*”
\-KanPaar to TenSoon.[1]


### Early History
As a member of the Second Generation, KanPaar was created by the [[First Generation\|First Generation]] through [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic spikes]] provided by the Lord Ruler. KanPaar has spent centuries trying to prove that the kandra of the Third Generation are untrustworthy. KanPaar personally assigned [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] to [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]].

### TenSoon's trial
KanPaar was the primary speaker during the trial of [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]]. He accused TenSoon of killing a fellow kandra, but TenSoon said he was only following his Contract, obeying his master [[Zane\|Zane]]. Then, KanPaar accused him of having broken his contract, disobeying his master. TenSoon replied that he was following the First Contract by obeying [[Vin\|Vin]], whom he said was the Lord Ruler's heir. He said he revealed to Vin the secret of controlling the kandra, because she deserved to know it.

### The Coup of the Second Generation
When [[Sazed\|Sazed]] came to the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]], proposing to compare the things he'd discovered about the Terris religion to the knowledge of the kandra to discover what [[Ruin\|Ruin]] had changed, KanPaar refused him. However, the members of the First Generation dismissed the kandra, wanting to speak with Sazed. Soon after, KanPaar and the rest of the Second Generation lead a coup against the First Generation, imprisoning them and taking control.
KanPaar then discovered the [[Atium\|atium]] cache in the Trustwarren, and made plans to sell some of it, revealing the cache's location to [[Ruin\|Ruin]] in the process. KanPaar refused to follow the [[Resolution\|Resolution]], instead leaving the Homeland to sell some of the atium. However, Ruin took control of KanPaar, and [[Marsh\|Marsh]] took the atium, which he later used to extend his life via [[Compounding\|Compounding]].

## Relationships
### TenSoon
KanPaar sees TenSoon's crimes as an opportunity to prove that the Third Generation is untrustworthy, with TenSoon's reputation of being the most temperate among the Thirds. He thinks TenSoon is a criminal and disagrees with him on whether killing another kandra violates the First Contract.

### Sazed
KanPaar believes that Sazed can't really be the Announcer, because he believes the world isn't ending. He thinks Sazed blasphemes by claiming to be the Announcer. Sazed thinks that KanPaar and the other Seconds are typical aristocrats, easy to identify in any society.
