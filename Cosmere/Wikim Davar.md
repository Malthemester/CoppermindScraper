## Appearance and Personality
 by  Marie Seeberger 
Wikim Davar is the older twin and third son of the Davar family. Wikim is slender, pale, spindly, and with sunken eyes. His hair is cut so short he almost looked like an [[Ardent\|ardent]]. He shares some resemblance to his twin [[Jushu\|Jushu]], but they would not be mistaken for one another.
After his mother's death Wikim probably suffers from depression: he is so thin he looks sickly, he rarely talks or smiles, and he has suicidal thoughts. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] helps him get out of the depression by pushing his interest in math. After this, Wikim starts laughing again and becomes more interested in his studies. He even talks of becoming an ardent. He is not the affectionate type and always complains about hugs. One of his prominent personality traits is that he is thoughtful.

## Attributes and Abilities
Wikim likes math and seems to be proficient at it. He also seems to have biology knowledge, as he knows the effects of [[Blackbane\|blackbane]]. After his father's death, he takes care of distracting creditors and seems to be able to keep them at bay for some time; this means he does have some political abilities.

## History
 by  zoethatcher art  With his parents and siblings
When Wikim was younger, his [[Shallan's mother\|mother]] wanted him to be an ardent. After her death, he fell into depression, being a constant target of his [[Lin Davar\|father's]] anger. He would rarely speak, or even smile, and would stay long times staring at fires or walls. He did resent his father and when the [[Highprince\|highprince]] sent his bastard son to their house seeking for people who would speak against him, Wikim asked [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to do so.
At the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] he decided to stay in the carriage, where Shallan went to visit him. Wikim saw through her and openly asked about her tricks for making all her brothers feel better. After stating that no woman or sword would do the trick with him, Shallan gave him math problems that she had spent lots of time creating for him. Though he dismissed the effort and her, making Shallan feel miserable, he ended up taking a pencil and trying them with a smile on his face.
After that day, he slowly came out of his depression. He almost always had math problems with him, at which his father first railed, but the [[Ardent\|ardents]] stood up and said this was the Almighty's wish. Wikim started laughing again and even talked of becoming an ardent himself. One day, he thanked Shallan for her help and gave her a pouch with [[Blackbane\|blackbane]]. He explained this plant would paralyze and even stop breathing; he had it because he had been thinking about suicide, but didn't need it anymore. He also explained the plant would become more powerful with time.
The day [[Balat\|Balat]] was going to run away with [[Eylita\|Eylita]], Wikim was the one to let him know his father had summoned her to their house. Along with [[Jushu\|Jushu]], he stayed at the door of the feast hall while Father and Balat argued. They ran in when his father went to the floor paralyzed, thinking he was dead. Shallan explained she used the pouch he had given her years ago. Wikim was the one who found out he was still alive and stepped back. Shallan had to step in to finish the job.
After his father's death, and while Shallan tried to steal [[Jasnah\|Jasnah's]] [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]], Wikim helped Balat with their house affairs. His role was to keep the creditors distracted.

## Relationships
### Shallan
>“*I was wrong. About what you're doing. I see through it. And... and still it’s working. Damnation, but it’s working. Thank you.*”
\-Wikim to Shallan[5]


[[Shallan\|Shallan]] spends much of her time trying to make her brothers feel better. In the case of Wikim, she spends time preparing math problems for him. This helps him get out of his depression, and he expresses his gratefulness by giving her the pouch of [[Blackbane\|blackbane]] he doesn't think he needs anymore. Shallan loves him very much, and seeing him smile makes her feel warm inside. He does love her back, but complains when she shows him affection.

### Lin Davar
Wikim's [[Lin Davar\|father]], just as he does to his other sons, screams at and mistreats him. Although Wikim hopes to become an ardent, Lin likely would never allow him to, as he feels that in the absence of [[Helaran\|Helaran]] and [[Balat\|Balat]], Wikim is the best one to lead the [[House Davar\|house]]. His father opposes his interest in math until he is convinced by his [[Ardent\|ardents]] that the Almighty approves of his interest.
