The **ironhull** is a type of steam-powered ship from the [[Eelakin Islands\|Eelakin Islands]] on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]].

## Characteristics
>“*We have two ironhulls armed with cannons watching the waters. Those can take on even a deepwalker, if they have to.*”
\-Vathi[1]


The ships are "enormous" in size and outfitted with cannons. Although ironhulls have the capabilities of a warship, they are not used in battle, but rather for traveling through the dangerous seas near the [[Pantheon\|Pantheon]] islands. The waters of the Pantheon contain massive creatures known as [[Deepwalker\|deepwalkers]], and the reinforced hulls of the ships are intended to defend against the deepwalker's attacks. The cannons mounted on the ships are quite powerful, as they are able to kill a deepwalker.

## History
Vathi notes that the Eelakin people have only recently worked out marine propulsion, implying that the ironhulls are brand new technology; this rapid advancement in marine engineering was likely influenced by the [[Ones Above\|Ones Above]]. Ironhulls are used as mercantile ships by the [[Northern Interests Trading Company\|Northern Interests Trading Company]], transporting equipment and personnel to the Pantheon, where the Company traps [[Aviar\|Aviar]] for resale. [[Eusto\|Eusto]] and his team bring at least two ironhulls on the [[Patji expedition\|Patji expedition]]. [[Dusk\|Dusk]] sees a "mountainous" deepwalker carcass near the Company's fortress on [[Patji (island)\|Patji]], confirming the capabilities of the ships.
