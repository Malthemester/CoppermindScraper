The **Grips** are a gang of thugs in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] (in her Veil persona) starts bringing food to displaced people in the city including [[Grund\|Grund]], [[Tai\|Tai]], [[Muri\|Muri]], [[Ma\|Ma]], and [[Seland\|Seland]]. Unbeknownst to Shallan, her conspicuous actions quickly attract the attention of the Grips. They start forcing the refugees to wait all day for Veil's deliveries; Grund says that they beat him if he leaves his post or tries to take any food for himself. The Grips also blame Grund if Veil does not bring much food.
Shallan eventually realizes that something is wrong, and discovers the Grips eating as Grund watches. The Grips are spooked, and one of the gang members smashes Grund's head open before fleeing. Before dying, Grund tells Shallan that he hates her, and that the Grips had already killed Tai due to the attention that Veil drew. Seland and Ma have already abandoned the area, and Muri plans to do the same. Shallan blames herself for being so naive and causing more harm than good, and is particularly guilt-ridden about Grund's death.
[[Wit\|Wit]] arrives and tries to console Shallan, telling her that other people in the market had asserted themselves against the Grips, forcing them to give up Grund's murderer and disperse.
