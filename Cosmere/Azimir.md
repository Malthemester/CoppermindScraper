## Geography
Azimir is located in the southern part of the country, near the border with [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] and [[Emul\|Emul]]. Its location is well-protected from highstorms. It is one of the larger cities on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], with population exceeding that of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], and far greater population density.

## History
Azimir is one of the oldest cities on the planet. That it has its own [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] implies that it might've been the capital of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]], the [[Silver Kingdoms\| Silver Kingdom]] within whose lands it would've laid during the Heraldic Epochs.
In 1173, the city saw a string of assassinations as [[Szeth\|Szeth]], under orders from [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], assassinated [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] after Prime Aqasix as they were being elected, leading to a succession crisis as prospective candidates grew too fearful to apply. At the same time, the city was visited by the herald [[Nale\|Nale]], who was hunting [[Lift\|Lift]] for her [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]]. The meeting between them in the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] led to Lift revealing her abilities and [[Gawx\|Gawx]] being elected the new Prime after she healed him.
Following the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], the former [[Parshmen\|Parshmen]] left the city, and attempted to sue the government for their back pay. While the negotiations took place, the Azish intended to destroy the city's [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. However, those plans were abandoned after [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] convinced the Azish government to join his alliance and the Oathgate was unlocked by Lift for easy access to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], while the negotiations with the [[Singer\|Singers]] broke down with the arrival of the [[Fused\|Fused]].

## Landmarks

The [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] is the seat of the [[Azir\|Azish]] government, and the home of the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]]. Its name comes from it being mostly made out of bronze through [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]]. This includes not only its walls and spires, but also trees and decorations.


The city's indoor shopping district, an enormous building covered by a bronze dome. It is located on top of the city's [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] platform. Upon learning of this fact, the Azish emptied it out and transformed it into a fort to protect against possible [[Alethkar\|Alethi]] invastion, thinking that only the contents of the control chamber could be teleported.
