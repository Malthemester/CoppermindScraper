### Physical Realm
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], mistspren resemble the shimmer light makes on a surface when it is reflected through a crystal. When they stay still, light grows upwards from them in the shape of plants, which retreat when they start moving.
When Enlightened by [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], they take on a different form -- that of a red crystal dripping light upward.

### Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], mistspren have bodies made out of fog, and a porcelain mask on their face. Their clothes are not part of their essence, but interact with their body as though it was solid. Their masks twinkle when they catch the light, and almost appear to be made of translucent crystal. The mask's expression does not change, and the lips do not move when the mistspren speaks. Though they generally are humanoid, mistspren are capable of taking on other forms, unlike most sapient spren. Mistspren voices seem to have a tinkling or chiming quality.
It is unknown how a corrupted Mistspren would appear in the Cognitive Realm.

## Abilities
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], mistspren can change their form into non-humanoid shapes. It's unknown how much control over their form they have in the Physical, although the corrupted spren, at least, can hide themselves inside the bodies of their bonded [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]]. They can also enter the [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] of various creatures; in case of [[Cremling\|cremlings]], this gives them some ability to control their direction.

### Nahel bond
They can form a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] to make a person a [[Truthwatcher\|Truthwatcher]], in exchange for retaining their sapience in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. Ordinarily, they grant their partner the abilities of [[Progression\|Progression]] and [[Illumination\|Illumination]], allowing for healing and creating illusions. In a bond altered by [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], the Progression surge is retained, while Illumination isn't fully functional. However, Enlightened mistspren grant their partner the ability to see visions of the future. In a more advanced bond, the mistspren can also record the vision and re-view it later.

## Culture
 by  FelCandy 
Mistspren in general are curious; the idea of seeing something through a new perspective, or finding out how other creatures think, seems interesting to them. Perhaps for this reason, they are the most willing to be Enlightened by [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], and many go to her willingly to be transformed. They seem highly empathetic and supportive of their [[Knights Radiant\|Radiants]]. They aren't opposed to bonding [[Singer\|singers]], though it's unknown how prevalent this attitude is among them.
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], many mistspren work aboard [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] ships as regular crewmembers. They are noted as doing all the work aboard the ships, but do not seem to be particularly despondent about it. Despite being able to assume many different shapes, they generally prefer using a humanoid one. There seems to be two prevalent naming schemes among them - descriptive, like [[Dreaming-though-Awake\|Dreaming-though-Awake]], and seemingly meaningless, like [[Glys\|Glys]] and [[Tumi\|Tumi]]. It's unclear if this is because Dreaming-though-Awake comes from a different culture than the others, or if the latter two took on new names upon being Enlightened.

## Notable Mistspren
[[Glys\|Glys]] (bonded to [[Renarin\|Renarin]])
[[Tumi\|Tumi]] (bonded to [[Rlain\|Rlain]])
[[Dreaming-though-Awake\|Dreaming-though-Awake]] (bonded to [[Arshqqam\|Arshqqam]])
## Trivia
Mistspren weren't originally intended to be Radiant spren.
