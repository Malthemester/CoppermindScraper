**Tathingdwel** is a city in the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]]. It is south of the [[Channerel Range\|Channerel Range]], and is presumably named after [[Tathingdwen\|Tathingdwen]].
It may be a popular home for the descendants of the [[Terris\|Terris]] people.
[[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] commented that if one wished to sell metals in Tathingdwel, one would need to pass through [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. She used this to drive home a point that some outside Elendel think that Elendel has too much power in the [[Elendel Basin\|Basin]]. Her comment might imply that Tathingdwel has a large market for metals, perhaps due to its Terris population, which could require metals for use in [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]].
