**Wyrn** is the title given to the emperor of [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] and the leader of the [[Shu-Dereth\|Derethi]] church on [[Sel\|Sel]]. The title is based on the founder of Fjorden, who was named [[Wyrn (character)\|Wyrn]].
The Wyrn resides in a palace in [[Widor\|Widor]] which is called [[Zigareth\|Zigareth]].
According to the doctrine of Shu-Dereth, the Wyrn is the only individual that can serve [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] directly. All other members of the church are bound to other members of the religious hierarchy below Wyrn, with him at the top and the [[Gyorn\|Gyorns]] and [[Gragdet\|Gragdets]] directly beneath him.
The current Wyrn, [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]], perpetrated the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]]. Recent Wyrns have also used [[Seon\|seons]] for communication, entrusted one to each of their gyorns so that any gyorn would be able to contact them and discuss important matters, even when separated by incredibly long distances. This was a matter of utter secrecy, since the seons are believe to be [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] constructs. One such seon was used by [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] to communicate with Wyrn Wulfden during his mission in [[Kae\|Kae]]. The seons were kept locked away in strongboxes to ensure their secrecy while not being used, and the Wyrn's own personal seon was attended to by a mute servant at all times.
