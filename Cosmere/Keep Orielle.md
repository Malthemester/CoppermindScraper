**Keep Orielle** is a keep in [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].
The keep is not as imposing as [[Keep Venture\|Keep Venture]] but it is still impressive. The keep's main hall, which also serves as the ballroom, is constructed from white marble with intricate stonework and rows of ornamental marble pillars. It also includes floor-to-ceiling stained-glass panels of "masterpiece" quality that are used to partition and decorate the room. The hall holds hundreds of people, but the relatively low ceilings give the room an intimate feel.
Keep Orielle was the setting of a lavish ball on the first night of the [[Siege of Fadrex City\|siege of Fadrex City]]. [[Vin\|Vin]] learned of the ball from [[Slowswift\|Slowswift]]. She and [[Elend\|Elend]] attended the ball, arriving at the doors by [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] flight. It was the first time that Elend openly revealed himself to be a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], and he and Vin used the ball as an opportunity to show their strength to the assembled [[Noble\|nobles]], including [[Aradan Yomen\|Aradan Yomen]] and [[Lady Patresen\|Lady Patresen]].
