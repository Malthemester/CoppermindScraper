>“*Sel—home to multiple empires that, uniquely, have remained somewhat ignorant of one another. It is a willful kind of ignorance, with each of the three great domains pretending that the others are mere blips on the map, barely worth notice.*”
\-Khriss[3]


**Sel** is a Shardworld of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] and is the setting of the books [[Elantris (book)\|Elantris]] and [[The Emperor's Soul\|The Emperor's Soul]], as well as the short story [[The Hope of Elantris\|The Hope of Elantris]].
Sel is inhabited by humans and artificially created beings called [[Seon\|seons]] and [[Skaze\|skaze]]. This Shardworld is a relatively large planet, being 1.5 times the size of the [[Yolen\|cosmere standard]], and contains diverse landscapes home to multiple great civilizations including at least three empires.
Another name for the planet is Seol. People from Sel are called Selish.

## Astronomy
The location of the planet Sel within the larger cosmere is as-yet unknown, though it is known to orbit a yellow star named [[Mashe\|Mashe]] while in turn being orbited by a single moon named **Oem**. Its size is 1.5 [[Cosmere standard\|cosmere standard]] and its gravity is 1.2 cosmere standard.

## Geography and Culture


### Opelon/Sycla
The story of *Elantris* and the short story *The Hope of Elantris* are both set on a continent on Sel called **Opelon** by those in the west and **Sycla** by those in the east. There is a vast desert to the south of the known nations of the continent.


Most nations on Sycla have been subsumed into the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]]. The empire is ruled by a leader known as [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]], who is also head of [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], which has been used as a vehicle to dominate nations. The Fjordell Empire is, on the surface, completely Derethi. However, many of the people of the empire, especially those in backcountry areas like Hrovell, still secretly follow their old religions, like the [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jeskeri Mysteries]].
The Fjordell Empire is made up of the following nations:


[[Fjorden\|Fjorden]]
[[Duladel Republic\|Duladel Republic]]
[[JinDo\|JinDo]]
[[Jaador\|Jaador]]
[[Hraggen\|Hraggen]]
[[Geant\|Geant]]
[[Hrovell\|Hrovell]]
[[Svorden\|Svorden]]


Located to the west of the Fjordell Empire, [[Arelon\|Arelon]] is the only remaining independent nation on Opelon. The capital of Arelon is the city of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], which is a monarchy ruled by the [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] King [[Raoden\|Raoden]]. Under the king, there is a class of nobles who control various plantations throughout Arelon. Their primary function is to distribute food to the people of Arelon. Arelon controls the area to the west of the Atad Mountains, and south of the northern ocean. Arelon is mainly made up of followers of the [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] religion, although there are still remnants of the old pagan religion that worshiped the Elantrians. There is also a small number of followers of the Jeskeri Mysteries.

### The Northern Continent
There is another continent north of Opelon. No official name for this continent has been revealed.


The nation of [[Teod\|Teod]] is located on a small peninsula attached to the northern continent. The capital of Teod is Teoras, and its ruler is King [[Eventeo\|Eventeo]]. Teod's martial strength exists mainly in the form of its navy, which dominates the northern sea, protecting Teod's borders from the Fjordell Empire. Unlike the rest of the northern continent, Teod is within Opelon's cultural sphere of influence. For example, the nation's state religion is [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]], which originated in Opelon. The Teo people are also of [[Aonic\|Aonic]] descent and are therefore related to the [[Arelene\|Arelene]] and [[Dula\|Dula]] people of Opelon.


North of the Teod peninsula, beyond the mountains, is the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]]. This empire has many provinces, including but not limited to [[Mulla'dil\|Mulla'dil]], [[MaiPon\|MaiPon]], [[Dzhamar\|Dzhamar]] and [[Ukurgi\|Ukurgi]]. The empire maintains a little-used mountain pass that leads to Teod. Unlike Teod, the Rose Empire has limited cultural exchange with the nations of Opelon, though it has some diplomatic relations with [[Svorden\|Svorden]] and [[JinDo\|JinDo]]. By the time of the assassination attempt on Emperor [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]], they seem to have made contact with the Fjordell Empire, as a southern ambassador with [[Gyorn\|red priest's armor]] is present while [[Shai\|Shai]] is rushing through the palace. Certain segments of the population seem to have a concept of [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]].
The story of [[The Emperor's Soul\|The Emperor's Soul]] is set on the Rose Empire.

### Aonic Calendar
The Aonic calendar is used by the people of Arelon and Teod. It has at least six months, with Eostek being the sixth, and at least six days in a week, with MaeDal being the second and OpeDal being the sixth.

## History
### Early History and Mythology
At an unknown date the planet was settled by [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]] against the rules made by the original Vessels. [[Odium\|Odium]] used this as justification to attack both of the Shards, this battle resulted in their Splintering. Their Investiture was then moved from the Spiritual Realm into the Cognitive to prevent anyone else from taking the Shards. This latent Investiture became dangerous plasma and was named the [[Dor\|Dor]] and some of these [[Splinter\|splinters]] became the [[Seon\|seons]] and [[Skaze\|skaze]]. They were created from the Investiture of Devotion and Dominion respectively. Because of this, the world's magic systems became region specific. These consequences were a side effect of Odium's actions, he didn't intend them to happen.
Three major empires eventually formed on Sel. Due to the planet's size, these empires largely ignored each other and considered the others as irrelevant. One of the reasons for this isolation is the difficulty of travelling between the empires. Two such empires are the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] and [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]]. [[Shu-Keseg\|Shu-Keseg]] rose as a religion focused on the unity of all people. A schism later formed in the religion over a disagreement on what unity meant, this lead to the creation of the [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] and [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] traditions.
The original Fjordell empire was formed and the first [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] was created. The empire eventually collapsed three hundred years before the events of Elantris. Around this time a schism formed in the Shu-Keseg faith forming [[Shu-Korath\|Shu-Korath]] and [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]]. The remnants of the Fjorden empire blamed their collapse on a lack of true unity, as a result they adopted the newly formed [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] as the state religion, it was hoped that by doing so they would prevent any future rebellions or political problems. They mixed the Shu-Dereth faith with Fjorden mythology and made Jaddeth the central deity of their religion. A movement was begun to update their religious and historical texts in order to make it seem that Fjorden was always of this faith and that the first Wyrn also worshipped Jaddeth.

### The New Fjorden Empire
The monasteries of Fjorden were formed and began training their members. These monasteries and internal Fjorden politics began to be influenced by the Skaze, in particular their want for power. Overtime this new empire expanded so as to include most of the continent, with only [[Duladel\|Duladel]], [[Teod\|Teod]] and [[Arelon\|Arelon]] resisting them. By this time the new empire had become stronger than the original ever was, though their strength was in the power of their priests rather than military might. [[Wulfden\|Wulfden]] the fourth became the new Wyrn and leader of the Shu-Dereth church. Feeling threatened by this new Wyrn the leaders of Shu-Korath named [[Seinalan\|Seinalan]] as their new high priest because of their relative youth.
An earthquake happened near the city of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]], this earthquake then triggered an event known as the [[Reod\|Reod]] causing Elantris to fall. The earthquake was not due to natural causes. The native Elantrians became [[Hoed\|hoeds]] and Arelon government collapsed. The majority of damage and death during the resulting riots was caused by the countries servant class. After the riots eased the government was replaced with a system where the wealthiest ruled the country. The newly empowered merchant class blamed the riots on the servants of the city being too pampered. King Iadon was crowned in response.
Deciding that the new system of wealth based politics was unstable he secretly wrote a new law that was to take effect either fifteen years after it was written or after his death, whichever came first, he then entrusted this with Seinalan. The law removed the wealth based system of Arelon government and made its positions be determined by lineage like other nations, he based this model of Teod's. To foster peace with the Fjorden empire he also allowed for Shu-Dereth priests to preach to their people. Nevertheless the empire remained dissatisfied and a push was made by Fjorden to convert the leaders of Arelene from Shu-Keseg to Shu Dereth and have them pledge loyalty. The nation of Teod also spoke less with Arelon after the events of the Reod.
Gyorn Hrathen was assigned to convert Duladel to the empire, as it was one of the few remaining nations offering resistance. Within six months he managed to lead a revolution that led to the deaths of the republican class and collapse of its government. In its place a monarchy was formed and Shu-Dereth pronounced the state religion at the expense of to the [[Jesker\|Jesker]] religion. This event caused a renewed interest in an alliance between Teod and Arelon, a marriage was planned between prince Raoden and princess Sarene. Having successfully converted Duladel Hrathen was then dispatched to Arelon. Unknown to him [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]], his old mentor, was already dispatched to the area and preparing to invade it. Upon meeting Hrathen failed to recognize him and also misunderstood his orders as to convert the people of Arelon, not destroy them.
Before the marriage of Sarene and Raoden could take place Raoden found himself taken by the Shaod. An effort was made by Sarene to oppose Hrathen's preaching and his attempts to instate Telrii as the new king of Arelon. Telrii had agreed that if he became king he would make Arelon convert to Shu-Dereth. After Sarene discovered the King Iaoden was part of the religious cult known as the [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jeskeri Mysteries]] where he sacrificed women the king was dethroned. After this event king Iadon killed himself. To try and prevent the nation of Arelon from falling into Derethi control it was decided that Sarene had to marry [[Roial\|Roial]] in order to legitimize his claim to the throne.
Before the marriage the funeral of King Iadon took place and as per his will a new law was pronounced by Seinalan that reformed the Arelon government again. Hrathen managed to make it appear Sarene was taken by the Heod before her marriage stopping it. This led to Telrii being crowned king of Arelon. After this Telrii refused to follow through on the deal he made with Hrathen unless he was also made a gyorn as a gyorn held greater power in the Fjorden empire. He insisted on this despite Hrathen's protests that such a thing was impossible. Seeing this failure Dilaf then announced his true rank as Gragdet and the true nature of Hrathen mission. He then began the [[Invasion of Arelon\|invasion of Arelon]]. During the invasion Raoden worked out how to undo the Reod and restore Elantris. With their renewed power the Fjoredell army was removed and Raoden and Sarene were both crowned the new leaders of Arelon.
The Skaze for a brief time worked alongside Hoid. Hoid promised them that he could become an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]], when his efforts failed the Skaze mocked him for it.

### The Rose Empire
The Shu-Dereth religion never historically threatened the Rose Empire because they view its land as not holy. The Rose Empire was ruled by eighty factions, one faction for each sun that they believed existed. These factions then elect an emperor to sit on the Rose Throne.
Emperor [[Yazad\|Yazad]] died and under pressure from his faction [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]] put himself forward for the position. This was accepted and he became the new emperor. Initially he hoped to lead a series of reformations to help the empire His desire waned however and he became distracted with the bureaucracy of the empire.
The [[Glory Faction\|Glory Faction]] of the empire moved in and assassinated emperor Ashraven. His wounds were fixed by a [[Resealer\|Resealer]] however he was left brain damaged. Because his wife died as well his faction, the [[Heritage Faction\|Heritage Faction]] claimed that he was well and in his customary one hundred days of mourning. In desperation they turned to a [[Forgery\|Forger]] known as [[Shai\|Shai]] in order to recreate the Emperor's soul. She succeeded in these efforts and also escaped the country on the 98th day of her imprisonment. Ashraven had their soul recreated and they quickly worked out what had happened, his soul was made so that he would remember his old ideals and bring about the reforms he had wanted to as a youth.

## Invested Arts
Each [[Investiture\|Invested Art]] on Sel use symbols, shapes, or forms as "code" to direct magical effects. They are all powered by the [[Dor\|Dor]], making them end-positive. Because their power is coming from the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], the Selish Invested Arts are highly location dependent. The strength of each Invested Art decreases the farther one travels from its associated region, symbols in an Invested Art often come from the geography or culture of their region, and [[Initiation\|Initiation]] is often restricted to people from the associated region.

[[AonDor\|AonDor]] uses symbols called [[Aon\|Aons]], which can be drawn directly in the air as glowing light, or in a large variety of physical representations, such as etched into metal plates, or incorporated into the design of buildings. Anyone can learn to draw Aons, but they only have power when created by an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]]. AonDor is tied to the land of Arelon and is only practiced within its borders.
[[ChayShan\|ChayShan]] seems to be a type of meditative martial art practiced by the [[JinDo\|JinDo]], with the forms one moves through granting access to the Dor. It appears that, like Aons, these forms can be practiced by anyone without supernatural effect, with additional factors such as intent or bloodline establishing the connection to the Dor.
The monks of [[Dakhor Monastery\|Dakhor Monastery]] use an Invested Art often referred as [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]]. Dakhor monks have unnatural and twisted bone structures that form patterns under the skin. These bones are inlaid with ancient Fjordell characters, which are likely the symbols used to access the Dor. Some Dakhor magics, such as instant transportation, require human sacrifice.
[[Forton\|Forton's]] potions are Invested, likely derived from the Invested Art associated with [[Hrovell\|Hrovell]]. This suggests that, despite Hrovell being under Derethi rule, it maintains an Invested Art of its own. It is not yet known what forms are used to create these potions.
[[Forgery\|Forgery]] involves shaping a specific form, by the carving of a sort of stamp, and then the application of ink to the stamp, and then applying a mark onto the desired object or person. Supposedly the forgery helps the object (or soul) remember a different past, or a likely destiny in order to change the actual essence of the object. The symbols on the front side indicate what a soulstamp does; the "setting mark" on the back side indicates that the stamp is complete and looks like [[MaiPon\|MaiPon]].
[[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]], like Forgery, uses stamps, but they must be inked with fresh blood. Bloodsealers can mark a door, which will set their [[Skeletal\|Skeletals]] to attack the person from whom the blood came if they pass through the door.
People on Sel can also form bonds, similar to the [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], with [[Seon\|seons]] and [[Skaze\|skaze]]. Unlike the participants in the Nahel bond, people bonded to seons are not shown to gain direct supernatural powers themselves, instead requesting that their companions use their abilities. What advantage a skaze bond grants is not clear at this time.

## Cosmere
Sel is the most realmatically knowledgeable of the known Shardworlds. The planet is home to two [[Shard\|Shards]], [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion]], and their powers have influenced many Selish traditions, religions, and languages.
At some point in Sel's distant past, [[Odium\|Odium]] killed the [[Vessel\|Vessels]] of both Devotion and Dominion and Splintered the two Shards. The collective power of the Splintered Shards became somehow trapped in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], and is now what Selish people call the [[Dor\|Dor]].
Because of this, while travel to Sel is possible via the Cognitive Realm (for example, one can use a [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]] that exists in the form of [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|a pool of sapphire-colored liquid]] near Elantris), the raging uncontrolled power of the Dor makes travel through the Selish Cognitive Realm incredibly dangerous.
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] has visited both Arelon and the capital of the Rose Empire.

## Trivia
Initially, Brandon had the shadows of Elantris falling on the city of Kae at dawn. As Kae is to the east of Elantris, this indicated that the sun rises in the west on Sel. However, in the Anniversary Edition, this was identified as an error and corrected.
