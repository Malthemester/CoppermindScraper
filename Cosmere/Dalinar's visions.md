## Highstorms and visions
After he began listening to readings from [[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]] Dalinar began experiencing strange episodes during each highstorm. As each stormwall hit, Dalinar suddenly felt as though he had been transported to another place. The people he interacted with did not see him, but someone else in his place. The visions felt real to him, as he could feel pain. The visions often depicted places he had never been to, nor heard of, or were places he knew that were referred to by ancient names. He also saw the fabled [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] alive and in action. He surmised that the visions were from previous [[Desolation\|Desolations]] during the [[Shadowdays\|Shadowdays]]. Dalinar could not summon his [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] in a vision.
At first, Dalinar suffered these visions feeling he was going mad. Dalinar eventually volunteered to be tied to a chair, because he raved and thrashed about. Watching him was unnerving, and [[Renarin\|Renarin]] told him that he spoke gibberish during the visions. Though Dalinar thought that the visions might have been sent from the [[Almighty\|Almighty]], he wavered and felt uncertain about them. He spoke to the [[Ardent\|ardents]], but received no solution. Feeling he was losing his mind, Dalinar decided to abdicate his position as Highprince in favor of [[Adolin\|Adolin]]. In an argument about this topic, Renarin suggested that they try to prove whether the visions were fabrications or contained any real references. They decided to ask [[Navani\|Navani]] to document the visions.
This decision led to the discovery by Navani that Dalinar did not speak gibberish during his visions. During the first vision she witnessed, he spoke the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. They considered this proof that the visions were real. The Dawnchant was a real extinct language on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], but there were no known translation keys for modern scholars to study it. Since Dalinar would have had no prior knowledge of the Dawnchant they came to the conclusion that his mind could not be fabricating the visions. As a side effect, Navani was sure that this discovery would help to translate an old book called [[Analectics\|Analectics]].

### The Stormfather's Role
After settling in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] revealed that Dalinar is able to control and chose who experiences the visions. Dalinar was able to bring other people into the visions with him, and he used this ability to make initial contact with rulers to help build the alliance between the nations. Each time he entered a vision it would play out a little differently. Once, Odium came to him in a vision. After this, they deemed the visions too dangerous to use and only went in another time to bring in Venli and try to make a pact with the Voidbringers. [[Odium\|Odium]] interrupted this meeting, however.
The Stormfather imagined a place for Dalinar to discuss plans with him. The sky is deep black and the ground endless white stone. Items and even people made of smoke rise from the floor and slowly dissipate. This place represents how the Stormfather imagines cognitive ideas dying when no longer in use by cognitive beings.

## The visions predicate
All of the visions shared the challenge given by an unknown voice:

>‚Äú*You must unite them, the strange, booming words had told him. You must prepare. Build of your people a fortress of strength and peace, a wall to resist the winds. Cease squabbling and unite. The Everstorm comes.*‚Äù
\-Dalinar's memory from one of the visions[8]


From the visions shared statement Dalinar drew the conclusion that he had to unite [[Alethkar\|Alethkar's]] [[Highprince\|highprinces]] because only then would mankind have a chance to withstand the coming events. The visions led Dalinar to the decision to attempt to refound the Knights Radiant.

## Mentioned and recorded visions
### Starfalls
>‚Äú*This is important. Do not let strife consume you. Be strong. Act with honor, and honor will aid you.*‚Äù
\-The Almighty at the end of the Starfalls vision[7]


During this vision Dalinar found himself in the role of a man, [[Heb\|Heb]], who lived with his wife and daughter, presumably during the advent of a Desolation. Heb and his daughter were attacked by [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essences]], but managed to reach Heb's house unharmed. Two more of these beasts followed, and after Heb (Dalinar) fought them off with a metal fire poker, Heb took his wife and daughter and fled from the house. A short time later they were surrounded by Midnight Essences. When he and his family thought all was lost, two Knights Radiant arrived. One, a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]], immediately began to fight the beasts, while the second, a [[Stoneward\|Stoneward]] used a [[Regrowth\|Regrowth]] fabrial to heal Heb and his family before joining her companion in fighting the Midnight Essences. Feeling good again after the healing, Heb joined the fight, and the three of them fought off the Midnight Essences. The [[Starfalls Windrunner\|male Knight Radiant]] asked Heb about his strange fighting stances and invited him to come to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], where the Knights Radiant were centered, because everybody who could fight was needed. Dalinar asks questions of the [[Starfalls Stoneward\|female Knight Radiant]] as well.
This was Dalinar's twelfth vision.
He revisits this vision when meeting with Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen Rnamdi]], and he instructs the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] to let Fen experience it as he did so that they can discuss it after.

### A Highway to the Sun
Dalinar was in the role of a soldier named [[Leef\|Leef]], at a fortress called [[Feverstone Keep\|Feverstone Keep]]. He witnessed the Orders of the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]] and the [[Stonewards\|Stonewards]] abandoning their [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]], forsaking their duty to the people of Roshar. Though Dalinar tried to get an explanation for their abandonment from the leaving former Knights Radiant, he received none. The voice told him that "this event will go down in history" and Dalinar assumed that he just saw the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]].
Dalinar revisits the keep when meeting [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] and showing [[Navani\|Navani]] and [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] the vision. After the conversation with Gawx, Dalinar is returned to the vision to first meet [[Odium\|Odium's]] golden avatar, and then [[Lift\|Lift]] appears.

### That Which We Cannot Have
In this vision Dalinar was shown the aftermath of a Desolation. His role was as a man named [[Karm\|Karm]], an adviser to a king, probably [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]] himself. Nohadon was saddened over the vast destruction caused by a recent [[Desolation\|Desolation]], noting that the kingdoms of [[Tarma\|Tarma]] and [[Eiliz\|Eiliz]] were likely to fall from the loss of population; Dalinar concurred, realizing he's never heard of either. The king also wavered over what to do with the [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinders]], and how they could be made to act more honorably. Though this king was younger than Dalinar had imagined Nohadon to be, and refused the idea of writing a book as absurd, Dalinar was sure that he was right about him being Nohadon. The king mentioned that all of his scribes were killed after [[Yelig-nar\|Yelig-nar]] broke into his chancery. Eventually this man decided to unite the people so that they could stand better against future Desolations.
Dalinar was going to revisit this vision when the Stormfather tells him he can share the visions with anyone. He intentionally revisits to meet with [[Venli\|Venli]] until the vision is destroyed by [[Odium\|Odium]].

### In the Top Room
This is the first vision that Dalinar experienced, but he later has trouble remembering it. He later sees it again after the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]]. In this vision, a man stands beside Dalinar, showing him what might happen in the future, though the man admits that [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] is better at seeing the future than he. Then, finally, Dalinar realized that this voice, this man, has never actually heard him, explaining why he never answered Dalinar's questions. This man told Dalinar that he is the Almighty and that [[Odium\|Odium]] had killed him.

### Taker of Secrets
For the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] known as "Taker of Secrets", see [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]].
After the Battle of the Tower, Dalinar had a vision in which he saw himself as a soldier, marching with several other soldiers through a shallow body of water that he believed to be the [[Purelake\|Purelake]]. They were heading towards a massive fortress, which was not known to exist in the Purelake in modern times, and looking for a spren acting unusual. They mention that [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] made spren act odd. Dalinar saw a spren with red eyes, followed shortly by another, larger spren which animated a massive piece of stone, which ripped itself free of the lakebed to attack them. The soldiers mentioned that the beast was a [[Thunderclast\|Thunderclast]].

### Broken People
Dalinar first had this vision back when he thought the visions were simple nightmares. After sending Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen]] into the starfalls vision, Dalinar returns to this vision. He fights a ragged group of enemy soldiers and after the battle ends he meets a [[Stoneward\|Stoneward]] and sees him use the Surge of [[Cohesion\|Cohesion]] before pulling [[Navani\|Navani]] and [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] into the vision, and the Stormfather confirms that it is a vision of the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]]. Later, on her request, Dalinar sends Queen Fen into this vision alone before she decided whether to visit Urithiru.
