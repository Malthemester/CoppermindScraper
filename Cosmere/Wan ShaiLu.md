## Appearance and Personality

For more images, see [[Wan ShaiLu/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Shai is small of stature like the rest of MaiPon people. She has dark hair that lays straight and long. She wears spectacles because of her bad eyesight.
She loves the thrill, the accomplishment and the wonder of Forgery. However, at times, she is tempted by a simple life where she doesn't have to hide or lie. She constantly quotes her **Uncle Won** and **Aunt Sol** although they don't really exist. They are figments of her imagination created for one of her Essence Marks. She believes her Forgeries are works of art and she gets angry when contradicted on that.
She worships the [[Unknown God\|Unknown God]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Shai is a very talented artist, but generally uses her ability to make forgeries of paintings. She reads people very well and is a master manipulator. She has good control of her emotions. She is very knowledgeable in art history and has a very good understanding of [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]].
Shai is one of the best [[Forgery\|Forgers]] ever to live, especially in Soul Forgery. Flesh Forgery is one of the few branches of Forgery she hasn't studied in depth because getting a Flesh Forgery wrong usually means the subject dying.

### Essence Marks
Shai has five [[Essence Mark\|Essence Marks]] which took her over eight years to create.

## History
Shai first started inquiring about being a Forger when she was eight years old.
[[Han ShuXen\|Han ShuXen]], an old painter who had tutored Shai as a child, asked her to destroy his masterpiece *Lily of the Spring Pond*. ShuXen hated the Rose Empire and didn't want his painting, which he had painted for a woman he once loved, at their hands. He helped Shai create a counterfeit.
Shai managed to destroy the original painting in the Arbiter [[Frava\|Frava's]] office near the [[Imperial Gallery\|Imperial Gallery]], replaced it with a fake and planted another lower-quality counterfeit in her room in order to hide to theft. With the help of the [[Imperial Fool\|Imperial Fool]], she also broke into the [[Rose Palace\|Rose Palace's]] Imperial Gallery by impersonating a noblewoman to steal the [[Moon Scepter\|Moon Scepter]]. However The Fool betrayed her. He stole Shai's copy of the Moon Scepter, swapped it for the original, then escaped after giving Shai up to the palace guards. Shai was captured and charged with public execution for theft.

### The Emperor's Soul
A day before her execution, she is asked by the council of five arbiters to Forge a soul in exchange for her freedom. Shai doesn't think it is possible to create a soulstamp for an entire person's soul in the hundred days they give her at first, but accepts their offer in the hope that it will give her time to escape. She is taken before the Emperor [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]] and told that he took a crossbow bolt in the head from the assassins sent by the [[Glory Faction\|Glory Faction]] and despite surgeons [[Resealing\|resealing]] the wound, he is in a vegetative state. She is told to replace the emperor's soul with a [[Forgery\|Forgery]].
She is given a room barely better than a cell which, over time, she transforms into the finest room in the whole palace with Forgery. She receives her Forgery tools except for her Essence Marks. [[Gaotona\|Gaotona]] volunteers to being her test subject for the soulstamps she creates for Emperor Ashravan. The arbiters hire a [[Bloodsealer\|Bloodsealer]] to make sure of her cooperation. As they work together, Gaotona and Shai grow fond of each other and eventually become friends. Shai starts to collect information on Ashravan's personality and memory to use for the soulstamp.
Shai concluded that the arbiters were planning to kill her, even if she fulfills their agreement, a little while before the soulstamp is done and have another Forger finish her work. She started lacing her notes with subtext about the arduousness of the task to deter the other Forger. All the arbiters except Gaotona proposed that she create a backdoor to the emperor's soul that would allow him to be controlled by the arbiters. Shai played along but eventually refrained from doing it, even for herself.
As her hundred days pass, Shai was constantly tempted to escape but was driven by the challenge of the task. On day ninety-seven, just before she finishes the soulstamp, she enacts her plan to get past the Bloodsealer. The next day, Captain [[Zu (Sel)\|Zu]] tries to kill her, a move she had expected from some of the guards and managed to evade by Forging traps into her room. She escaped and made her way to Ashravan's chambers, desperate to see if she had managed to Forge a soul from nothing. When it succeeds, Gaotona gave her back her Essence Marks and she used them to escape the palace. It later turns out that she didn't reForge Ashravan's soul exactly the way it was and made small changes, nudging him on the path to being a better ruler.
After she escapes, Shai plans to track down the Imperial Fool who betrayed her, a task she eventually succeeds at.

## Trivia
In one of *The Emperor's Soul* deleted scenes, [[Hoid\|Hoid]] visits her in prison and discusses the [[Moon Scepter\|thing]] she stole and how he stole it first.
She will probably have a role, or at least a cameo, in future *Elantris* books.
If she had joined the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], she would most likely have been in the [[Order of Edgedancers\|Order of Edgedancers]].
