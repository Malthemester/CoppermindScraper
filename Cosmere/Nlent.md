**Nlent** is a squat [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] guard on [[Vstim\|Vstim's]] caravan. He and [[Kylrm\|Kylrm]] accompany [[Rysn\|Rysn]] when she goes onto [[Relu-na\|Relu-na]] to trade. When they come across [[Axies\|Axies]] on the way up, Nlent warns Rysn to stay away from him, showing some knowledge of the abilities of [[Aimian\|Aimians]], though it is tainted by superstition. He carries a charm of courage on his wrist: a small item that has no magical properties but serves as a reminder to the wearer to show courage and passion.
