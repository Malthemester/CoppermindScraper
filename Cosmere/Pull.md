## Appearance and Personality
Pull wears a black suit with a bulletproof metal breastplate underneath. He carries at least one handgun. He does not speak much, if at all.

## Attributes and Abilities
Pull is an [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]], an [[Iron\|iron]] [[Misting\|Misting]] also known as a [[Lurcher\|Lurcher]]. He is skilled with Ironpulls, and is able to Pull bullets in flight towards his protective breastplate to avoid injury. He can also quickly scale the exterior of large buildings by Pulling himself upward in a reverse-rappelling motion.

## History
He was employed by the criminal organization known as the [[Set\|Set]], and was partnered with a [[Coinshot\|Coinshot]] nicknamed [[Push\|Push]]. The pair dressed similarly and worked together during heists and other jobs.
In 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the Set hired the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] to perform robberies and kidnappings, and [[Mister Suit\|Mister Suit]] assigned Push and Pull to support [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] in these efforts. They acted as bodyguards for Suit, and were also present to defend against potential interference by [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]].
Wax indeed stowed away on the [[Breaknaught\|Breaknaught]] knowing that the Vanishers would steal it. Miles anticipated this and warned Push and Pull that Wax was likely present before the train car was opened in the Vanishers workshop. However, Wax created a diversion with dynamite, evading an ambush. Push and Pull pursued him up the [[Ironspine Building\|Ironspine Building]]. Wax fired a number of shots at Pull, but he protected himself using his Allomantic abilities. As Pull followed Wax down the building, he was shot with an [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] rifle round by [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and landed face-first on the ground. Push confirmed to Miles that Pull had been killed, and angrily pursued Marasi seeking vengeance.
