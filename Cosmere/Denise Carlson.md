4 Notes


## Appearance and Personality
She is thin and has short, dark, curly hair. [[Jason Write\|Jason Write]] describes her look as extremely innocent and "passably attractive". She is straightforward and calculating.

## Attributes and Abilities
Although she held a relatively low-level position in the Phone Company's facility, Denise was presumably intelligent and had some knowledge of the PC's research and operations.
She had shown some [[Cytonics\|cytonic]] ability and was in the middle of her training. She had met Jason Write on several occasions.

## History
### Disappearance
While living and working on the Phone Company's distant Outer Platform known as Evensong, Denise disappeared under unknown circumstances. The Phone Company's Central Operations on [[Earth (Skyward)\|Earth]] downplayed the incident; the [[United Intelligence Bureau\|United Intelligence Bureau]] assumed it was a simple mugging. However, the PC was actually quite concerned about the disappearance and sent [[Jason Write\|Jason Write]] to investigate. Evensong was several months away from Earth, and by the time Jason arrived, Denise had been found. However, she seemed to have suffered amnesia as well as the loss of her motor skills and had been admitted to a mental hospital.

### Death and Replacement
Jason, who had met Denise several times in the past, immediately noticed several strange things about her. She did not exhibit the usual symptoms of someone with amnesia, and could not remember anything at all. Her speaking ability returned very rapidly, but her physical issues defied explanation. Jason was confused by Denise's unfamiliarity with simple human concepts like anger and the taste of salt. After further investigation, he realized that she had an affinity for bright red lights and used unusual hand gestures, both characteristics of a cytonically advanced alien race known as the [[Varvax\|Varvax]].
Jason connected Denise's disappearance to the supposed murder of a Varvax ambassador named [[Vahnn\|Vahnn]] and realized that their minds had been switched using cytonics. Vahnn was a Varvax dissident and had taken over Denise's body hoping to learn more about human weapons of war, which were far superior to those of other alien races. Vahnn (in Denise's body) was taken to PC headquarters on Earth. Denise's consciousness was presumably destroyed when Vahnn's original body was incinerated after the swap.
