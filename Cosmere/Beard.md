## Appearance and Personality
Beard's nickname is strange because he doesn't actually have any type of beard, although he has hairy hands. He is short, stocky, and [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]].
Beard is very talkative and tells outrageous stories, most of them claiming that he performed some heroic action or met with royalty. He claims to have learned to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] from the King of [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]], performed secret missions for [[Amaram\|Amaram]], learned to cook flatbread in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], and received a knife as a personal gift from the [[Blackthorn\|Blackthorn]]. His friends mostly ignore him and often have to tell him to be quiet, or he will always be launching into another story. He is aware that he annoys people, but it does not seem to bother him. Beard's fellow squad members mostly feign annoyance at his stories, and actually seem to get along with him well; he appears to be a competent soldier. He is briefly dejected when he learns that [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] actually knows [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] since it undermines his claim that he once swam in the [[Purelake\|Purelake]] with the Blackthorn, but he quickly changes the story to include the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] instead. His storytelling and his tendency to address Kaladin by an obscure slang nickname ("Kip") reminds Kaladin of [[Lopen\|Lopen]].

>‚Äú*When in the service of the merchant lords of Steen, I once had to swim across an entire vat of dye in order to save the prince‚Äôs daughter. When I was done, I still wasn‚Äôt as colorful as that preening cremling.*‚Äù
\-Beard, upon seeing a disguised Adolin[2]

Beard is of the tenth [[Dahn\|dahn]], the lowest rank of [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]. He views 'middlers', lighteyes who are above the eighth dahn, but not quite highlords, as useless. During a patrol, he insults [[Adolin\|Adolin]], who was disguised as a middler, mocking the extraordinary amount of colorful clothing that Adolin was wearing. He also blames [[Kholinar\|Kholinar's]] slow disintegration on Queen [[Aesudan\|Aesudan's]] execution of [[Pai\|Pai]].
Beard initially seems to be an atheist, declining to wear a [[Glyphward\|glyphward]] in battle and saying that he "knows a lot about telling which stories have been made up" and that nobody is watching over him. Seeing Kaladin kill a [[Fused\|Fused]] seems to restore his faith, and Beard wears the [[Glyphward\|glyphward]] 'Fortune' on his arm during the final stand of the Wall Guard.

## Attributes and Abilities
Beard is a professional soldier who is trained in the use of a pike and a tower shield. He is familiar with the defensive formations needed to defend the walls of Kholinar.

## History
After [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] joined Noro's squad, Beard assumed he was a fellow low-ranking lighteyed soldier. Beard easily befriended Kaladin and helped him to become familiar with the [[Kholinar Wall Guard\|Kholinar Wall Guard's]] system. He appreciated that Kaladin was able to see the best in people. He displayed strong loyalty to his post and to Highmarshal [[Azure\|Azure]], guarding the secrets of her gender and her [[Soulcast\|Soulcasting]] operation.
Beard was present when Azure inspected the Wall Guard's barrack. He also saw Kaladin killed a [[Fused\|Fused]] on [[Kholinar\|Kholinar's]] walls, and, unlike the other members of the squad, just grinned when Kaladin revealed himself to be a [[Surgebinder\|surgebinder]] who carried a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. At Kaladin's request, Beard and the rest of Noro's squad were present when [[Azure\|Azure]] revealed how [[Ithi\|Ithi]] and her sister were supplying the army with food through their [[Soulcast\|Soulcasting]] operation hidden in an [[Aluminum\|aluminum]]-lined chamber in one of the city's [[Windblades\|windblades]].
Beard was part of Kaladin's guard of about fifty soldiers when they entered [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]] to confront [[Aesudan\|Aesudan]] and find [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]]. Beard took part in the chaotic fighting that ensued, and was rammed through with a spear by [[Sah\|Sah]]. Beard was quickly avenged by [[Noro\|Noro]] before he, too, was killed. Kaladin later regretfully thought about Beard when he saw [[Lopen\|Lopen]] telling stories.
