\-Kalak[2]


Thunderclasts are enormous stone beasts, easily five or six times larger than a person, with their hands alone being six feet long. They take a skeletal, humanoid form, with long limbs that end with spiky, clawed fingers. On their chests, they have rib-like protrusions, and there are ridges running along their backs. Their heads are narrow and arrow-like, with glowing red eyes.
The thunderclast proper, however, is a [[Singer\|singer]] soul. The potential thunderclasts are far more powerful than their [[Fused\|Fused]] kinsmen, and much more twisted, to the point where they barely resemble their species. When they desire to take on a physical form, they sink into the stone and animate it, ripping themselves out in the humanoid form. As such, they retain some qualities of the material they take on, like the color or a covering of moss or fungus.
It's possible that there are other types of [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] entities that can create thunderclasts, as a [[Spren\|spren]] is also seen at one point plunging into the ground right before a thunderclast rips itself out.

Despite their enormous size, thunderclasts have no problems staying upright, and can swing their body around with incredible force, easily toppling regular fortifications. Though brute force is their greatest strength, they're also capable of precise actions such as throwing boulders, or carrying regular [[Fused\|Fused]] in their hands without crushing them.
Although warped and twisted, thunderclasts seem to retain some level of personality, enough so to answer to names and have a concrete sense of their gender. While they can obey commands, however, they do not seem capable of communicating themselves. They are capable of making earth-shaking roars and trumpeting sounds to express their emotions, though.
Despite being made of the same material as their targets, they do not crack, and it seems they cannot be destroyed by ordinary means, although hammers are given as a viable option for combating them. Another viable way to deal with them is to cut them up with [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] to the point where they're no longer mobile, although this carries significant risk to both people and their surroundings. Indeed, [[Adolin\|Adolin]] theorizes that killing thunderclasts was in fact the original purpose of Shardblades, an idea mirrored by Szeth's thoughts on them. [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] can kill them for good.

## History
While it's unknown for how long they've been in [[Odium\|Odium's]] service, thunderclasts date back to the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] of old, even back to [[Nohadon\|Nohadon's]] times. People back then knew to look out for them, and sent out hunting parties, although only [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] were capable of fighting them. They were powerful enough to pose dangers even to the [[Herald\|Heralds]], with [[Kelek\|Kelek]] in particular dying to them several times. After the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], however, thunderclasts passed on into myths. By the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], there were numerous stories about [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] with bodies of stone, likely as a cultural memory of the thunderclasts.
Thunderclasts appeared a few times in [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]]. When he met [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]], he saw numerous corpses of them littering the battlefield and, in a separate vision in which he participated in a hunt for a corrupted spren on the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], he witnessed one rip itself out of the ground. However, they didn't make their proper debut in the modern era until the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], when at least one thunderclast participated in the main attack, easily breaking down the city wall and decimating numerous buildings in its wake.
In the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Odium called two singer souls -- [[Kai-garnis\|Kai-garnis]] and [[Yushah\|Yushah]] -- to create thunderclasts. After Yushah broke through the wall, he sent her after the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve\|Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]] while Kai-garnis went to assist the [[Fused\|Fused]] in taking the [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. Both were eventually defeated; Yushah was destroyed permanently by [[Szeth\|Szeth]] with [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], while Kai-garnis was immobilized by [[Renarin\|Renarin]] and fled her stone body.
