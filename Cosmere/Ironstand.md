**Ironstand** is a town in [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] on the train line between [[Elendel\|Elendel]] and [[New Seran\|New Seran]].

## History
[[Wax\|Wax]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]], [[Steris\|Steris]], [[Marasi\|Marasi]], and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] are on the way to New Seran when their train is attacked. Just before Ironstand, the [[Nightstreet Gang\|Nightstreet Gang]] boards and makes an attempt to rob the train and its passengers.
The Nightstreet Gang had been sent by [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores]] on behalf of the [[Set\|Set]] to attack Wax and distract him from his investigation of [[Telsin Ladrian\| Telsin's]] whereabouts. Following the attack, the train stops in Ironstand. The town doctor tends Wax's wounds, and the Ironstand constables take custody of the captured bandits. Wax notes that the doctor probably spends most of her time on cows and most of the constables' cases are small, implying that Ironstand is a small rural town.
The Nightstreet Gang is well known in Ironstand and the surrounding area, despite not being well known elsewhere.
