>“*Our own natures destroy us. Alakavish was a Surgebinder. He should have known better. And yet, the Nahel bond gave him no more wisdom than a regular man.*”
\-Nohadon on Alakavish and the Nahel bond[1]


**Alakavish** was a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] during the time of [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He did not bond an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]].
He somehow brought the world to war prior to a [[Desolation\|Desolation]]. His powers held a large allure to the common people. Eleven years into the Desolation, some wished to blame Alakavish, thinking that if he hadn't caused a war, the Desolation would not have caused so much damage. Nohadon, however, thought Alakavish was a symptom of a greater disease: that humanity would be torn by war and squabbling, and perhaps deserved to lose against the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]].
