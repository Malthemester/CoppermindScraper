## Time & Location
The Middlefest Fair takes place at the same time each year, during [[Midpeace\|Midpeace]]. Midpeace is the period opposite the [[Weeping\|Weeping]] in the Rosharan year. There are no [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] during Midpeace, but it does not have the incessant rain of the Weeping. This gap in the storms allows for the longer festival. It also seems likely that the Middlefest fair gets its name from Midpeace.
The Middlefest Fair is celebrated in the kingdoms of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], but it is uncertain which others participate. In rural regions of the kingdoms, there are traditional fairgrounds on the highlords' lands where the festivities are set up each year. Local lords of at least the fourth [[Dahn\|dahn]] and their vassal houses attend the fairs, along with their households.

## Events
The Middlefest Fair is the highlight of the year for many darkeyes and lighteyes alike. Among the most popular events are the duels. Fought by lighteyes of low dahn, the duels are one of the few ways that lesser landless lighteyes can gain notoriety in their area. Higher-ranking lighteyes get boxes to view the fights, and even occasionally participate themselves.
There are also simple games of guessing and chance. Occasionally a [[Worldsinger\|Worldsinger]] will attend to provide tales of far-off lands and peoples. The darkeyes bring drums and sing songs together. Eating, drinking and gambling are also common activities. People play card games and bet on [[Axehound\|axehound]] fights. Children are often given sweets.
The fair is also an opportunity for merchants, including highly ranked darkeyes, to sell their wares. Exotic goods and creatures are bought and sold, such as "[[Chicken\|chickens]]" from exotic [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. Lighteyes also use the event to make various trade agreements and maneuver for influence among one another and with the local [[Highprince\|highprince]].

## Notable Middlefests
In [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar's]] youth, she attends a Middlefest Fair on her family's lands. Her father was forced to agree to a disadvantageous trade agreement with Brightlord [[Revilar\|Revilar]], who has the favor of Highprince [[Valam\|Valam]]. Shallan attempted to bring happiness to her family by helping repair the damage their father did to [[Balat\|Balat]], [[Jushu\|Jushu]], and [[Wikim\|Wikim]]. She also met [[Hoid\|Hoid]], who tested Shallan's Lightweaving abilities, delivered a message from [[Helaran\|Helaran]], and encouraged her to remain strong.

## Trivia
When [[Kaladin Stormblessed\|Kaladin Stormblessed]] tears up [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv's]] map en route to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], he spitefully wishes the [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] a happy Middlefest.
[[House Davar\|House Davar]] uses canvas draped between [[Jella\|jella]] trees to create canopies that are used as pavilions.
