**Drama** is a cadet in either [[Inkwell Flight\|Inkwell Flight]] or [[Firestorm Flight\|Firestorm Flight]] in the [[DDF\|DDF]]. She is likely from [[Bountiful Cavern\|Bountiful Caverns]]. It is unclear whether Drama is a callsign or this cadet's name.
There are only four people in her Flight in the time period just before graduation. She is used to a large amount of conversation occurring over her communication line during flights and may herself be a chatty person. She has a good-natured relationship with the three members remaining in her Flight before graduation.
Drama has dinner with with [[FM\|FM]], [[Spensa\|Spensa]], and the members of Inkwell and Firestorm Flight shortly after [[Arturo\|Arturo]] is pulled from [[Flight School\|Flight School]]. She claims to know [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]], however, believes he would not interact with the other members of his Flight unless giving orders or criticizing them. It is unclear whether she has developed this opinion based on generalization's of the Skyward flightleader or because of previous interactions with him.
She is unable to pronounce Arturo's callsign and is familiar with his outgoing personality. She characterizes [[Spensa\|Spensa]] as being a quiet person and believes, to some extent, that FM is similar, as she assumes that with Arturo's departure, [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] would not communicate much outside of necessary commands.
