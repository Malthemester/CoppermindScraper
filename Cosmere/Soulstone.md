## Appearance and Properties
Soulstone is a fine grained rock, similar in appearance to soapstone. It is white with blood red flecks mixed in.
In its natural state, soulstone is almost as soft as chalk, yet it does not chip when scraped. When a piece of soulstone is held in a fire, it becomes extremely hard, like quartz. Once hardened, it has a gray and red marbled appearance.

## Usage in Forgery
A soulstamp can be made from many types of material, but soulstone is the preferred medium for Forgers. Precision in soulstamps is crucial—taking off too much or too little by mistake is devastating—but soulstone effectively negates this problem. Because it is soft and does not chip, it can be carved very precisely. Additionally, the fact that soulstone can be hardened under flame significantly increases the durability of the stamp. These properties make the stone invaluable to a Forger, especially for soulstamps that they will reuse often or particularly complex stamps such as [[Essence Mark\|Essence Marks]]. The only way to create a better stamp is to use crystal, but it is exceptionally difficult to carve.

## History
[[Wan ShaiLu\|Wan ShaiLu]] first learned to carve soulstone during her apprenticeship as a Forger. She was not allowed to touch soulstone in the early part of her training.
During Shai's imprisonment in the [[Rose Palace\|Rose Palace]], she requested a large quantity of soulstone to use in the creation of [[Ashravan\|Ashravan's]] Essence Mark. Although [[Frava\|Frava]] was hesitant to provide her with such a powerful material, she relented since Shai would not have been able to succeed without it in the required timeframe. Shai was happy with the quality and quantity of the soulstone that she was given. After successfully creating Ashravan's Essence Mark, she took some extra soulstone with her when she escaped the palace.
