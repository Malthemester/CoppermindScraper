The **artisan's script** is a form of writing in the nation of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. Unlike most writing systems, which are based on form and shape, the artisan's script is based on color. Each color represents a different sound in Hallandren's language. In its most basic form, simple dots are used. More advanced writers use lines that gradually shift in color, or glyphs that form pictures.
To use the artisan's script to its full potential requires perfect color recognition granted by the [[Heightening\|Third Heightening]].
The [[God King\|God Kings]] of Hallandren are taught to communicate with the artisan's script due to the removal of their tongues.
