The **First Gem** is a topaz with magical properties that [[Hoid\|Hoid]] once carried and from which he took his name for a while.
The name First Gem was referenced by [[Patji (being)\|Patji]] in the Second Oathbringer Letter, when he addressed Hoid as "Cephandrius, bearer of the First Gem.". The fact that Hoid was a Dawnshard at some point is related to his title as Bearer of the First Gem.

## Theories
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

This page or section contains details from the unpublished work *Dragonsteel Prime*!This information has the potential to ruin plot elements of both published works and upcoming book releases for the reader. It should also be considered uncanonical and could completely change in the future.

A character named "Topaz" appears in the unpublished work [[Dragonsteel Prime\|Dragonsteel Prime]]. Although *Dragonsteel* Prime is not canonical, Brandon has confirmed that some individuals in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] still know Hoid by that name.
Hoid told [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] that he was once named for a beautiful rock that became "completely worthless" for his wearing it. If this is a reference to the First Gem, it likely indicates that it no longer holds its original magical properties. [[Frost\|Frost]] also mentions a gemstone being "dead" in his letter to Hoid.
Although topaz is a [[Polestone\|polestone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], Frost and Patji's knowledge of the gem, its name, and Hoid's status as one of the oldest beings in the cosmere all hint that the First Gem has importance beyond Roshar.
