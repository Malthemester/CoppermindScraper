**Patji's Eye** is an emerald lake on the island of [[Patji (island)\|Patji]].
It is the home to the symbiotic worm which gives the [[Aviar\|Aviar]] their cognitive talents. Aviar come to Patji's Eye when they are young to gain their talent. The worms feed off of the fruits of [[Patji's Finger\|Patji's Finger]], which only grow on Patji, and the Aviar gain the symbiont by eating the worms. The lake conceals the minds of those in its vicinity, allowing them to hide from predators who hunt by seeking out consciousness.
The trappers know about Patji's Eye and what the Aviar do there, but they do not go there often.
It is a natural manifestation of Investiture and is much smaller than most others found in the cosmere. It serves as a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] in the [[Drominad System\|Drominad System]].
[[Khriss\|Khriss]] notes it to be very dangerous, saying that all expeditions to the perpendicularity by [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] scholars have not returned. It is unknown whether this is just due to Patji's natural hazards or something less natural.
