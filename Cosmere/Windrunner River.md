The **Windrunner River** is a body of water running through [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is named for the [[Order of Windrunners\|Order of Windrunners]] of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].

## Geography
The Windrunner River is the longest and most prominent river in northern Alethkar, and it defines the borders of several princedoms. Its catchment area spans most of northern Alethkar; the main branch of the river originates from the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]] near [[Shulin\|Shulin]] and flows northwest until it empties into the [[Bay of Elibath\|Bay of Elibath]]. One of its major tributaries flows from the [[Sunmaker Mountains\|Sunmaker Mountains]] and includes several branches that are close to [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. Other tributaries originate near [[Kelathar\|Kelathar]] and [[Tomat\|Tomat]]. The village of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] also lies on the river's path.
In [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], the river is represented by long, thin peninsulas in the [[Sea of Oracles\|Sea of Oracles]], one of which contains [[Candlemore\|Candlemore]].

## History
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] flew from [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to the besieged city of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] with [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] and his strike team, [[Sylphrena\|Sylphrena]] informed him that they had passed the Windrunner River to help orient him to their location on the continent. When Kaladin and Elhokar were later walking towards the city, they passed over the river on a stone bridge, and Elhokar noted that the river was named after Kaladin's prominent Radiant Order.
After the attempt to free Kholinar failed and most of the team ended up in Shadesmar, they traveled along the narrow strips of land that represented the river in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
