**William Montane** is the late husband of [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]], and father of [[William Ann Montane\|William Ann Montane]].
Little is known about William Montane. It seems likely that he works at [[Silence's waystop\|Silence's waystop]] when it is run by [[Silence's grandmother\|Silence's grandmother]]. Silence becomes pregnant by William shortly before his death, although it is uncertain how he died. It also appears that he and Silence are never married legally, although she takes his surname. Silence's grandmother considers him to be a fool and an idiot for believing that the [[Shade\|shades]] and the [[Evil\|Evil]] are punishments from the [[God Beyond\|God Beyond]]. When Silence gives birth to her daughter, she names the girl William Ann, after her father. William Ann takes after her father in appearance.
After William's death, his shade is said to guard Silence's waystop against enemies, although it is possible that this legend was started by Silence herself.
