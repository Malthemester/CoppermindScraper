**Mistwraiths** were a species of creatures on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
They were created by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] from the [[Terris\|Terris]] [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] after he took the power at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. It is unclear if Mistwraiths survived the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].

## Physiology
Like kandra, they appear to be amorphous blobs capable of absorbing bones and tissue of other creatures to gain shape. However, unlike kandra, since they do not possess sentience, their shapes are random and mix many different species into one. They are usually humongous and are fearful existences in [[Skaa\|skaa]] folklore, associated with skaa's fear toward mists. But contradictory to their unnerving appearance, they are actually quite harmless and only eat dead bodies. 
Mistwraiths are people who have a blockage between the Physical Realm and the Cognitive Realm, which impairs their ability to think. Mistwraiths have a lifespan of roughly fifty years, and are able to breed.
A single [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike is enough to staple a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] to a mistwraith, though whether this has happened in the past is unknown.

## Relation with Kandra
Through the use of [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] they could regain the sentience they once possessed, becoming [[Kandra\|kandra]] after being implanted with two Hemalurgic spikes. [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] mentions that removing both spikes brings the kandra back to their "primal state," once again becoming a mistwraith.. The transformation from mistwraith back to kandra is quick, as evidenced when [[Wayne\|Wayne]] replaces MeLaan's spikes after she experiences this firsthand, although this could depend on how much time passes between each state.
The transition from mistwraith to kandra requires specific types of Hemalurgic spikes, known as [[Blessing\|blessings]]. Other types of Hemalurgic spikes, such as those that create [[Koloss\|koloss]], would not necessarily be enough to transform the mistwraith into a kandra, however they would cause weird side effects.
