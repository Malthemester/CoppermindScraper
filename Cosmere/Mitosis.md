## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[Mitosis/Summary\|Mitosis/Summary]].
The title of the novellete, *Mitosis*, refers to an Epic who attempts to retake control of Newcago after the Reckoners have defeated Steelheart. Mitosis's super power is the ability to split himself into multiple beings. However, the more he splits himself, the less solid his individual parts become. They can only transfer memories by physical touch, and as the molecules grow more distant and less well bonded, the beings begin to fall apart.
A big theme in this story is that ordinary people can be heroes simply by being ordinary. The people of Newcago still live in constant fear of the Epics, even after the defeat of Steelheart, and the Reckoners make a concerted effort to help the people overcome these fears and live normal lives.
David Charleston, the protagonist of the *Reckoners* books, discovers a critical clue as to the weaknesses of epics in this story when he finds out that Mitosis's weakness is listening to rock music that he (Mitosis) had played in a band years before he ever became an [[Epic\|Epic]]. He doesn't know the entire significance of this clue at the time, but it later proves to be a critical piece of information for the Reckoners as he realizes that weaknesses may be tied to the epic's past.
