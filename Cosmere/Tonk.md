## Appearance
Tonks are quadrupedal. Their heads and the front halves of their bodies are similar in size and shape to a mule, while their hindquarters more closely resemble those of a kangaroo. Their bodies are covered in gray carapace, which is segmented and particularly thick along the top of the body. They have long, thick tails, prominent horns coming out of their heads at various angles, and clawed feet that appear to have opposable thumbs.

## Usage
>“*Riding tonks have very weak minds. Whenever they get confused they assume it's a sandstorm and bury themselves beneath the ground.*”
\-Kenton, to Khrissalla[2]

Tonks are domesticated, and they are often used for transportation in the deserts of [[Dayside\|Dayside]]. They are weak-minded and easy to lead. When used for riding, they are fitted with a saddle, bridle, and saddlebags. When they are scared or confused, they tend to bury themselves in the sand, although skilled riders such as [[Aarik\|Aarik]] may be able to prevent this. Tonks are present in hunting camps in the [[Deep sand\|deep sand]], although [[Terha\|terha]] are preferred for hunts.
They are sometimes used by [[Darkside\|Darksiders]] that are visiting Dayside, but this may be rare, as Khrissalla and her team do not appear to be very familiar with their behavior.

## Taxonomy
Tonks have superficial similarities to both terha and some species of [[Sandling\|sandlings]], with both having horn, water-soluble carapace, and a propensity to bury themselves in sand. It is unknown if there is a relation, natural or bred, between the creatures.

## Trivia
The name "tonk" is not related to the character [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]].
