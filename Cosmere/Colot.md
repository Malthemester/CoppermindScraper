## History
### Kholin army
Colot was an archer in the Kholin army in a battalion with a number of archers; he was a captain, also commanding some scouts, scribes, and bridgemen.
He was good friends with Captain [[Tallan\|Tallan]] of the Eighth Company, which acted as the Fifth Battalion's policing force during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. After the battle, he volunteered his battalion to help [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] scout [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. He arrived on the scene with reinforcements just after the death of [[Vedekar Perel\|Vedekar Perel]]; [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] asked him to help secure the perimeter and to notify [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] and [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]] of the death.

### Radiant squire
Colot was among a group of potential [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] squires that [[General Khal\|General Khal]] sent to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. Kaladin was hesitant to recruit lighteyes, but [[Skar\|Skar]] vouched for Colot and pointed out that [[Renarin\|Renarin]] was also lighteyed. Colot and the other lighteyed recruits submitted to orders during the tryout without complaint, causing Skar to reflect on Kaladin's and [[Teft\|Teft's]] prejudiced perception of lighteyes.
[[Rlain\|Rlain]] later saw Colot and nine other new recruits to Bridge Four training with [[Peet\|Peet]] after gaining the ability to breathe in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. Colot was the only lighteyed squire in the group, and remained one of only a few members of Bridge Four who were originally lighteyed.
After becoming a squire, Colot's name was known to [[Shallan\|Shallan]]. While disguised as a messenger from the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], she invoked his name to seem more authentic during her attempt to deliver a letter from Elhokar to [[Aesudan\|Aesudan]].
