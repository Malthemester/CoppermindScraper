**Ars Arcanum** is a glossary or appendix section at the end of the books that are part of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] universe. The information is presented from an in-universe perspective.
Every Ars Arcanum is written by [[Khriss\|Khriss]]. The annotations on many of the images from the various books are made by her assistant [[Nazh\|Nazh]].
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon]] initially planned to use the phrase "Ars Magica" for these glossaries, as he felt it was "a cool Latinate take on 'Magical Arts' or 'Magical Skills'." However, there was a role-playing game with that name, so he instead went with "Ars Arcanum," which he ultimately felt had more of a true-Latinate feel.

## Ars Arcanum in each book or series
*All of the cosmere stories containing an Ars Arcanum are listed here in rough chronological order.*

### Elantris
*Elantris* has an Ars Arcanum that lists selected [[Aon\|Aons]] of note and includes their design, their meanings, and some examples of their use within Aonic names or terms. The tenth anniversary edition added a brief essay titled "On [[AonDor\|AonDor]]". The essay raises questions about the origin of Aons and compares the manifestations of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] found on [[Sel\|Sel]] to those found on other planets. Selish magic is noted to have several unique qualities that Khriss cannot explain. The essay is also notable for mentioning [[Vax\|Vax]].

### Mistborn
The books in the [[Mistborn series\|Mistborn series]] each have an Ars Arcanum with the table of [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]], describing what each of the [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] metals does. Since more metals are discovered and new things about them are learned, the table in each later book has more metals and information with greater accuracy.

### Warbreaker
The Ars Arcanum in *Warbreaker* includes a table showing the abilities granted by the different [[Heightening\|Heightenings]] of [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]].

### The Stormlight Archive
The Ars Arcanum in *The Stormlight Archive* gives detailed information about the [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]], as well as descriptions of the different [[Surge\|Surges]] and how they are used by [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]]. Some information has been added in each book: a Lightweaving section appears in *Words of Radiance* and *Oathbringer* contains an additional section about [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]]. *Rhythm of War* contains an additional section about the [[Surge\|Surge]] of [[Cohesion\|Cohesion]], particularly focusing on its use in shaping stone, and mentioned [[Microkinesis\|microkinesis]].
