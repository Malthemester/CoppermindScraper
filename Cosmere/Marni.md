**Marni** is an employee at [[Jez's Duty\|Jez's Duty]] in the [[Ten Rings\|Ten Rings]] section of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on Roshar.
Marni presumably has some sort of supervisory role at the winehouse, as [[Adolin\|Adolin]] thinks he needs to talk to Marni about the unflattering work uniforms worn by [[Hem\|Hem]] and the other barmaids.
