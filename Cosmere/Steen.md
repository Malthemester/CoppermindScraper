**Steen** is a kingdom at the tip of a peninsula in southwestern [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. As such, it only borders [[Liafor\|Liafor]].
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, it was part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. [[Noura\|Noura]] describes them as a tricky bunch, and hints that they shouldn't be invited to the [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] talks along with the other [[Makabak\|Makabak]] representatives.
[[Beard\|Beard]] tells a tale about him swimming across a vat of dyes when in service to the Steen merchant lords. The crew of *First Dreams* on its trip to [[Akinah\|Akinah]] is made up of Steen mercenaries.
Just before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], a report from  relayed to a meeting in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] confirms that the early [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] reported by [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] has passed and also mentions that it is faster and more violent than previous storms. This comes just before the other revelations about the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]] and the first [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]].
Prior to the voyage of the *Wandersail* to [[Aimia\|Aimia]], [[Lopen\|Lopen]] indicates that men from Steen were present in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Specifically, he noted that their beards were wrapped in cords - a fashion that has been shown elsewhere in Roshar and the cosmere.. Later, [[Nikli\|Nikli]] comments that 'ordinary people' in Aimia (i.e. not the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]]) wore their beards in the peculiar cord-like style of Steen.
