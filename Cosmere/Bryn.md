## Appearance and Personality
Bryn has short hair and brown skin.

## History
Bryn joined [[Arturo Mendez\|Arturo]], [[Nedd Strong\|Nedd]], [[Kimmalyn\|Kimmalyn]], [[FM\|FM]], and [[Spensa\|Spensa]], at an [[Alta Base\|Alta Base]] restaurant after the [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] pilots had been ordered to take leave following the death of [[Hurl\|Hurl]]. A few days before Arturo left for [[ReDawn (planet)\|ReDawn]] with [[Alanik\|Alanik]] and the rest of Skyward Flight, Bryn sent him a letter and broke up with him. Arturo suspects that she wanted to break up before, but wasn't sure how to. Bryn told Arturo that he had changed a lot in flight school, and he didn't care about the same things anymore. Arturo's decision to stay with the DDF instead of coming home put the strain of distance on their relationship. Arturo agrees that they are better off apart, and doesn't have hard feelings.
