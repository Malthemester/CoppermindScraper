## Geography
Tukar lies in south-western Roshar, on the coast of the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] and the [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]], in the geographical region of [[Makabak\|Makabak]]. It borders [[Emul\|Emul]] to the north and [[Marat\|Marat]] to the west, both on rivers. The island chain leading from Tukar to Aimia are possibly under Tukari control. The general climate of the country is unknown. It's likely to be hot and dry, much like the rest of Makabak.
Tukar has several settlements, such as [[Torriqqam\|Torriqqam]] and [[Khathazan\|Khathazan]]. Along the Southern Depths, there are also the towns of [[Riqu Mar\|Riqu Mar]] and [[Linder Mar\|Linder Mar]]. [[Icewater\|Icewater]], located on one of the islands off the coast, may belong to it. [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]], the capital of Emul, is located on the western border of Tukar, and the Tukari have laid claim to it for generations.

## History
>‚Äú*The war between Emul and Tukar was heating up. Granted, everyone was always saying that. But things had changed over the last few years.*‚Äù
\-Hauka[6]


During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Tukar was part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. At some point, Makabakam splintered into smaller states, with Tukar being one of them. When the [[Azir\|Azish Empire]] began to form, Tukar might've joined them, although their status within the coalition, if it even is part of the coalition, is confusing.
The nations of Tukar and Emul have been in the state of on-and-off conflict for centuries, with the main point of contention being the city of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]]. The latest iteration of this conflict was [[Eighty's War\|Eighty's War]], which at the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] had been going on for six years. The war was likely initiated by the Tukari god-priest, Tezim, who came into power around the same time. Shortly before the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], it started to heat up. Nonetheless, [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] spent some time studying in Tukar before coming to [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]].
When the True Desolation began, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] sent messages to both Emul and Tukar, hoping that at least one of them would join his alliance. Tukar outright refused, with the god-priest demanding that, as an "aspect of the [[Almighty\|Almighty]]", he should be the one in charge of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].
During the Desolation, [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] began appearing in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] in the region equivalent to Tukar. Nonetheless, by the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the country is still considered to be neutral in the conflict.

## Politics and Culture
 by  Dan dos Santos  [[Tezim\|Tezim]], the god-priest of Tukar
The people of Tukar are likely ethnically Makabaki, and thus dark-skinned. Many of them can be found outside their home country, working as mercenaries. Tukar itself has numerous [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]], which it has put to good use in Eighty's War. If they have any [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] or [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], it's never mentioned, though their military is considered highly capable.

### Government and Religion
Tukar is a theocracy, with their current spiritual and political leader, Tezim, being alternately titled the god-priest, god-king and priest-king. Unlike other Makabaki states, which consider [[Herald\|Heralds]] to be gods, the Tukari worship the [[Almighty\|Almighty]], much like the eastern nations. Tezim is likewise revered as a semi-divine figure, and considered an aspect of god. Other titles ascribed to him are "first and last man", "Herald of Heralds" and "bearer of the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]". In reality, Tezim is the half-mad Herald [[Ishar\|Ishar]], making those titles somewhat justified. Though the average Tukari likely don't know his true identity, there are numerous odd rumors swirling about him outside of the country.

### International relations
>‚Äú*I'd rather have the Emuli anyway. Their soldiers might be less capable, but they‚Äôre also‚Ä¶ well, not crazy.*‚Äù
\-Navani[1]


Technically, Tukar appears to be part of the greater [[Azir\|Azish Empire]], and the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] seems to have the capacity to summon the god-priest to [[Azimir\|Azimir]] whenever they wish. However, for generations now Tukar has been at war with [[Emul\|Emul]], another Azish member state, putting the Prime's ability to control it in question. The conflict is centered around the city of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]], considered holy by both the Emuli and the Tukari. While the Emuli consider it their ancestral homeland, the Tukari motivations for the conflict are unknown. In the East, there is some confusion over whether the conflict is purely religious or economical, as Sesemalex Dar is an excellent port.
Tukari in general are considered volatile and crazy by the outsiders, with the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] relieved at not having to ally with them, and [[Szeth\|Szeth]] speculating that they might suddenly abandon their crusade against Emul and go to war with [[Marat\|Marat]]. The main way of communicating with them diplomatically is through their scribes, with the god-priest himself rarely, if ever, speaking in person.
