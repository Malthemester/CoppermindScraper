>‚Äú*That's it, in the Western Dominance, as you guessed. Somewhere near Chardees?*‚Äù
\-Vin discussing the location of the last of the Lord Ruler's storage caches with Elend.[1]


**Chardees** was a city in the [[Western Dominance\|Western Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It was near [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]].
When [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] were in [[Vetitan\|Vetitan's]] storage cache, they found a metal map of the Final Empire that labeled the location every storage cache. The fifth and final one was in the Western Dominance, and Vin initially thought the map indicated the cache was near Chardees, before Elend noted it was actually at Fadrex City.
Vin thinks to herself that she was worse at geography than Elend, so the fact that she thought of Chardees instead of Fadrex may imply that Chardees was once a city of importance in the Western Dominance, before Cett made Fadrex the Dominance's capital city.
