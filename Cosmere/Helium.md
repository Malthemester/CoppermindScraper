**Helium** is an minor [[Epic\|Epic]] with levitation powers. She is employed by [[Loophole\|Loophole]], and makes the room at the top of [[Sharp Tower\|Sharp Tower]] rotate. This creates a revolving restaurant for the Epics to party in. Helium is needed to levitate the floor during construction, so workers (shrunk by Loophole) can get in and install new wires and machinery, since the old ones have turned to salt.
