**Kmakl** is Queen [[Fen\|Fen's]] husband and the prince consort of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
>“*By Kelek, storms, and Passions alike, what is that?*”
\-Kmakl, seeing the red mist of Nergaoul[2]


He is aging, and has drooping mustaches that match his long Thaylen eyebrows. He wears a vest and a cap. He is not a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and does not carry a sword; Dalinar notes that this would be unusual for someone of Kmakl's rank in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. He is often by the queen's side and sometimes acts as an informal advisor, but he does not interfere with her duties as monarch. He is optimistic and courageous.
Like many Thaylens, Kmakl seems to have an affinity for both [[Vorin\|Vorinism]] and the [[Passions\|Passions]]. He is described as "a navy man," and holds the rank of Admiral in the Thaylen navy.

## History
Kmakl was present when [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] arrived in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to assess the damage from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. Kmakl was attended by several scribes and instructed them to write down important bits of Fen's conversation with Dalinar for the official record.
He and Fen attended a meeting of Dalinar's coalition in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], and Kmakl seemed satisfied with Navani's suggestion that the Thaylens oversee trade and supplies.
As the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] unfolded, Kmakl, Fen, and Navani Kholin surveyed the battlefield from the city walls. Kmakl believed that the coalition might successfully defend the city until a [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]] appeared nearby, shaking the ground and severely damaging the wall. Kmakl suffered a cut to his scalp, but he and Fen were able to escape down a staircase to a guard chamber. However, they were seized by soldiers from [[Sadeas princedom\|House Sadeas]] under the influence of the [[Thrill\|Thrill]]. They were bound and gagged and the soldiers moved to kill Kmakl, since [[Amaram\|Amaram]] would only care about the queens. Kmakl tried to face his death with dignity, but the soldiers continued to manhandle him until Navani was able to incapacitate them with her [[Painrial\|painrial]].
Kmakl and Fen subsequently witnessed [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul's]] appearance on the battlefield, Dalinar summoning [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]], Jasnah [[Soulcast\|Soulcasting]] a new section of one of the city's walls, and his son [[Kdralk\|Kdralk]] attempting to recover a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. Kmakl thought the new wall would hold off [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces until he saw the sheer number of [[Singer\|singers]] that were prepared to attack, driven by the Thrill.
