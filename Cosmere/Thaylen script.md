## Structure
Thaylen script is a type of writing system called an abjad, meaning it has no written vowels, which reflects the Thaylen tendency to smash consonant sounds together in their names and speech. The characters used in Thaylen script strongly resemble the basic form of Vorin [[Glyphs\|glyphs]], though use of bilateral symmetry is neglected. There are thirteen known letters in Thaylen script. As with [[Women's script\|women's script]], Thaylen script is merely transliterated English, with vowel sounds ignored. Writing is usually oriented vertically, though the script is sometimes turned on its side and read left to right. Letters may be distorted slightly to make letters fit together, for aesthetics.

## Trivia
The Thaylen script and the Vorin [[Glyph\|glyphs]] are derived from the same ancient writing system, most likely the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]].
Thaylen script was deciphered from the map of the Southern [[Frostlands\|Frostlands]] by Harakeke of the 17th Shard.
