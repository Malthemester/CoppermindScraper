This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Lemex's nurse** is a [[Terris\|Terriswoman]] [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]] acting as nurse to [[Lemex\|Lemex]] when he is poisoned during the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
When Vivenna came to visit Lemex, his nurse told her that nothing more could be done for him. With the aid of [[Denth\|Denth's]] crew, she disposed of Lemex's body. Denth's crew paid her off while dealing with Lemex's property.

## Trivia
When asked about background worldhoppers, Brandon has frequently referred to a Terriswoman, without revealing any other details about her. After some time, fans narrowed down the possibilities and directly asked if Lemex's nurse was this Terriswoman worldhopper. Brandon has confirmed that she is, although there is nothing in the text of Warbreaker to clue readers into her mysterious identity.
She will show up in future books.
Brandon has implied that she has access to one of the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]].
