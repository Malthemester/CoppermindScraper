### Physical Realm
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], peakspren take forms that appear to be made of stone. They can hide inside real rocks if they wish; when they want to reappear, they emerge as if breaking their form out of the rock.

### Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], peakspren inhabit humanoid bodies formed of stone. The population of peakspren is quite varied as to the type of stone, which seems to include every variety found on Roshar. When they touch or rub parts of their body together, it sounds like stone grating together; they also move heavily, and their voices sound rather like grinding rock. The skin of peakspren is etched with cracks that emanate molten light and sometimes seem to form shapes akin to a [[Glyph\|glyph]] or symbol. Despite the molten quality to the fissures' appearance, their skin is only warm to the touch. Peakspren wear human clothing and tend to be bald, with their heads sporting more cracks than the rest of their bodies.

## Abilities
Peakspren themselves seem to have no special abilities beyond those inherent to all spren living in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]; Unativi in particular defers to Shallan's [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] powers as more suitable than his own abilities to deal with any unexpected danger.

### Nahel bond
When a peakspren [[Nahel bond\|bonds]] with a human, the human becomes a [[Stoneward\|Stoneward]] and gains the ability to manipulate the [[Surges\|Surges]] of [[Cohesion\|Cohesion]] and [[Tension\|Tension]].

## History
The first time members of the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] took note of peakspren during the era of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], a group including [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], their spren, and [[Azure\|Azure]] noticed some while traversing the city of [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] in 1173. As they were seeking passage to either an [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] or a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]], they asked a peakspren who reported that he was headed east towards [[Freelight\|Freelight]] if he would consider taking them aboard his ship. The friendly spren seemed ready enough to do so, but told them to return in a half hour after the ship's inspection had taken place; before they had opportunity, however, [[Syl\|Syl]] arranged for them to be taken on board the *Honor's Path* to avoid a group of pursuing [[Fused\|Fused]].
In the year following this encounter, several [[Stoneward\|Stonewards]], including [[Badali\|Badali]] and [[Zu (Roshar)\|Zu]], moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with their peakspren. Zu and [[Ua'pam\|Ua'pam]] were chosen to go on a diplomatic mission to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]], while the other Stonewards and their squires stayed behind and endured the occupation of the tower by [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] and her forces.
As the diplomatic detail to the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] required a ship to transport them, Ua'pam recruited his cousin [[Unativi\|Unativi]] to take them on his barge. When Adolin saw that a group of other peakspren comprised the crew, he mentioned the peakspren leaving them "stranded" in Celebrant. Ua'pam dismissively told him to forget the Kasiden peakspren. Even Unativi, who had agreed to sail the group of humans, refused to go to Lasting Integrity itself, compromising by taking them straight south to [[Nameless\|Nameless]].

>‚Äú*You have more. Skill I need. Instead you go chasing humans. Losing your mind. Going to fight?*‚Äù
\-Unativi to Ua'pam[10]

The peakspren were entranced by how well Adolin had "trained" [[Maya\|Maya]] and enjoyed visiting with Zu. They welcomed [[Vathah\|Vathah's]] help with odd jobs around the barge during the trip and spent some time using their payment of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to manifest goods from the ocean of beads; this gave rise to an argument between Ua'pam and Unativi when the latter wanted to capitalize on Ua'pam's talent for manifestations and couldn't understand why he felt like he needed to fight in the war. When the party finally landed at Nameless, the crew of peakspren were delighted to have an opportunity to peruse the town when Shallan offered to stay behind on the barge with their possessions.

## Culture
>‚Äú*Kasiden peakspren, from the east? They are fools! Forget them.*‚Äù
\-Ua'pam[1]


Peakspren share some culture, speech patterns, and mannerisms with the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]]. They have different tribes or nations in Shadesmar, such as the Kasiden peakspren that originate in the east. There is a rivalry between these groups just as tends to arise between humans.
Peakspren also differ in personal opinions and attitudes towards issues, rather than being one homogeneous group. For instance, [[Ua'pam\|Ua'pam]] argues in favor of throwing their lot in with the humans to defeat [[Odium\|Odium]], while [[Unativi\|Unativi]] believes that they can ride out the conflict without getting involved.
