**Petrine** is a [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] crewmember of the *Brunstell*.

## Appearance and Personality
Petrine is in her sixties and has wrinkled skin. Because she is [[Malwish\|Malwish]], she wears a mask that obscures her face, and presumably changes her mask on occasion. She is tough and courageous.

## History
Petrine was a crew member of the Malwish airship *Brunstell* captained by [[Jordis\|Jordis]]. She served as the enginemaster of the ship and was the eldest member of the crew. She was on the *Brunstell* during its expedition to the mountains near the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] seeking the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] and the lost temple of the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]]. After the ship crashed in [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]], the crew and their ship were captured by the [[Set\|Set]]. The Set tortured the Malwish for information, killing some of them. Petrine was among the captives that that were eventually taken into the mountains to help search for the temple.
The captives were kept in a tent and were not able to contend with the cold weather in the mountains; Jordis was surprised that Petrine survived so long in the cold, given her age. When the situation became truly desperate, Petrine suggested that the Malwish make one final effort to resist their captors, even if they were killed doing so. However, [[Allik\|Allik]] then arrived to release them, and he helped Petrine and the rest of the crew recover using [[Unsealed metalminds\|medallions]]. [[Steris\|Steris]] had brought guns to arm the Malwish, and Petrine helped distribute them before the group engaged the Set in a gunfight.
