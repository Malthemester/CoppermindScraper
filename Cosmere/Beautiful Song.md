**Beautiful Song** is [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] and [[Tuaka\|Tuaka's]] youngest daughter.
Beautiful Song arrived at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] with her family in 1174 after traveling for months to meet with Lunamor, who sent them a message shortly after his arrival. Beautiful Song's caravan was attacked by [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] and her family defended themselves behind a pile of furniture. During the attack a member of her family shot a Voidbringer with an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrow. They were found by [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] during a patrol and taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
She is shy of Lunamor after so long without seeing him.
