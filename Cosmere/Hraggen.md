**Hraggen** is a nation under the dominion of the Fjordell Empire on the continent of Opelon during the [[Late Era\|Late Era]]. The Hraggish has been under [[Fjorden\|Fjorden's]] control for a long period of time, possibly because they were just to the southeast of Fjorden. Hraggen is a relatively small nation, adjacent to [[Jaador\|Jaador]], [[Hrovell\|Hrovell]], and [[Geant\|Geant]]. Many of their words are in Fjordish, so it's likely that their ethnicity is Fjordell.
One city in Hraggen is [[Gmordsom\|Gmordsom]], perhaps its capital.

## Cuisine
