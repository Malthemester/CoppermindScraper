>“*The effects here are more subtle than they are when mixing Surges on Roshar, but I am convinced that each unique combination also creates something distinctive. Not just two powers, you could say, but two powers … and an effect. This demands further study.*”
\-Khriss.[1]


**Resonances** are additional powers or effects gained by people with access to more than one [[Investiture\|Invested Art]] or [[Surge\|Surge]].

## Mechanics
Resonances arise from the nature of how [[Shard\|Shards]] combine. They are not simply a combination of the two base powers, but rather a separate, more distinctive, effect. The combination of powers can also cause slight variances in how the base powers are manifested, which is why [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] of different orders may manifest their shared [[Surge\|Surges]] slightly differently. The longer a person uses their two powers, the more likely they are to acquire a resonance.
An individual with many powers, such as a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] or Full [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]], may lose this added effect. With so many powers, the individual powers effectively wash out any resonance. It is still possible for such people to have a resonance, but it would be much less pronounced. Temporarily gaining additional powers, such as from the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]], would not deprive someone of a resonance they previously had. Someone with one power who began using the Bands of Mourning might develop a resonance between their original power and the Bands. It is possible for a Surgebinder with multiple [[Honorblade\|Honorblades]]/[[Nahel bond\|Nahel bonds]] to develop a resonance or resonances between the four Surges.

## Known Resonances
### Surgebinding
All orders of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] have access to two Surges, and therefore each order has a resonance of their own. If a Radiant were to gain access to other Surges, either through an [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] or [[Nahel bond\|bonding]] to a different [[Spren\|spren]], resonances can form from Surges that wouldn't normally interact. Known [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] resonances include:

[[Windrunner\|Windrunners']] resonance is an increased number of squires, more than any other order.
[[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweavers']] resonance is increased mnemonic ability. For [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], this manifests as the ability to take a "Memory" of a scene, which she can recall at a later time with perfect accuracy; when she put it to paper as a painting or a sketch the Memory is completely removed from her mind. This is similar to the way an Archivist stores memories in their copperminds. There is a limit to how many Memories she can store at the same time. Memories are tied to [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] [[Connection\|Connection]]. Lightweavers can experience light and color differently and may be able to minutely alter the mood of others. It is also implied that they may be able to create a solid illusion by combining their Illumination surge and their Soulcasting.
### Metallic Arts
[[Twinborn\|Twinborn]], individuals who are both [[Ferring\|Ferrings]] and [[Misting\|Mistings]], also have resonances. [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] will usually not create resonances, but it is possible for it to happen.

## Potential Resonances
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

[[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers']] resonance is unknown, though it does not involve telling guilty and innocent people apart.
[[Edgedancers\|Edgedancers']] resonance may be the ability to communicate especially well, as scholars considered the pre-[[Recreance\|Recreance]] Edgedancers "the most articulate and refined" of the Radiants, and [[Lift\|Lift]] is easily able to speak and understand quite opaque street slang in [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]].
[[Elsecaller\|Elsecallers']] resonance may be an internal GPS, due to Jasnah being able to pinpoint the closest settlement after returning from Shadesmar without any equipment. Elsecaller's ability to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] at a distance is not a resonance, as it is something that Lightweavers could learn as well.
## Trivia
The nature of resonances was partially inspired by the  of waves.
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] ability to create a "steel bubble" to deflect metal moving around him was originally intended to be the result of him being a [[Savant\|savant]] in the resonance between his Allomantic steel and Feruchemical iron. Brandon later indicated that may not still be accurate, as he realized Wax was not manifesting the usual consequences of savantism.
