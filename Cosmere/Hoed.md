The **Hoed** are a group of post-[[Reod\|Reod]] [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] that have accumulated so many injuries that they become effectively comatose from the pain.

## Post-Reod
After the Reod, the Elantrian people stopped healing, so any injuries, however minor, remained indefinitely as painful as the moment they were received. Since the Elantrians were still immortal, some sank beneath the weight of their pain, losing their minds. Many have a phrase or words that they repeat over and over.

### Old Elantris
Before [[Raoden\|Raoden]] helped create [[Elantris (city)\|New Elantris]], the Hoed made up the majority of the immediately visible Elantrians. They, like the rest of Elantris, were dirty and uncaring. For the most part, they were ignored.

### New Elantris
Raoden collected the Hoed together in a building in New Elantris, which they called the Hall of the Fallen, where they were cared for. Raoden hoped some of the Hoed might surface with care. While this never came to pass, the Hoed in the Hall of the Fallen were noticeably calmer than Hoed on the streets.

## Reversal
If a Hoed is placed in the [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Lake]], their body will appear to dissolve. As the Lake is a [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]], it likely transfers those placed in it to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. As the Selish Cognitive Realm is incredibly dangerous, these people are likely then destroyed by the [[Dor\|Dor]], though at least one pre-Reod Elantrian, [[Riino\|Riino]], survived.

### Restoration
When the large Aon Rao of Elantris city was completed with the chasm line, the Elantrians were restored to their former glory. Because Raoden and [[Dashe\|Dashe]], who were Hoed, regained their minds, it is assumed that the rest of the Hoed did as well.

## Trivia
The word "Hoed" is based off the Aon "Oed".
