## Appearance and Personality
Hrdalm has a jovial and companionable personality. He is very helpful, more than willing to work with Adolin to take down the [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]]. Hrdalm expressed deep gratitude towards Adolin and reverence to [[Mayalaran\|Maya]] when Adolin lent Hrdalm the [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] after he was unable to continue the battle.
Hrdalm's physical appearance is unknown, but he often wears his black Shardplate. The helm had stylized Thaylen eyebrows shaped like backward sweeping knives. The Plate was painted black and skirted with a triangular pattern of interlocking scales.
Hrdalm is able to speak in broken [[Alethi\|Alethi]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Hrdalm owns the [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] named [[Cvaderln\|Cvaderln]], which had been in his family for generations. He has been trained to use Shardplate and a [[Shardhammer\|Shardhammer]], both of which he owns. He is also capable of ably using a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. He is very skilled with his Shards, able to capably defend himself against both a thunderclast and the [[Fused\|Fused]].

## History
As Hrdalm possesses [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], he was born into one of the eight ancient Thaylen houses to own Shards. Hrdalm likely received his Shard from his father in his youth. After receiving his Shard, he served as a member of the highguard, protecting the Thaylen throne.
In 1174, during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Hrdalm came to help Adolin fight the [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]] [[Kai-garnis\|Kai-garnis]]. He agreed to act as distraction for the monster while Adolin attacked it. However he shortly ended up being pinned by two [[Fused\|Fused]] and saved by Adolin throwing [[Maya\|Maya]] at one of the Fused. He expressed amazement at this feat. After Adolin was chased by the thunderclast down to a lower tier of the city, Hrdalm somehow lost his [[Shardhammer\|Shardhammer]] during the fighting but eventually began using one of the Fused's lances. Hrdalm then climbed down to the lower tier himself and found the injured Adolin. He commanded Adolin to rest as he was too injured to continue. Adolin lent Maya to Hrdalm for the rest of the battle against the thunderclast. He expressed deep reverence and gratitude to Adolin for his generosity. Hrdlam and [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]] immobilized the thunderclast together, Renarin serving as a distraction while Hrdalm cut both of the thunderclast's legs off at the knees.
