Brightlord **Tasinar** is one of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] former slavers on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Tasinar uses the title "Brightlord" and is therefore a [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]; he is likely [[Alethi\|Alethi]], although it is possible that he hails from another [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nation. Like many lighteyes, he has little regard for the lives of [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]]. When some of his slaves are killed, he bemoans the fact that his property is being destroyed.

## History
Tasinar owned Kaladin after his expulsion from [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army. One of Tasinar's other slaves at the time was named [[Nalma\|Nalma]], whom Kaladin befriended. He promised to help her escape so that she could find her husband, who was illegally sold to a different slaver. Kaladin led Nalma and a few other slaves on his most successful escape attempt as a slave; they were able to hide in the forest for about a week. Tasinar sent a hunting party of [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]—including a local highlord—to find the escapees, and they steadily closed in. The hunting party used brutal techniques, and all of the slaves except Kaladin were killed during their capture. Kaladin was with Nalma when she died, and her death had a lasting emotional effect on him. Kaladin was later reminded of the escape attempt from Tasinar when he was crossing through fields and forests with the [[Singer\|singer]] group that he encountered after the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].
