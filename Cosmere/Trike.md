**Trike** is a food fish that lives in the [[Sea of Fjorden\|Sea of Fjorden]] on Sel.
While discussing crop farming in [[New Elantris\|New Elantris]], [[Galladon\|Galladon]] and [[Raoden\|Raoden]] decide to ask [[Sarene\|Sarene]] for trike. They correctly predict that she will assume they want it for food and spitefully provide rotten fish, concealing their true intent to use it as fertilizer.
