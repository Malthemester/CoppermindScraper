## Lore
Each Island has a name and personality associated with it. The islands are considered the [[Eelakin\|Eelakin's]] gods. [[Patji (island)\|Patji]] is the ruler of the islands, also known as **The Father**. [[Trapper\|Trappers]] are trained on [[Sori\|Sori]] and, once finished with their apprenticeship, choose an island to trap for the rest of their lives. They are considered priests of the island. With the exception of the island Sori, trappers tend not to visit the other islands.

## Population
These islands, unlike the [[Homeisles\|Homeisles]], are only inhabited by a small number of nomadic Eelakin trappers, estimated a few dozen, who maintain small hidden camps within the island.

## Trade
The islands are host to a number of exotic species, one of which is a species of birds called [[Aviar\|Aviar]] who host a magical parasite that gives them unique powers. Most notable of these powers is the ability to conceal minds from predators that are able to locate creatures by sensing their minds.

## Dangers
The Pantheon is home to a very large number of extremely dangerous plants and animals. Most notable of these are [[Deepwalker\|Deepwalkers]], leviathan-like beasts that live beneath the water and hunt the waters and shores of the islands. A large number of the animals hunt via detection of thoughts. Almost all plants and animals on Patji can kill swiftly. The smallest island, Sori, is apparently more forgiving, but is still dangerous.
