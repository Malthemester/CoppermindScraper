**Dandos Heraldin**, also known as **Dandos the Oilsworn**, was a master artist with pencils on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He was also knowledgeable about mathematics and created the study of ratios in art.
[[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] learned how to draw by reading one of his books, though Dandos himself had died three hundred years previously. In his teachings he advised that aspiring artists should paint self-portraits.
[[Mraize\|Mraize]] used some of Oilsworn's art to bait [[Shalash\|Shalash]] into meeting him; she found a picture she wanted to destroy in his laundry room, and he cornered her after she slashed it.
