**Clema** is a crop grown on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is labor-intensive to grow, similar to [[Tallew\|tallew]] or [[Lavis\|lavis]], and cannot easily survive flooding.

## Clemabread
Clema can be baked into large rolls known as **clemabread**. Clemabread is common in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]], and it is likely made in other parts of Roshar; [[Lift\|Lift]] appears to be familiar with it when she arrives in [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]]. The bread is granular and breaks apart easily, giving it a mushy texture when eaten. The rolls often have a spicy paste at the center and can be served warm.
Clemabread is presumably cheap to make, as the [[Stump\|Stump]] often serves it at [[Tashi's Light Orphanage\|Tashi's Light Orphanage]]. According to Lift, this clemabread is "only *slightly* better than gruel, which is only *slightly* better than cold socks."
