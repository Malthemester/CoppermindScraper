Callsign **Tunestone** is a member of [[Nightmare Flight\|Nightmare Flight]] along with [[Nose\|Nose]], [[Bog\|Bog]], [[Sushi\|Sushi]], [[Jager\|Jager]], and [[Nord\|Nord]]. She has a high pitched voice and comes across as dismissive.
Tunestone, along with her flight mates, accompanied [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] in a routine mission to tag debris. Paired with [[FM\|FM]] and [[Spensa\|Spensa]], Tunestone and her wingmate Bog attempted to show off their [[Light-lance\|light-lance]] skills, assuming the cadets to not be overly familiar with the manoeuvres. Neither of the cadets found the display overly impressive, and in turn they demonstrated their own competency using a light-lance. Later, when the group were attacked by [[Varvax\|Krell]] ships, Tunestone was ordered by her flightleader, Nose, to fly defensively and keep an eye out for [[Lifebuster\|Lifebusters]] until reinforcements arrived.
Later, Nightmare Flight participated in the [[Battle of Alta Second\|Battle of Alta Second]].
