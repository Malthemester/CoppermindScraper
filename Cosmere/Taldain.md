## Geography and Ecology
Taldain is a tidally locked planet, one side of the world experiences perpetual day and the other side is locked in an endless night. Due to this the ecology and culture on both sides of the planet developed separately from one another, there is a temperature difference between the two halves but it does not snow on Darkside. There are two prominent cultures on Taldain; Dayside and Darkside. These individuals are named 'Daysiders' and 'Darksiders' respectively.

### Dayside
Most of the planets Investiture is found on Dayside. Much of Dayside is covered in [[Sand (Taldain)\|sand]] and rock, this sand is itself covered by lichen. This lichen is where the striking color of the sand comes from as well as its change in color. Due to the harshness of the sunlight most of its flora and fauna live beneath the surface of the sand where it is cooler.
**Dayside** is home to one large circular landmass that is surrounded by ocean on all sides. On this landmass there are six nations; [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]], [[Lossand\|Lossand]], [[Denka\|Denka]], [[Seevis\|Seevis]], [[Nor'Tallon\|Nor'Tallon]] and [[Tallon\|Tallon]]. There is a mountain range on the eastern side of the landmass, which runs through Nor'Tallon and borders Seevis and Tallon. A mountain named [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]] lies at the center of Dayside. A wide variety of different types of Flora and Fauna make their home on this part of the planet.


The [[Dorim vine\|Dorim vine]] is a plant used as a water source on Dayside by its inhabitants, areas where they grow are not considered to be desert. The plant stores water primarily as a defensive measure against other creatures as its water dissolves the shells of many sand creatures. Because of this any creature attempting to eat the plant would find their mouths beginning to melt. Because of this the growth of Dorim vines as a result limits how large sandlings can grow.
The city of Kezare someis cultivated for farming and is more fertile than the low sand regions, as a result of this it has more varied flora. The Darkside quarter of the city also has flowers native to Darkside growing within it.


[[Sandling\|Sandlings]] inhabit the areas known as the deep sands on the continent, it is rare for them to venture far from the deepsands. Sandlings live by eating the layer of sand exposed to the surface, similar to what happens when it is used for Sand Mastery the sand turns dull after being digested and needs to recharge.
There are multiple breeds of this type of creature, some of them such as Karaks are hunted for sport. Another breed consists of thousands of small sandlings which stick together in the Deep sands, when they move they agitate the sand above them causing them to be mistake for a much larger creature forcing wanders to retreat. Delrak Naisha are another breed found in the deep sands. They are creatures that wait just beneath the sand, if the sand above them are disturbed they emerge and consume whatever is above it.
[[Tonk\|Tonks]] are a type of domesticated animal on Dayside unrelated to Sandlings, they are primarily used as mounts. They are scared of water however and refuse to cross it limiting where they can be taken to. Travelling with Tonks is also frustrated because of their natural instinct to bury themselves underneath sand during a sandstorm and their tendency to mistake many things for sandstorms.

### Darkside
Darkside is illuminated primarily by UV light, the flora having adapted to utilize this section of the electromagnetic spectrum. This causes **Darksiders** to have illuminated teeth, eyes, and nails. The plant and animal life also glows under UV light and glows in this manner, visitors to the region often describe it as looking somewhere between striking and garish. It also accounts for why Darksiders have dark skin when they don't live in a traditional climate for high melanin content. Most of Darkside is covered in a lichen. When visiting Dayside, Darksiders must wear dark lenses to protect their eyes. They can go without, however, if the angle of the sun is not directly above them. 
Unlike what was once assumed, Darkside is invested by [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], though the effects of this aren't as noticeable.

## History
The planet was placed in its current location purposefully. It is unknown whether it existed before being put in its current location. After the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] Autonomy settled into the star system as the sole Shard present. At some point, the planet was settled by humans. Due to how the genetics of the settlers played out, Daysiders ended up with pale skin.
Upon its arrival an avatar of Autonomy began to be noticed by people from Dayside and became known as the [[Sand Lord\|Sand Lord]]. This being eventually became important to [[Ker'Reen Philosophy\|Ker'Reen Philosophy]], and the dominant object of worship for the people of [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]]. Different religious belief was formed in the [[Diem\|Diem]], an important part of the government of [[Lossand\|Lossand]]. This difference of faith led to frequent war between Lossand and Kerzta. Peace was eventually gained when the high priest government of Kerzta was replaced by a merchant nobility.
After 200 years, there was a push again by the A’kar, the head priest of Ker’Reen Philosophy, to take control by diplomatic means. In an attempt to win favour with the public, they wiped out the Diem, their long-standing rivals, and claimed it was done to please the Sand Lord.  This failed, however, and the Diem managed to recover. As a result, support for the A’kar crumbled and they failed to take control of the Kerzta government.
For unknown reasons, the planet became closed off to visitors. This change in behaviour is usually attributed to Autonomy. Around the same time, Taldain stopped progressing technologically, where once it was the most advanced of all the planets. Later, it became possible to visit Taldain again.

## Culture
The culture of Taldain is split between the Dayside and Darkside due to the planets unique geography.

### Dayside
Because the sun does not set on **Dayside** individuals living there have a variety of issues that needed to be resolved. In regards to keeping time an hour on Taldain is 100 minutes long. Because of its stationary nature many Daysiders find it easy to navigate by using the sun as a reference point. Due to its ever present nature many Daysiders feel a spiritual bond with their sun, and some, such as the Kerztians, worship it. Most Daysiders are afraid of the dark as well being unused to it.
On Dayside there is a large circular continent that can be found, on this landmass there are a variety of countries. The largest and most powerful nations is [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]] which is located on the western portion of the Dayside continent. Its people worship the [[Sand Lord\|Sand Lord]] and abide by the [[Ker'Reen Philosophy\|Ker'Reen Philosophy]]. [[Lossand\|Lossand]] is a country that is immediately next to it and stretches in a wedge from [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]] in the center of the continent to the southern coast around the [[Ry'Do Ali River\|Ry'Do Ali River]]. It is ruled by the Council of [[Taishin\|Taishin]], the heads of the eight Professions vital to their life and culture. Both of these nations have an enmity with one another due to Kerzta accepting Sand mastery, althought they have not been in direct conflict in centuries.
In addition to these countries are the Rim Kingdoms which are a series of smaller nations on the eastern and north-eastern coast of the Dayside continent. They consist of; [[Denka\|Denka]], [[Seevis\|Seevis]], [[Nor'Tallon\|Nor'Tallon]] and [[Tallon\|Tallon]].

### Darkside
On **Darkside** the most powerful and influential force in regards to culture, economics and politics is the [[Dynasty\|Dynasty]]. This force is ruled by [[Skathan\|Skathan]]. Its dominance is so strong that the language Darksiders speak is called Dynastic after the country. It also is the most technologically advanced country in the planet with weapons such as guns and explosives being common creations within its borders. They also had instant noodles, which Hoid enjoyed, and wants [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] to replicate. Despite its dominance some minor nations such as [[Elis\|Elis]] and [[Iiaria\|Iiaria]] resists the Dynasty's push to grow and expand its influence even further. Despite this however the nations power runs deep within Darkside with them being able to send their agents to infiltrate different groups throughout the continent.
The Kerztian word for Darksider is **Lonsha**.

## Astronomy
Taldain is tidally locked around two suns, this makes it unique among other planets in the Cosmere. It is located between the two suns in the system which orbit one another, because of a layer of dust around one of these suns one half of the world is trapped in endless sunlight and the other half in night. This placement was done purposefully by its creator. It is the only planet within the system and a single moon, Nizh Da, has a polar orbit around the world.  An hour on Taldain is 100 minutes long.

## Magic System
The world of Taldain has been settled by Autonomy and as a result its investure can be found throughout the planet, primarily in the atmosphere. Autonomy has allowed it to spread unusually making it in theory easy to access, a [[Returned\|Returned]] for instance would have little difficulty living on Taldain and one could also theoretically access the worlds investure on another planet so long as they can see the star system. For a time this was the only way to access its magic system as the world was shut off from the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] but eventually it became possible to visit the world again.
The most dramatic form of investure that can be found on the planet is Sand Mastery which is located on Dayside, despite its flashy appearance it uses very little investure however and primarily works through subtle manipulations with [[Connection\|Connection]] between the user, Shard and White Sand. It is believed by residents of Taldain that only Dayside was invested by the Shard however this is incorrect and in fact both parts of the world are invested with the majority of it falling on Dayside. Darkside magic primarily functions through tattoos but its effects are not nearly as noticeable.
