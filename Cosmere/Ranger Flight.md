**Ranger Flight** is a flight of [[DDF\|DDF]] pilots that work as scouts. There was originally at least eight members of Ranger Flight. They pilot [[Val\|Val]]-class ships, which are designed for reconnaissance, scanner avoidance, and speed.

## History
Ranger Flight joined [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] under the command of [[Jorgen\|Jorgen]] in the battle where [[Hurl\|Hurl]] died, identifying enemy ships and relaying the information back to Flight Command.
In the [[Battle of Alta Second\|Battle of Alta Second]], Ranger Flight was combined with the other scout groups. [[Cloak\|Cloak]] reported the number of Krell ships to Admiral [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]], as well as confirmed that a [[Lifebuster\|lifebuster]] had been sent by the enemy. On Ironsides' order, the scouts drove the lifebuster away from the shipyard, and it changed its course to instead head towards Alta, moving faster than expected. With the other pilots occupied, Ironsides ordered the scouts to engage with the lifebuster and its defense ships. They successfully managed to destroy the lifebuster, however, in doing so, the bomb it had been carrying was dropped onto the surface of Detritus, killing Cloak along with eight other scouts.

Ranger Flight was involved in a battle against the [[Superiority\|Superiority]] when they tried to use a battleship to bombard Detritus. [[Stallion\|One member of their flight]] got stuck outside of Detritus when the shield came online, and met up with Jorgen to be hyperjumped to the other side of the shield, via a [[Taynix\|taynix]].
