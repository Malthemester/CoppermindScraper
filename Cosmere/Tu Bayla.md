**Tu Bayla** is a nation on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
[[Ru Parat\|Ru Parat]] and [[Fu Namir\|Fu Namir]] are cities in the region. It borders [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] to the east, the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]] to the north, a mountain range to the south, and shares land borders with [[Yulay\|Yulay]] and [[Marabethia\|Marabethia]] to the west, as well as forming the eastern coast of the [[Purelake\|Purelake]]. It seems to have at least one river that runs into the Purelake and another that runs into the Reshi Sea, and may also claim some of the Reshi isles close to its coast. It is formed from parts of the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] of [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]] and [[Valhav\|Valhav]].
Its people are nomadic. [[Tyn\|Tyn]] grew up there. [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] lays in the mountain ranges to the south of Tu Bayla.
When [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] commented on the similarities between [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and the [[Sunmaker\|Sunmaker]] he refers to the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] as being organized in tribes, and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] retorts that the Alethi aren't the same as the nomads that live in Tu Bayla. Shortly after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] contemplates invading Tu Bayla to counter possible invasions into Jah Keved, which threatened to split the coalition's territory in two.
