>“*All things exist in three Realms, Gaotona. Physical, Cognitive, Spiritual. The Physical is what we feel, what is before us. The Cognitive is how an object is viewed and how it views itself. The Spiritual Realm contains an object’s soul—its essence—as well as the ways it is connected to the things and people around it.*”
\-Shai discussing the application of Realmatic Theory to Forgery with Gaotona[1]


**Realmatic Theory** refers to the study of the three Realms—Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual—that constitute the fundamental structure of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Along with other fundamental properties like space and time, the Realms were created at the cosmere's equivalent of the , before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]].

>“*All things exist in three realms, Dalinar. The Physical: what you are now. The Cognitive: what you see yourself as being. The Spiritual: the perfect you, the person beyond pain, and error, and uncertainty.*”
\-Nohadon to Dalinar[3]


### Physical Realm
For more information, see [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]].
Of the three Realms, the **Physical Realm** is the most readily understood as it behaves in much the same way that our universe does. It is the natural world as we experience it with our senses, consisting of space and time and adhering to empirical scientific law. Unlike the Cognitive Realm, the Physical Realm is a three-dimensional plane. The two Realms are not mapped perfectly to each other for this reason. The cosmere is a single star cluster within the Physical Realm consisting of between fifty and one hundred stars, though at least one person has tried to travel beyond that. Travel between planets within the cluster can be achieved without using either of the other Realms through purely Physical FTL travel.
Investiture within the Physical Realm will manifest as a solid, liquid, or gas. Solid Investiture in the Physical Realm is metallic. Pushing the entirety of a Shard’s Investiture into the Physical Realm would have disastrous effects. Changes in the Spiritual Realm filter down to and cause changes in the Physical Realm. Perception has a part in those Physical changes. After a person dies, they need a continued tie to the Physical Realm to prevent passing to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]] after death. Someone with such a tie could become a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]].

### Cognitive Realm
 by Yasen Stoilov [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Adolin\|Adolin]] in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]
For more information, see [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
The **Cognitive Realm** is the world of thought and perception. It is known locally on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] as **Shadesmar**, though at least some academics of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] have taken to using the term to refer to the entire Realm. A planet's reflection in the Cognitive Realm is referred to as a subastral. The nature and appearance of objects in this Realm are shaped by the views of people and even the objects themselves. The environment itself changes from one world to the next, often exhibiting features characteristic of that world. [[Investiture\|Investiture]], including that within souls, glows visibly within the Cognitive Realm.
While time appears to flow normally, space is also warped by perception. Some aspect of the nature of the Realm allows one to walk to space, and the distance between worlds is significantly contracted, so that traveling from one world to the next by foot is possible. Indeed, [[Worldhoppers\|worldhoppers]] generally make use of this Realm to move between worlds. Traveling between the Physical and the Cognitive Realms may be accomplished at [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularities]].
One effect of existing in the Cognitive Realm seems to be unusual longevity, perhaps not aging while in there, allowing worldhoppers to appear in multiple books that take place hundreds of years apart. This attribute of the Cognitive Realm has not been confirmed.

### Spiritual Realm
For more information, see [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]].
The **Spiritual Realm** exists beyond space and time. It is made up entirely of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] and [[Connection\|Connections]]. This Realm contains a person's [[Spiritweb\|Spiritweb]], which is a person’s Spiritual aspect. The Spiritweb is closely related to a soul, but they are not the same. The soul is a philosophical concept while a Spiritweb can be measured and quantified. It also contains information on a thing’s [[Identity\|Identity]], Connection, and [[Fortune\|Fortune]]. Looking into the Spiritual Realm is required for cosmere future sight. Most of the Investiture that makes up a Shard’s power exists within the Spiritual Realm.

## Interactions
### Perception
Perception is a vital part of how the three versions of a person or an object interact with each other. The Spiritual Realm filters through the Cognitive Realm to get to the Physical Realm. While the Spiritual Realm contains the ideal version of something, the Cognitive filter makes sure the Physical version matches their perception of what should be. One of the ways this manifests is in healing. For example, until he swears his Fourth Ideal, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] feels he deserves his slave brands, so they don’t heal. [[Lopen\|Lopen]], on the other hand, never viewed himself as disabled, so his arm grew back. The application of this can extend to changing the body of a transgender person to match their identity or rejoining  that were separated.
Perception is also important for how the Invested Arts interact with the three Realms. What a person thinks they can do often limits what they can actually do. For example, [[Shallan\|Shallan]] required ten heartbeats to summon [[Pattern\|Pattern]] as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]], despite him being a living blade. Perception makes using a [[Soulstamp\|soulstamp]] on an object easier or more difficult. The more an object is viewed as a whole, the easier it is to soulstamp. Perception of an object can and does change over time. As an object changes owner or various ingredients are combined into a whole, people’s perception of the objects change. The transition does not happen instantaneously. There will be a period of time when the line is fuzzy and multiple perceptions of an object can be true.

### Investiture
>“*Giving water to the tiny plant causes a chain reaction of sudden growth, energy, and Realmic transition. Certain people can control this reaction, using the water from their own bodies to forge a brief cognitive bond. They can draw Investiture (in very small amounts) directly from the Spiritual Realm, and use that to control the sand.*”
\-Khriss's assessment of Dayside's magic system, sand mastery.[32]


In addition to having ordinary mass and energy, the cosmere also has a magical power known as [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Investiture is closely tied to the Spiritual Realm, which holds a vast reserve of Investiture, but ultimately transcends the divisions between the three Realms. Over time, Investiture will cycle between the Realms, but ultimately returns to the Spiritual Realm. Like matter and energy, high concentrations of Investiture curve space, but it primarily affects the geometry of the Realms and brings them closer together rather than creating ordinary gravitational effects. At a certain point, this effect will cause a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] to form.

### Perpendicularities
 by  Wanda Sonnemann  [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] opening up [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]]
>“*In general, perpendicularities are created by the presence of a Shard on the planet. The concentration of so much Investiture on the Cognitive and Physical Realms creates points of ... friction, where a kind of tunneling exists. At these points, Physical matter, Cognitive thought, and Spiritual essence become one—and a being can slide between Realms.*”
\-Khriss on perpendicularities[41]


Under certain circumstances, the Realms will bend to the point where they are no longer separate and are instead connected by a [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]]. The most common cause of a perpendicularity is a high concentration of Investiture in either the Physical or Cognitive Realms—though this is harder to achieve in the Cognitive Realm—but other methods work as well. Because they are built out of Investiture, a perpendicularity will collapse if [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] is used to attack it.
Perpendicularities can be used to see into the Spiritual Realm and to transition between Realms, though someone has to know what the perpendicularity does in order to use it. This requirement gets weird for non-sapient things, but a creature like an [[Aviar\|Aviar]] could reasonably transition between Realms with a perpendicularity. Perpendicularities are the most common method [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] use to transition between the Realms, but they are not the only method.
As a large amount of Investiture is generally required to create a perpendicularity, they most often appear when a [[Shard\|Shard]] takes up residence on a world. The process of creating a perpendicularity begins to occur naturally once a Shard arrives on a world, but Shards can control where and how the perpendicularity manifests. They can also choose to create more than one, to create one on a world they do not inhabit, and to share in the creation of one with another Shard. A perpendicularity generated by a Shard will usually remain in place if the Shard's Vessel dies, but not always.
While most perpendicularities are created by Shards, they can also be created by other methods. Some Invested Arts, like the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Transportation, are particularly built to accomplish this. Other methods of creating a perpendicularity include storing a sufficient amount of Investiture in a nicrosilmind, an unknown method of "morbid origin" used on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] that creates predictably unstable and hard to predict perpendicularities, and an unspecified ability of [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Bondsmiths]] bonded to the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] after [[Honor\|Honor's]] death.

### Shards
>“*Men—all things, truly—are like a ray of light. The floor is the Physical Realm, where that light pools. The sun is the Spiritual Realm, where it begins. This Realm, the Cognitive Realm, is the space between where that beam stretches.*”
\-Leras to Kelsier[15]

While the Shards of Adonalsium exist primarily in the Spiritual Realm, their immense power has notable effects on all three of the Realms. Perhaps most significantly, Realmatic interactions between a Shard and a planet are what define the structure of any Invested Arts associated with that Shard on that planet. Shards can consciously make some changes to this structure, but the extent to which they can interfere is limited. If a Shard used their power to create the planet in the first place (as [[Preservation\|Preservation]] and [[Ruin\|Ruin]] did with [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]), they will be able to exercise more control.
As Shards are composed of a significant amount of Investiture, their presence also bends the local Realmatic geometry. This effect is mostly limited to the Cognitive Realm, where a Shard's presence is partially responsible for the planet's subastral taking up a relatively large space compared to the space between planets. If a Shard remains in a system for some time, this Realmatic bending will generally result in the formation of a perpendicularity. If a Shard wishes, they may also use their Investiture to curve the Realms in a way that creates a body in the Physical Realm.

## Culture
### Nalthis
On [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]] stumbled upon Realmatic Theory and the broader [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] during their studies and are known among the scholars of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] for their discoveries. Subsequent Nalthian scholars appear to have retained some of the Five Scholars' knowledge and, aside from worldhoppers, are probably the most aware of the mechanics of the cosmere. Indeed, the Nalthian perpendicularity has customs, suggesting Nalthis has a sizable population with at least some Realmatic awareness.

### Roshar
On [[Roshar\|Roshar]], the philosopher [[Gavarah\|Gavarah]] first developed Realmatic Theory some time well before 1173. Since then, her theory appears to have become widely accepted among scholars, who are aware that the Spiritual Realm is a place of pure truth but the Cognitive Realm is more malleable. However, it appears that few, if any, scholars have actually studied it in detail, as [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] was unable to find much information on the Cognitive Realm with six years of research. This difficulty may be compounded by the fact that some religions have integrated aspects of Realmatic Theory into their theology, though the return of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] and the reactivation of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] may soon lead to new knowledge.

### Scadrial
>“*I have come to see that each power has three aspects: a physical one, which can be seen in the creations made by Ruin and Preservation; a spiritual one in the unseen energy that permeates all of the world; and a cognitive one in the minds which controlled that energy.*”
\-Sazed's earliest experiences after his ascension.[77]

On [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], the ancient [[Terris\|Terris]] were aware of Realmatic Theory and included it in their religion. This knowledge may have come from experimentation with [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], which organizes its metals into quadrants based on which Realms they affect. Their research into Realmatic Theory appears to have been an ongoing affair; when he met [[Alendi\|Alendi]], the [[Worldbringer\|Worldbringer]] [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]] was studying the Cognitive aspects of trees. Much of this knowledge appears to have been lost when [[Rashek\|Rashek]] destroyed the Terris religion, though at least some of it was retained by the First Generation of the [[Kandra\|kandra]].
[[Sazed\|Sazed]] included some basic information on Realmatic Theory in the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]]. Since the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], the Terris have been experimenting with the Feruchemical metals that store Spiritual properties, but refuse to speak of those powers with non-Terris. The kandra and the [[Set\|Set]] have also been conducting research and have likewise been keeping it quiet. As a result of this secrecy, the people of the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] at-large seem to have little more knowledge of Realmatic Theory than they received in the Words of Founding. However, this situation may soon change as the people of the Basin begin to interact with the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]].
The people of Southern Scadrial have a much more advanced understanding of Realmatic Theory. Ten years after the Catacendre, [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] arrived in their lands and gave them the tools and knowledge needed to make [[Unsealed metalminds\|unsealed]] brassminds. After he left, the Southern Scadrians were able to use what they knew to figure out how to make unsealed metalminds for all abilities in the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]]. They have been unable to create unsealed metalminds that grant more than three abilities, suggesting that the Realmatic principles involved become more complex as more abilities are added to the metalmind.

### Sel
 by  Lyraina  [[Shai\|Shai]] explaining Realmatic Theory to [[Gaotona\|Gaotona]]
The people of [[Sel\|Sel]] have developed the most advanced knowledge of Realmatic Theory of any planet in the cosmere. The [[MaiPon\|MaiPon]] learned much about Realmatic Theory and how it relates to [[Forgery\|Forgery]] by study and observation and are aware of concepts like Identity and Connection. The [[Ire\|Ire]], and perhaps other pre-[[Reod\|Reod]] [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]], similarly had an advanced understanding of Realmatic Theory.

### Silverlight
Well before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the city of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] was founded. Located entirely in the Cognitive Realm, Silverlight is home to many worldhoppers who have settled down as well as several people who live their entire lives there. Located as it is in the Cognitive Realm, most of Silverlight's residents are aware of the mechanics of the cosmere. Additionally, Silverlight is also home to several universities with scholars who study the cosmere, at least one of which was founded by [[Khriss\|Khriss]].

## Development
The inspiration for Realmatic Theory comes from a number of real-world philosophies. Those philosophies include ’s ,  beliefs,, and . Plato’s theory of forms is the original concept for the Realms. The theory of forms states that the physical world is merely an imitation of the ideal essences of all things. This true ideal matches up with the Spiritual Realm, and the human perception of ideals matches up with the Cognitive Realm. While Plato’s philosophy only includes two forms, Brandon uses three. The idea that everything has a spren comes from Shinto beliefs. Spinoza’s influence is in God being in everything and everything being made of one substance. Brandon’s interpretation of this is the Shards’ Investiture permeating everything in the cosmere. Other, more minor influences include  in the concept of Connection, idealism,, and the  thought experiment. The large number of philosophical influences on Realmatic Theory and the cosmere is because Brandon finds philosophy interesting. He took many philosophy classes in college.
Realmatic Theory was first used in *Dragonsteel*, Brandon’s second book set in the cosmere. The opening chapters include someone learning about the three Realms in a classroom. As Brandon wrote more cosmere books, he noticed patterns in the themes. He began to create a common energy source for the magic systems to use. Linking the books and creating the cosmere grew naturally from those themes and connections. Within the currently published cosmere, the term Realmatic Theory has only been used twice, once by the [[Ire\|Ire]] and once by [[Shalash\|Shalash]]. Khriss has used the phrase "Realmatic Transition" in the *Words of Radiance* [[Ars Arcanum\|Ars Arcanum]] to describe the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Transportation. She also used the phrase "Realmic transition" once in the essay on the [[Taldain system\|Taldain system]] to describe how [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]] works. The difference, if any, between these two terms is as yet unknown.
