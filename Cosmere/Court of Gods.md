\-Blushweaver to the Court of Gods[1]


The **Court of Gods** is the home and parliament of the [[Returned\|Returned]] in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. While the Returned effectively rule the nation, they are confined inside the walls of this complex in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]], the capital of Hallandren.
The Court of Gods is composed of the [[God King\|God King's]] palace, a many-roomed building in the center of the court, which holds rooms in every shade of red, green and blue. The rooms had no specific function, as the servants would bring in whatever was desired in whichever room they were in (ex. bath, dining table, bed). Around this structure stand the various Returned's palaces, each in the colors of the Returned who resides within, as well as the priests and staff who care for them. The palaces and the staff were color coordinated to match the colors of the god in residence. The [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] [[Lifeless Enclave\|barracks]] are situated at the base of the Court.
The political issues of Hallandren are resolved in the Court Assembly. In order to get in, you'd either need to be favored by one of the gods, be extremely influential (50 Breaths / the 1st Heightening), or win a lottery. Priests are not allowed to talk about court politics.
[[Bluefingers\|Bluefingers]] is the head scribe, who keeps the court running. He oversees all the servants in the Court of Gods.
The Court of Gods is an extravagant place in which every want or need of its Returned inhabitants are met, from luxurious food to exotic performances. The Returned live in luxury until they deem it fit to give their Divine Breath to a person with a need they find worthy. At the time of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]], however, most of the Returned are content to live in excess and are apathetic to the wants and needs of the general populace. As such, much of their considerable political power lies with their priests, and no Returned has sacrificed themselves in three years, leading to some resentment among Hallandren's citizens.
The [[Returned\|Returned]] Gods and their Queen are not allowed to leave the Court of Gods.
The Court of Gods controls an army of 40,000 Lifeless soldiers. They are divided them into 4 groups, giving command of 10,000 each to [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]], [[Allmother\|Allmother]], [[Mercystar\|Mercystar]], and [[Hopefinder\|Hopefinder]].

## History
At the conclusion of the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] around 300 years ago, the Court of Gods formed, as the royals were driven to the highlands.
The Court of Gods formed a treaty with [[Idris\|Idris]] in approximately the year 307, in which King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] would send his daughter to be married to [[Susebron\|Susebron]], the God King. This treaty would further legitimize the Courts claim to rule in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], as an heir would have the royal blood and presumably Royal Locks (something the people of Hallandren desired).
In the year 327, the Court of Gods was challenged by the [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] rebellion. The people of Hallandren were mad at the Gods, who had become complacent and apathetic towards the needs of the people. It had been 3 years since a God had sacrificed their Divine Breath to heal someone. This rebellion was supported by [[Idris\|Idris]] via their spy [[Lemex\|Lemex]], along with several slumlords.
The rebellion was quelled when [[Bluefingers\|Bluefingers]] informed the court of [[Vahr\|Vahr's]] location, after which he was captured and tortured in one of their dungeons. He was kept alive as the court desired his breath. His capture and eventual death at the hands of [[Vasher\|Vasher]] effectively ended the rebellion.
Around this time, Dedelin decided to send his youngest daughter, [[Siri\|Siri]], instead of his oldest daughter [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]], as the treaty had not stipulated which daughter would be married to [[Susebron\|Susebron]]. This agitated the court, spurring more talk of war.
Had Idris sent nobody, it would have meant all out war. The argument against the war was the lands held by the Idrians was undesirable and cold. The main argument for the war was to claim and protect the trade routes, as being cut off from them would lead to full economic collapse in [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]].
Siri's arrival started the Wedding Jubilation within the court, which was a weeklong celebration. This marked the first time they'd had a queen in 30 years
A [[Reacher\|Reacher]] in [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] tries to sell a painting from the Court of Gods to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] for three hundred [[Broam\|broams]] worth of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. The painting, by [[Nenefra\|Nenefra]], seems to Kaladin to depict nine shadows, with a figure kneeling in the middle (the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] and [[Odium\|Odium's]] champion). The painting is small, painted from thick strokes of oil. It has red and black colors, and seems sloppy, as if it had been carelessly painted with a knife.

## Members
The court holds around 2 dozen gods, including the God King. The Court Assembly has room for around 50 gods.
