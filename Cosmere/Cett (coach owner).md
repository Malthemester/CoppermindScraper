An unnamed member of the **Cett** family is the owner and operator of [[Ashweather Carriage and Coach\|Ashweather Carriage and Coach]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is pudgy, and he wears a formal suit with a waistcoat and long tails. His primary interest is making money, and he pays more respect to people from noble houses than he would an average citizen. He is willing to use immoral and illegal methods to advance his business.

## History
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] follows a lead to Ashweather Carriage and Coach while pursuing [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]]. Wax has a general dislike of the Cett family due to their avarice, and he immediately identifies the proprietor as a Cett by his appearance and body language. Wax asks a number of questions about the business and grows suspicious of Cett's eagerness to accomodate his requests. In Cett's records, Wax finds that a coach was hired by someone using the [[Terris\|Terris]] word for "secret", piquing his interest. The coach in question, driven by [[Chapaou\|Chapaou]], did in fact carry Bleeder.
Wax ultimately realizes that Cett does not know anything about Bleeder, but he still believes that he is hiding something. After learning that Cett employs a [[Coinshot\|Coinshot]] to scout the streets for clients, Wax correctly guesses that Cett also employs a [[Rioter\|Rioter]] to drum up more business, an illegal activity under the [[Allomantic Agreement of '94\|Allomantic Agreement of '94]]. Wax tells Cett that he will be reporting this crime to the constable-general.
