The **Steel alphabet** was the set of glyphs used on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It has been shown that the glyphs evolved over time.
Most of the symbols were also used to represent various metals and numbers. The steel alphabet used a base-16 numbering system with a positional structure similar to —double-number pairs are used to represent the order of magnitude and the number in that position respectively.
At some point the alphabet diverged such that the symbols used to represent [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] metals were distinct to those used by [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and the general alphabet.
During the technological advancement after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]], the symbols used during the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] were tweaked to become easier for printing.

>“*The three sets of symbols show the progression of the Allomantic text through the ages. The earliest script is from Hero of Ages. It was changed and modified into the Terris script symbols we see in Well of Ascension. After more time, the Terris script morphed into what is now known as the Allomantic Alphabet or the Steel Alphabet, which are the symbols used in Mistborn: The Final Empire. We've extrapolated the Steel Alphabet into a script that's more-standardized and refined for the chapter headings in Alloy of Law, which takes place 300 years after Hero of Ages.*”

## Symbols and their Meanings
The mapping between the English and Steel alphabet was first achieved by Valkynphyre of the 17th Shard. The tin & pewter symbols corresponding to E/I and O/U are distinct, and can be identified by the position of the dot; E places the dot below and to the left of the spike, similar to the O placement, and U places the dot next to the top of the outer curved spike. The letter Q is not present in the alphabet.
The Steel glyphs corresponding to the eight basic metals are also used to express (inter)cardinal directions.

## Evolution of the Steel Alphabet
The following table shows both the evolution of the symbols used in the steel alphabet, which have come to be associated with [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], as well as the separate set of symbols that developed to represent the [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]] use of metals.
