## History
Sometime after the rise of [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]], the city of Atlanta turned to salt and began to move across the countryside, with the city constantly rotating. The salt buildings and cars will gradually breakdown when the city moves away, but the disappeared buildings will "grow" back on the direction the city is moving. Due to this, the people of Ildithia have developed transient 'families' that move with the city, relying on tradition and mob-like protection to secure their resources.

## Government
Ildithia is run by a group of Epics known as the [[Coven\|Coven]].

## Current Status
With the disappearance of Larcener, the fate of Ildithia is unknown.
