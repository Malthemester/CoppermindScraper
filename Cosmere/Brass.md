**Brass** is the external mental pushing metal. An Allomancer burning brass is able to dampen the emotions of those around them. It can be targeted at a single person or a group. Feruchemists can use brass to store warmth, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, brass steals Cognitive Feruchemical powers.

## Allomantic Use
A brass [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Soother**. Emotional Allomancy is not mind control, but it does allow the practitioner to influence the emotions of those around them. The effects can be targeted at a specific individual or group, and can focus on specific emotions. Soothing emotions can be used to decrease someone's fatigue, fear, or happiness. It can accomplish many of the same things as [[Zinc\|Rioting]] emotions by Soothing all but the specified emotions. Extreme emotions in the target will interfere with emotional Allomancy. Emotional Allomancy can affect animals, however it requires a certain amount of sapience. Emotional Allomancy also has a more compelling effect on [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] compared to a regular person. Soothers can affect a [[Singer\|singer's]] Rhythms and may be able to dampen [[Odium\|Odium's]] influence.
Very powerful Soothing can put a Hemalurgic creature under complete control, and once controlled, the Soothing is no longer required. This can be achieved by a single [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] or [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgist]] burning [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] and brass together, a combination of a [[Nicrosil\|Nicroburst]] and a Soother, or a group of Soothers and/or Rioters working together, though in the early days of [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], when Allomancy was much more powerful, a single Soother was able to do it.
Soothing inside of a [[Bendalloy\|speed bubble]] could give the same effects as burning duralumin, and can still be aimed without the normal hindrances of exiting time bubbles. Soothing can be stopped by an [[Aluminum\|aluminum]]-lined hat and possibly by aluminum over the Soother's chest.
After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], it is unlawful for a business to use emotional Allomancy to influence customers. This was one of the provisions of the [[Allomantic Agreement of '94\|Allomantic Agreement of '94]]. There is evidence of consensual emotional counselling.

### Savantism
Savanthood is less debilitating for Soothers compared to other metals.

## Feruchemical Use
A brass [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Firesoul**. Brass is used to store warmth. While filling a brassmind, a Firesoul will be cool. A Firesoul's body, not unlike a [[Iron\|Skimmer's]], is able to resist the higher temperatures of their Feruchemy, but are not immune to intense heat in general. By cooling the body by filling a brassmind, however, one could resist higher temperatures; heat would flow to the colder region of their body and then get stored in the brassmind, allowing one to become immune to fire and other sources of intense heat by carefully regulating the rate at which one filled their metalmind.

### Compounding
It is difficult, but possible, for a brass [[Compounding\|Compounder]] to create so much warmth that they can hurt themselves in the process.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, brass steals Cognitive Feruchemical powers ([[Zinc\|zinc]], brass, [[Copper\|copper]], and [[Bronze\|bronze]]).

## Fabrial Use
A [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] with a brass cage will reduce the strength of the fabrial's function.

## Trivia
Brandon made a mistake while writing [[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]]. The Feruchemical effects of brass and [[Electrum\|electrum]] were to be swapped. By the time he realized this was forgotten, however, the book was already in print. Brandon didn't want to retcon this, so the effect of brass was canonized.
