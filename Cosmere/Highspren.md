**Highspren** are a type of sapient [[Spren\|spren]] capable of forming a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]]. Bonding with one makes someone a Knight Radiant of the [[Order of Skybreakers\|Order of Skybreakers]]. Unlike the other kinds of sapient spren, highspren did not stop bonding with Skybreakers after the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Highspren is usually used as a derogatory term.

## Appearance
### Physical Realm
In the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], they take the form of black slits in the air, which can pull open to reveal stars shining within.} When they move, reality seems to bend around them.

### Cognitive Realm
In the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], highspren appear as human-shaped voids through which stars can be seen. Their bodies in Shadesmar are still solid and can be touched as normal. While humans can only recognize them by silhouette, they appear capable of recognizing each other without difficulty. When they move, the starfields seen through their bodies do not appear to move with them.

## Abilities
In the Physical Realm, they are capable of choosing who can hear and see them, and can even hide from their bonded Surgebinder.

### Nahel bond
Highspren are one of the types of spren capable of forming a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]], making a person a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] with the powers of [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]] and [[Division\|Division]]. However, unlike other Radiant spren, highspren do not form a Bond until the prospective Skybreaker swears at least the [[Immortal Words\|Second Ideal]].
Highspren seem to have some kind of empathic connection to their Surgebinders that other spren lack, as they can let the Radiant know their feelings without speaking, even when not in [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] form.

## Culture
Highspren espouse order and law, focusing on obedience and following legal codes. They are infamous among the other spren for being strict and inflexible, with [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] in particular disliking them. They seem to be fairly isolationist, with none to be seen in [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]]. It's possible highspren have their own settlements, as [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] appears to have visited them to gain information about past [[Desolation\|Desolations]].
They seem to highly respect [[Nale\|Nale]], the Skybreaker [[Herald\|Herald]], and will only bond the people he presents them with. Several of them accompany the Skybreaker training excursions to observe and assess the hopefuls, with each highspren waiting for one who would impress them, though it's possible that the ultimate decision of whether or not to bond a person is formed by the entire group. Once the bond is formed, they seem to have a largely commanding role in it, as it is up to them whether or not a Skybreaker is considered to have successfully accomplished the Ideal of Crusade.
