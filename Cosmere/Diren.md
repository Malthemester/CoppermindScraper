**Diren** was an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].
Prior to his [[Shaod\|Shaod]] he worked on [[Aor Plantation\|Aor Plantation]]. After about eight months he is brought to [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] to be questioned so he can learn about Elantris. After this he is taken by [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]], who cuts his face deeply several times, leading to Diren losing his sanity.
He is nearly executed by [[Dilaf\|Dilaf]] during a congregation, which is stopped by [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] to ensure that the crowd does not enter an uncontrollable zealous fervor. Diren is then put out of his misery by [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]] personally.
