**Narbin** is a type of simple woven cloth on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
It is presumably made from a plant that grows near the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]] and the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], as the [[Listener\|listeners]] wore narbin clothing before they were "discovered" by [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] circa 1165. Narbin cloth may also be used in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], as [[Matain\|Matain]] was able to easily identify it.
