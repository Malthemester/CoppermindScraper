>“*The power they offer is something... Sublime and devastating at once. Dangerous because of what it could do in the wrong hands, yet somehow more dangerous in your own.*”
\-Wax and Marasi on the power of the Bands of Mourning[1]


The **Bands of Mourning** are the legendary [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]] bracers that were supposedly created by the [[Rashek\|Lord Ruler]] and could purportedly grant the wearer his powers. However, while they did grant all known [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]] and Feruchemical abilities, they were not actually made by the Lord Ruler, and instead, the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]] was involved. "Bands of Mourning" is a misleading name, probably to prevent people from finding it; it is actually a spearhead.

## Description
The Bands of Mourning is an oversized, spearhead shaped object made of all of the Allomantic metals. The different metals are interwoven into the Bands of Mourning in wavy patterns, not unlike the folds of a pattern welded blade. When first found, it stored more power than any other [[Metalmind\|metalmind]] ever before seen.
In addition to storing all the basic attributes of Feruchemy, it also grants the user the ability to use [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]. This is possible because [[Nicrosil\|Nicrosil]] can be filled with [[Investiture\|Investiture]], giving the tapper the ability to burn metals and tap or fill other metalminds. The amount of Investiture was such that [[Marasi\|Marasi]] actually saw the [[Mists\|Mists]] emanating from her when she used it, and [[Wax\|Wax]] believes that his abilities are like the strong Allomancy of old while he is using it.
Despite being incredibly powerful, it is not as heavily Invested as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
