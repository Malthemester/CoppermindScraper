The **Takers** were a squad of soldiers in [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army lead by [[Tukks\|Tukks]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was a member of.
The squad was composed of [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]], and fought using spears. Outside of battle, they also trained new soldiers, both with spear and with quarterstaff. Their training methods included corporal punishment.
It was Kaladin's first unit upon joining, and it was there that he refined his talent with the spear into proper skill. At some point, either most or all of them died, and Kaladin was transferred elsewhere, perhaps straight to leading [[Kaladin's squad\|his own squad]].
