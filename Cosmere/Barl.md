**Barl** is one of [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] deputy lawkeepers in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Barl, along with several other men and women, including [[Wayne\|Wayne]] and [[Lessie\|Lessie]] help Wax keep the peace in [[Weathering\|Weathering]] and the surrounding areas, most of the time. Despite his profession, he is something of a miscreant.
While hunting for [[Bloody Tan\|Bloody Tan]] in [[Feltrel\|Feltrel]], Barl and Wayne paired up to search one side of the town.
When Wayne left the Roughs to convince Wax to help him find the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]], Wayne left Barl in charge of Weathering, much to Wax's dismay.
