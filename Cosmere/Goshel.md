**Goshel** was a slave on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that died in a revolt led by [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]].
Kaladin led Goshel and the other slaves in a revolt against their masters one night. Goshel and all the other slaves except Kaladin were slaughtered. This final defeat led Kaladin to finally give up on trying to escape slavery. Even months later, Kaladin thought of Goshel often, and believed that he had failed him.
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] remembers him, [[Malop\|Malop]], [[Jaks\|Jaks]], [[Beld\|Beld]], [[Pedin\|Pedin]], [[Rod\|Rod]], [[Mart\|Mart]], [[Nalma\|Nalma]], [[Dallet\|Dallet]] and the squad, and [[Tien\|Tien]] whilst trying to say the fourth Ideal of the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]].
