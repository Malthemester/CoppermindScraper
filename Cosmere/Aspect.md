**Aspect** is the term that [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds]] uses for his hallucinations. Each aspect embodies a specialized area of Stephen's knowledge.

## Existence

Stephen can create a new aspect by skimming through a book or listening to a tape. If he does not already have an aspect for that subject, a new one will be created. This process does not require his attention or conscious thought.


Aspects need to be close to Stephen for him to use their information. They cannot affect the real world, so they must tell Stephen their knowledge. However, two aspects who have cell phones are able to communicate information to Stephen through them. [[J.C.\|J.C.]] was able to guide Stephen's hand in order to shoot people when Stephen was in danger.


Aspects are able to die. Once an aspect is dead, Stephen can no longer access that knowledge. They can die both by standard human ways to die (e.g. being stabbed) or by turning into a nightmare, which happens when Stephen loses control. Some aspects are be able to break the rules without becoming a nightmare, but eventually fade once too many rules have been broken. Every aspect dies in one of these ways while Stephen was trying to find Sandra.

## Known Aspects
When Stephen took the case of [[Razon's camera\|Razon's camera]], he had 45 living aspects. Two aspects, [[Kalyani\|Kalyani]] and [[Arnaud\|Arnaud]], were added in that case, increasing the total number of living aspects to 47. While investigating the death of [[Panos Maheras\|Panos Maheras]], Stephen unintentionally manifested the aspect [[Rahul\|Rahul]], bringing the total number of living aspects to 48. During the Panos case, Stephen began to feel that he was accumulating too many aspects, though he later unintentionally created the aspect [[Jenny\|Jenny]], and and may have created others between the Panos case and receiving [[Sandra\|Sandra's]] request for help. While searching for Sandra, all of the aspects were either killed, transformed into nightmares, or faded. Two aspects, [[Ignacio\|Ignacio]] and [[Justin\|Justin]], died before the Razon case and and are marked below with a †.
