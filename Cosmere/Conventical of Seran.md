## Geography
The Conventical of Seran lies far south of Luthadel in the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]], relatively close to the [[River Seran\|River Seran]] and its lakes [[North Seran\|North Seran]] and [[South Seran\|South Seran]].
It is built in a large crater-like depression in the land. This valley has steep rocky slopes, is about three hundred feet deep and is almost too wide to look at the other side with the bare eye. The crater is surrounded by gently sloping hills, and no roads lead to it. All these reasons make the Conventical of Seran hard to defend, but even harder to find in the first place.

## Architecture
### Exterior
The Conventical's walls are built from dark stone and are flat, broad and impressive. It has steel plates bolted to some of the outside sections of the building, covered by some rust, moss and ash. Its massive gate doors are also made of steel. The whole building doesn't have any windows, and has an ominous look.

### Interior
Inside, it is almost completely dark, as the fortress has no exterior windows. The interior walls and columns also have steel sheets bolted to them, and unlike the plates on the outside, don't have any stains and are buffed to create patterns and shapes on the walls. The floor is made of large reflecting square steel tiles. The rooms are high, large and hardly furnished, the doorways don't have doors, and the hewn out of stone stairs have high steps.
In general the whole interior is dark, square-shaped, covered by steel plates and without decoration, except for carvings in the steel.
The ground floor doesn't have a clear purpose, it only serves as entry. On the upper floor(s) are the [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitors']] quarters. The basement contains the room where [[Hemalurgy\|new Inquisitors are made]]. Even lower is the cave-like room where [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]] carved his [[Kwaan's inscription\|inscription]] in a large steel plate.

## History
### During the Final Empire
The [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] built the Conventical as a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] laboratory. During the one thousand years of his reign, he conducted several experiments in hope of creating new Hemalurgic constructs. Due to the nature of Hemalurgy, many died in the process. But all the attempts turned out to be failure, as the Lord Ruler was unable to create anything on top of the three he already knew: [[Koloss\|Koloss]], [[Kandra\|Kandra]] and [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]].

### After the Collapse
After the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler's]] death, the [[Inquisitors\|Inquisitors]] and high [[Obligator\|obligators]] of the [[Canton of Inquisition\|Canton of Inquisition]] retreated to the Conventical of Seran. A few months before [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] release from the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]], the Inquisitors and Obligators abandoned the building, killing the servants and taking everything useful upon their departure.
When Marsh discovers that the Conventical is abandoned, he investigated it together with [[Sazed\|Sazed]]. Marsh climbed down the crater via a cable attached that ran down to the Conventical, whereas Sazed used his [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] [[Iron\|iron]] to reduce his weight and drift down easily. The two of them worked together to open the building's massive steel doors, Marsh using [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] [[Pewter\|pewter]] and Sazed his Feruchemical pewter.
Once inside, Sazed started archiving what he saw in his [[Coppermind\|coppermind]], while Marsh left to find something specific (although undefined) in the Inquisitor's quarters, but concluded that the Inquisitors must have taken it with them upon their departure. Sazed found his way down to the room that held [[Kwaan's inscription\|Kwaan's inscription]], and made a quick rubprint copy with charcoal as Marsh insisted on leaving soon.
Two weeks after [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] release from the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] Sazed returned to the Conventical, alone. He compared his copy of Kwaan's inscription with the original, and noticed that his copy didn't match the text carved in steel, as expected.

## Trivia
[[Brandon\|Brandon]] is planning to write more from [[Marsh\|Marsh's]] viewpoint in the future and reveal what Marsh hoped to find in the Conventical.
The prologue of [[The Hero of Ages\|The Hero of Ages]] possibly takes place in the Conventical of Seran.
