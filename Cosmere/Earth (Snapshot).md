|**Earth (Snapshot)**|

The setting of the novella [[Snapshot\|Snapshot]] is an alternate Earth in 2018. The story focuses on a single day spent inside a [[Snapshot (event)\|Snapshot]], a perfect recreation of another, earlier day, where [[Anthony Davis\|Anthony Davis]] and [[Chaz\|Chaz]] attempt to track a serial killer. Besides having the snapshot device, the Earth in Snapshot differs from real Earth in a few ways. Self-driving cars appear to be popular; about half of all cars in [[New Clipperton\|New Clipperton]] are self-driving and some places, including Mexico City, have already outlawed manually-driven cars. New Clipperton and Mexico City are both Independent City-States. The Restored American Union is the original builder of the Snapshot program but decided to leave it when they pulled out of New Clipperton. Otherwise, it appears to resemble real-world Earth in 2018.
