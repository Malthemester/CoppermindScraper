**Kim** is a professor of history at [[Armedius Academy\|Armedius Academy]].
He is of Asian descent; his parents emigrated from [[JoSeun\|JoSeun]] after he was born. His employment at the academy was contentious as some parents believed he would skew their children's perception of history.
[[Joel\|Joel]] purposefully flunked Kim's final and got sent to the [[Thomas York\|Principal]], but then got sent back and completed it properly before the end of the lesson.
Kim refutes the argument from [[Hatch\|Professor Hatch]] that [[Melody\|Melody]] & Joel's dueling is against the rules.
