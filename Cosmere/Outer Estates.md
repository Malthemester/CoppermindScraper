The **Outer Estates** is the region immediately beyond the [[Elendel\|Elendel]] suburbs. It is a broad ring of orchards, fields and pastures that feed the city; this flora dwindles as one approaches the suburbs.
[[Wax\|Wax]] found the quiet, peaceful atmosphere of the Outer Estates to be odd and boring, to the point that it made him somewhat uncomfortable and anxious when they went there to examine the site of the most recent [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] attack on train cars.
According to [[Lord Harms\|Lord Harms]], his illegitimate daughter [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] had spent most of her life living in the Outer Estates before coming to the city to attend university.
When [[Wayne\|Wayne]] disguises himself as a [[House Tekiel\|House Tekiel]] guard so that Wax can sneak into the [[Breaknaught\|Breaknaught]], he pretends to have spent most of his time in the Outer Estates serving a Lord [[Evenstrom Tekiel\|Evenstrom Tekiel]].
The Outer Estates are also where [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn]] and [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]] faked their deaths to work with the [[Set\|Set]]; the story that made it to the public was that their horse bolted while were taking a carriage ride and the carriage went over a cliff. Presumably, such an accident did actually occur and was responsible for the death of their other family members, but Edwarn and Telsin managed to survive.
