>“*Being an Elantrian only makes me more proud to wear this wound. I received it protecting our people.*”
\-Saolin[2]


**Saolin** is an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He became captain of the guards in [[New Elantris\|New Elantris]].

## Appearance and Personality
Saolin is old for a soldier, probably close to retirement. He is a well-muscled man, with a nose that appears to have been broken several times, and he is missing a couple of teeth.
Being an experienced warrior, he is not easily unsettled and recognizes direct orders. Like all soldiers in Count Eondel's legion he is well disciplined and honorable, and Saolin is proud to be considered part of the best soldiers in Arelon. At first he questions [[Raoden\|Raoden]], but after hearing him praise Count Eondel Saolin becomes loyal to Raoden. He insists on forming a honor guard for his leader, gets disturbed when Raoden leaves the guarded area of their settlement without warning, and refuses to let him fight because leaders are too valuable.
During his time defending New Elantris Saolin gathers a few wounds, and since the [[Reod\|Reod]] an Elantrian's pain never goes away. Yet Saolin does not mourn his wounds, but is proud to wear them, as a reminder that he received them with honor while defending his people. While a great soldier, he is completely lacking in stealth.

## History
Before being taken by the Shaod, Saolin was a soldier in Count [[Eondel\|Eondel's]] legion.
He was thrown into Elantris together with [[Maare\|Maare]] and [[Riil\|Riil]]. As soon as the city gates closed behind their backs, Raoden sent [[Galladon\|Galladon]] off at a dash so the men of Shaor's gang would follow. This way the three newcomers could safely be led away from the courtyard at the gates, albeit with a lie from Raoden that Galladon just ran off with a cure.
Once brought to safety, Saolin pledged his sword to Raoden, after hearing him praise Count Eondel who he used to work for. He started holding watch over the chapel the small gang used as their base, and soon received a real sword to replace his improvised spear, given to him by Raoden who acquired it out of the city. He also built a makeshift watchtower.
As more people joined Raoden's band, Saolin gathered a squad of soldiers and became their captain, and insisted on forming an honor guard for his leader. This proved to be beneficial, as Saolin was able to ward off a surprise attack by Shaor's men and save Raoden from any injuries, winning enough time for Dashe and three other soldiers to join his ranks and together they were able to defeat the outnumbering assailants.
To take things further, they sectioned off a marginally defensible section of town to be New Elantris, and sentries were placed at every intersection to watch for approaching marauders. This left time for Saolin to retrieve new people being thrown into Elantris and guide them to their settlement, a task he shared with Karata. Saolin also began teaching simple combat techniques to those capable as a means of self-defense, but he could use only the safest and most elementary training methods to prevent any wounds.

>“*Failed my lord. Failed my lord Spirit. Failed, failed, failed...*”
\-Saolin's Hoed mantra[5]

When Princess [[Sarene\|Sarene]] distributed food to the Elantrians as part of her [[Widow's Trial\|Widow's Trial]], Saolin defended the courtyard from Shaor's men out of fear that they would harm the nobles who entered the city. This went well for a while, until Saolin slipped while fighting and got a deep cut in his sword arm. While he grew proficient at fighting with his left hand, his squad of soldiers grew too thin to defend both New Elantris and the courtyard. Saolin realized that they wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer, and planned to ambush Shaor's men as they approached the courtyard in a desperate attempt to defeat them, however, the ambush failed. Saolin got severely injured and became [[Hoed\|Hoed]].
Raoden and Galladon brought him to [[The Lake\|the Lake]] in which he would be dissolved and relieved from his pains.
A gravestone was erected for him along with [[Karata\|Karata]], [[Eondel\|Eondel]], [[Roial\|Roial]] and the other heroes of the [[Invasion of Arelon\|Invasion of Arelon]].
