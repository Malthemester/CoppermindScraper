The **Terris Prophecies** were a set of legends which foretells that the Hero of Ages will save the world. [[Preservation\|Preservation]] created them with incredible foresight as part of his ultimate plan to defeat [[Ruin\|Ruin]].

## Alendi and Rashek
The **Hero of Ages**, also called **Rabzeen** and the **Anamnesor**, was a prophesied savior who would supposedly take the power of the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] and use it to save the world. [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]] believed [[Alendi\|Alendi]] to be the hero, and while initially his claim was scorned by the rest of the [[Worldbringers\|Worldbringers]], eventually they conceded Kwaan had been right, earning him the prophesied title of the **Announcer**. By the time Alendi was recognized, Kwaan had started to doubt the integrity of the prophecies. However, the rest of the Worldbringers did not notice the changes in the prophecies because they trusted their copperminds, never realizing they could be altered. Kwaan eventually realized that the prophecies had been edited to require the Hero to give up the power of the Well once taken, and sent [[Rashek\|Rashek]], his nephew, to prevent Alendi from reaching the Well of Ascension. He and his trusted friends went as Alendi's packmen. Rashek killed Alendi at the end of the journey, and took up the power of Preservation at the Well of Ascension. Instead of giving it up as Alendi would have and as Ruin wished, he used it to try to protect the world, and became a [[Sliver\|Sliver]] of Preservation. From then on, Rashek pretended to be Alendi, taking his title of the Conqueror and believing himself to be the Hero of Ages.

## Vin and Sazed
After a thousand years, the same play goes on again but with Vin as the Hero of Ages. The Terris Prophecies were written in the Terris language, and all of them refer to the Hero with gender-neutral pronouns. But these pronouns were most commonly translated so that the Hero is referred to as 'he', while the word was best translated as 'it'. This lead to most assuming the Hero of Ages was male, but Sazed believed the prophecies had been using the neutral case so that they could have been refering to a female, who he believed to be Vin. The Hero of ages was prophesied to create and destroy nations. When Vin defeated the kings laying siege to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]], [[Sazed\|Sazed]] began to believe the Hero to be Vin. Eventually she became the holder of the shard Preservation, Ruin's equal and opposite, and after the death of Elend, attacked Ruin hard enough to kill him, though it killed her in the process, and unbound both Shards. As Preservation had foreseen, Sazed took them, bonding Ruin and Preservation together into Harmony and became a vessel of both shards. He fixed the world's failing ecology and renewed the land, and remained to guide and protect the world as the Hero of Ages.

## Prophecy quotes
The majority of these quotes are said in awe by Sazed while watching Vin do things making her appear to be the Hero of Ages. A record of the prophecy is never given. Note that some of these prophecies could have been changed from their original text by Ruin:

>“*The Hero of Ages shall be not a man, but a force. No nation may claim him, no woman shall keep him, and no king may slay him. He shall belong to none, not even himself.*”
\-[19]


>“*He shall defend their ways, yet shall violate them. He will be their savior, yet they shall call him heretic. His name shall be Discord, yet they shall love him for it.*”
\-[20]


>“*That which has been sundered must again begin to find its whole*”
\-[21]


>“*The Hero will have the power to save the world. But he will also have the power to destroy it.*”
\-[1]


>“*The Hero will bear the future of the world on his arms.*”
\-[1] [22]


>“*The Hero of Ages was not simply to be a warrior. He was a person who united others, who brought them together. A leader.*”
\-[17]


>“*The Hero of Ages was removed from the Terris people. He was not royalty himself, but came to it eventually.*”
\-[17]


>“*He commanded the forces of the world. Kings rode to his aid.*”
\-[17]


>“*He left ruin in his wake, but it was forgotten. He created kingdoms, and then destroyed them as he made the world anew.*”
\-[17]


>“*...One who is separated from the Terris people, a king of men, a rebel caught between two worlds.*”
\-[15]


>“*He who is not of his people, yet fulfills all of their wishes.*”
\-[16]



The following partial prophecies also exist:

\-[23]
