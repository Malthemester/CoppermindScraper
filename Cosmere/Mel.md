**Mel** is a young barmaid at [[Jez's Duty\|Jez's Duty]] in the [[Ten Rings\|Ten Rings]] section of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
On the day of [[Jor\|Jor]] and [[Kryst\|Kryst's]] wedding party, Mel served [[Adolin\|Adolin]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]], and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] drinks. After refilling Veil's glass, she took Kaladin's order; perplexed that he would only order an orange, she offered him some yellow. Veil chased her away, but when she returned with Kaladin's order, she offered him yellow again. This time Adolin spoke up to decline the offer, and Mel beamed at him, ecstatic to have a [[Highprince\|highprince]] speak to her.
