## Details
Few of the details about the Doctrine are elaborated on.

### Utilitarianism
>“* The most essential morality of mankind is to create the greatest amount of happiness among the greatest number of people while using the least amount of resources.*”
\- XinWey's Doctrine[1]


Xinwey's Doctrine promotes utilitarianism, the concept of maximizing utility being the most moral action one can take. This is evident in the States, with each Liveborn having their own individual world in which they become heroes and great leaders, accomplishing wonderful things during their lives.

### Procreation
>“* The precepts say you must choose her, and she you, and then you must meet one another and perform the act.*”
\- Besk to Kai about Xinwey's Doctrine[1]


Though the reasons behind this requirement are never fully elaborated on, it is clear that Xinwey's Doctrine feels it is important for a Liveborn to meet another Liveborn, of the opposite sex, in an intimate setting.

### Rules of Engagement
>“* Melhi, you snake! How did you hack my palace? You're violating the precepts of engagement.*”
\- Kairominas to Melhi[1]


The full extent of the rules of engagement between two Liveborn are not further detailed, but they clearly exist. Likely used as a means of keeping Liveborn that are proficient at hacking from destroying entire States, violation of these precepts brings punishment from the Wode.

### Danger
>“* I would become brain dead. Part of Xinwey's Doctrine. A person needed to experience real danger or they would never find joy in excelling. There had to be a risk of failure, the chance to die.*”
\- Kairominas about Xinwey's Doctrine[3]


Xinwey's Doctrine promotes that Liveborn have the risk of death. Simple causes, such as falling down a flight of stairs, would not warrant the Liveborn's death, but in attempting an act of heroism, or something of the like, the danger must be real.
