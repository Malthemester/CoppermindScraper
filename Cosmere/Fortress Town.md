The **forts** are settlements on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] safe from the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]]. They are inhabited by **fortfolk**, who the other inhabitants of the Forests hold in contempt for being to far removed from the Forests. They claim jurisdiction over roadways and the land immediately adjacent to them and assess taxes on the people who live there, though those people are not automatically considered fort citizens. The forts had promised to maintain the roads, but generally fall short. They offer bounties for criminals who flee into the Forest, like [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]].
