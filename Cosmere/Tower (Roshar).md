\-Kaladin's observations [1]


The **Tower** is one of the largest plateaus on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is the furthest easterly plateau discovered by the Alethi forces. It is oddly shaped, unusually massive, and [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]] seem to be fond of using it for pupating.
The Alethi [[Highprince\|Highprinces]] were beaten 29 times, never winning a skirmish on the Tower. [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] lost there twice alone and once on a joint attack with [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]].
The [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]] occurred here.
