**Shu-Dereth** is one of the major religions on [[Sel\|Sel]]. Shu-Dereth is an offshoot of [[Shu-Keseg\|Shu-Keseg]]. It was founded by [[Dereth\|Dereth]], a disciple of [[Keseg\|Keseg]]. However, Shu-Dereth differs from Shu-Keseg in the way that it focuses on the equality of obedience, rather than the equality of mind. Shu-Dereth is based on the worship of [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]], a God who is said to slumber in the earth, waiting for a time when the whole world worships him to return and rule the world. Followers of Shu-Dereth are known as Derethi, and the religion's holy book is called the Do-Dereth.
Dereth’s ideas were originally rejected in his native [[JinDo\|JinDo]]; however, they were embraced by the Fjordell. Shu-Dereth has been the official religion of Fjorden since the conversion of [[Wulfden the First\|Wulfden the First]] and has spread to all of the eastern nations. Since that time, the leader of Shu-Dereth takes receives the title [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] upon his ascension. Wyrn acts both as Jaddeth's prophet and regent during his entrapment on earth.
Fjorden’s society stratified and organized Shu-Dereth’s teachings to a martial level. As a result, Shu-Dereth is a highly militaristic religion, and is based on a regimented ranking, known as the "Great Chain."

## The Great Chain
The Great Chain is the chain that links all living members of Shu-Dereth to Wyrn and then to Jaddeth. Masters were always called hroden, but there were two different ways a servant could serve a master. One way was to swear to be someone's odiv, which was irrevocably binding. Krondet is a less binding oath, in which one listened to the counsel of his hroden, but was not morally obligated to obey. In the priesthood, all in the Great Chain are odivs and bound to do what someone higher in the chain commanded.

At the bottom of the chain are the common people; they serve the arteths and the dorven.
Dorven are the lowest level of the priesthood; they serve the arteths and the gradors.
Arteths are the lowest level that may lead a chapel by themselves; they serve the gradors.
Gradors are the level of the priesthood directly above the arteths; they generally lead the chapels in the larger cities.
Ragnets are the level directly below the gyorns; they generally oversee a region of Derethi followers.
Gyorns serve Wyrn directly; they are at the highest level of the priesthood other than perhaps some gragdets. There are only twenty of them, and they are among the most important people in the [[Fjordell Empire\|Fjordell Empire]]. They often serve as ambassadors for Wyrn to foreign nations, such as [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]]. They customarily wear red ornamental armor.
Gragdets are the leaders of monasteries; they are outside of the direct chain, although some have the authority of the gyorns (such as the gragdet of the [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]] monastery).
Wyrn is the head of the church, and is able to serve Jaddeth directly; the Wyrn has direct control over all members of Shu-Dereth.
## Beliefs & Prophecies
Shu-Dereth interpreted Keseg’s teachings of unity for all mankind to mean that all men must be united beneath the rule of one nation. Dereth taught that once all men bow before a single monarch, proving their unified nature, God would come to live among them.
The derethi believe that the souls of men who hated Jaddeth during life become [[Svrakiss\|Svrakiss]]. The Svrakiss are considered to be evil entities barred from entrance into heaven and are said to have the power to take over the bodies of living men and control their actions.
When someone who follows Shu-Dereth has bad luck or a difficult time, the Svrakiss are often blamed.
The [[Day of Empire\|Day of Empire]] is a day prophesied by Wyrn when the whole world would be converted to Shu-Dereth and Jaddeth, the Derethi god, would return to Sel.
## Monasteries
Entering Derethi priests joined one of many monasteries. The monasteries provide religious training as well as training for various tasks:


## Trivia
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

The god [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] could be based on the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Dominion\|Dominion]], as Derethi-majority Fjorden seeks to expand the Fjordell Empire across Sel, similar to the Shardic Intent of Dominion.
