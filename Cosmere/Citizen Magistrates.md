>“*You are fools! One day, the men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal, will come to you. And you will be ruled by them.*”
\-Miles Dagouter's last words[1]

**Citizen Magistrates** is a brand of cigars sold in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] and the surrounding areas on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Citizen Magistrates are sold in a red and gold painted box with large lettering spelling out the brand on top. They are a very expensive brand of cigar.

## History
Citizen Magistrates are the favored cigar of [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]], leader of the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]]. Miles took notes on the comings and goings of [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Mister Suit]] in an old box of Citizen Magistrates. He later gave that box to [[Clamps\|Clamps]] to support the fuse and detonator of the explosive trap he built in the foundry in [[Longard\|Longard]]. Lady [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] recovered the box, but neither they nor High Lord [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] could figure out the meanings of the numbers written inside. The presence of the box, however, confirmed Wax's suspicions that Miles was the leader of the Vanishers. He later figured out the meaning of the numbers, and used it to find Mister Suit on a train.
Wayne finds a Citizen Magistrates cigar box at the [[Winsting Innate\|Winsting Innate]] crime scene early in Shadows of Self, and replaces it with an apple.

## Theories
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

In his final moments, Miles shouts out that the people of Elendel will soon be ruled by "men of gold and red". Precisely what this means, and who they are is uncertain, but there is some significant connection between this and the gold and red of the box of Citizen Magistrate cigars. It is possible that these men of gold and red are the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]], a separate group of humans on Scadrial. It is uncertain, what if anything, this signifies.
