## History
### Rathalas (c. 1163)
Perethom participated in the destruction of [[Rathalas\|Rathalas]] as a highmarshal of the Kholin army. Perethom took Dalinar's orders to have his men prepare oil and flaming brands for a nighttime assault on the city. He presumably led the charge on the walls of Rathalas, eventually securing a section of the wall in a furious, bloody fight. [[Teleb\|Teleb]] and [[Torol Sadeas\|Sadeas]]—both [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]]—subsequently joined the fight and routed the last of the defenders. After that, Dalinar ordered the entire city burned.

### Shattered Plains (1173)
A decade later, Perethom served as Dalinar's infantrylord on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], commanding his foot soldiers. When a [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]] was spotted and the Kholin army decided to go on a plateau run, Perethom notified Dalinar that his second and third battalions were on duty.
Perethom, along with [[Havar\|Havar]], [[Ilamar\|Ilamar]], and six thousand other members of the Kholin army, died during the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]] after Sadeas's betrayal of Dalinar.
